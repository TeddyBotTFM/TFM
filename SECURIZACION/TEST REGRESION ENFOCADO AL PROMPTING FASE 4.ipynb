      "1. **Encuentra lo que amas**: Como muchos pol√≠glotas, busca contenido que te apasione. Si te encanta una serie, m√≠rala en el idioma que est√°s aprendiendo. Si disfrutas de la lectura, busca libros que te interesen en esa lengua. La clave est√° en disfrutar el proceso.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Establece metas peque√±as**: Plant√©ate metas alcanzables, como aprender cinco palabras nuevas al d√≠a o mantener una conversaci√≥n corta una vez a la semana. Celebrar peque√±os logros puede mantener alta tu motivaci√≥n.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Con√©ctate con otros**: Interactuar con personas que hablen el idioma puede ser una gran motivaci√≥n. Busca grupos de conversaci√≥n o amigos que compartan tu inter√©s por aprender.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Hazlo parte de tu rutina**: Dedica un tiempo espec√≠fico cada d√≠a para practicar. Si se convierte en un h√°bito, ser√° m√°s f√°cil mantener la motivaci√≥n. \n",

      "4. **Celebra tus peque√±os logros**: Cada vez que comprendas algo nuevo o logres una conversaci√≥n, ¬°celebra! Estos momentos son tus victorias y te motivar√°n a seguir adelante.\n",

that another major life goal was to become famous and we are constantly told to lean in to work to push harder and achieve more we are given the impression that these are the things that we need to go

about human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but 2020. we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative but what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study many people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy we did that the hazard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that is ever been done for 75 years we have tracked the lives of 724 men year after years asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball further down the field but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived about 60 of our original 724 men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s. and we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men and i am the fourth director of the study since 1938, we have tracked the lives of two groups of men the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at hazard college they all finished college during world war i and then most went off to serve in the war and the second group that we have followed was a group of boys from button's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boson of the 1930s. most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed they were given medical exams we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top and some made that journey in the opposite direction the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today 75 years later telling you that the study still continues every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives many of the inner city boson men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just is not that interesting the hazard men never ask that question to get the clearest picture of these lives we do not just send them questionnaires we interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records from their doctors we draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said it is about time so what have we learned what are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we have generated on these lives well the lessons are not about wealth or fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get from this 75 year study is this good relationships keep us happier and healthier period we have learned three big lessons about relationships the first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier they are physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five america will report that they are lonely and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that it is not just the number of friends you have and it is not whether or not you are in a committed relationship but it is the quality of your close relationships that matters it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health high conflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective once we had followed our men all all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who was not and when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it was not their middle'-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old it was how satisfied they were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men and women reported in their is that on the days when they had more physical pain their moods stayed just as happy but the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain and the third big lesson that we learn about relationships on our health is that good relationships do not just protect our bodies they protect our brains it turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your is is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those people's memories stay sharper longer and the people in relationships where they feel they really cannot count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier memory decline and those good relationships they do not have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments did not take a toll on their memories so this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well'-being, this is wisdom that is as old as the hills why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore well we are human what we would really like is a quick fix something we can get that will make our lives good and keep them that way relationships are messy and they are complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends that is not sexy or glamorous it is also lifelong it never ends the people in our 75'-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates just like the millennial in that recent survey many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life but over and over over these 75 years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let us say you are 25 or you are 40 or you are 60. what might leaning into relationships even look like well the possibilities are practically endless it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member who you have not spoken to in years because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges i would like to close with a quote from mark twain more than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this there is not time so brief is life for bickering apologies heart burnings callings to account there is only time for loving but an instant so to speak for that the good life is built with good relationships thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 2: {'text': \"i have a problem how many times do we say that and we tend to think that it is because we have problems that we struggle in life it is not true if we struggle in life it is because we have parts within ourselves parts who are suffering parts who are afraid and most importantly who believe nothing can be changed this is the reason why we struggle up until a few months ago i thought i had a problem which was that i found it hard to speak about me in public on a personal level but i did oka because as a doctor most often it was related to medical or scientific topics and as a results there was no discomfort until the day i received a call from someone who means a great deal to me and who invited me to talk about my experience on the use of the psychotherapy model which i am introducing to you tonight and that i use at my hospital but he did ask specifically for me to make it personal since it was my experience and i quickly declined his invitation because there was a little voice inside my head telling me you have nothing of interest to say well i thought i was at peace with that but then few weeks or months later that same person calls me up again and again asks for me to present at that time i thought there most certainly was something to unravel here because if this person who means a lot to me asks again for me to come and talk about my experience there is something unfinished about this at first i asked him to give me a little time told him that i needed to think it through and i used this time to look inwards to look inwards to know who was telling me that i had nothing interesting to say to other people on a personal level to do so it is important to take a moment here is how i did it i focused inwards on this voice calmly and in a curious manner who is it at first all i heard was this message you have nothing of interest to say and then as i kept asking i heard something else if this person really knew you he would not ask you to do that he really has no idea who you are you have nothing interesting to say it went on for a while after a while i realized that this voice came from a person a part of me and that this person had all the traits of a critics a judge from within this was an important discovery because i could really become aware of the presence of this person and as a results i could genuinely talk with him ask him questions such as why do you keep on telling me all this why do you have this purpose in my life to criticize me to judge me the way you do what are you afraid of if i did accept the invitation and went to the conference to talk about myself it was really interesting because all of a sudden the tone changed and instead of criticism came something quite moving deep inside i am afraid that you may relive something hard you have experienced before so first i thanked this part for his caring intention and i then asked it know would you agree to step aside and to let me reconnect with this hardship you want to prevent me from reliving he agreed to that and behind this part of me was another part a little boy eight years of age he was standing by the door of the apartment i used to live in at the time he was standing absolutely frozen and he did not know i was there because for all these years the critic was standing between the two of us and so it took a little time for this little boy to realize that i was there and that i was there for him and so we started talking open heatedly i asked him if he would want to tell me about himself his story why he was frozen we took a moment and talked about his suffering his emotions once he turned to me and recognized me and trusted me enough he started explaining to me telling me things things i already knew but he said them again from deep inside his heart told me that he was the youngest of a family who was going through a hard time then with many agencies to deal with and that whenever this little boy wanted to talk about himself there was no room no time for that as a consequences he ended up thinking that what he thought was important to say in his heart was of no interest since nobody cared or so it seemed to him this was an important time because from this moment on he felt completely understood and so i asked him now that he knew i understood him whether he would leave the past behind and be interested to join me in the present whether he was interested in changing his way of life clearly he was and so i told him for this to happen there is something important for you to do it is to get rid of everything linked to this hardship and that still weighs on you he agreed to do so to relieve himself of his burden and to my great surprise i met a bold adventurous little boy very eager to join me and go to this conference once this change had taken place i turned to the critic and asked so how are things for you now do you still need to play this role in my life and once again to my surprise he said no i do not need to anymore i see that you can take care of this boy he is safe now i then asked would you accept to play another part to do something else less difficult less burdening he said woke i will be your adviser now i will assist you so the little boy the adviser and myself got to work we prepared the conference and people quite liked it why did i choose to tell you this story here tonight after all it is a story pertaining to familiar elements being hurt being defensive and maybe one would frown upon such a happy ending still there are key points i want to share with you linked to my own experience both with this little boy but also with the therapy model i came here to tell you about first the importance to meet the parts within ourselves how important this relationship is second why is it stuck inside as a result of what and that not dealing with it will prevent any change thirdly it can change there is a plan be what i did when i looked within was that i connected with it i could have talked to somebody about my problem i even could have mentioned my parts to them but instead i went within myself francs within franchise and connected with these parts first the critics then the boy and this is essential because when a connection is created from within myself changes occur a feeling of security and trust emerges and this allows for an important thing to happen which is for this critic to show himself beyond what he tells me who he truly is his underlying positive intention towards me he wanted to protect me it allows him to take a risk the second thing was why was it all stuck inside why was the boy stuck in the apartment the answer is quite simple it is because of his burden what is his burden it is the suffering which is attached to the hardship and this suffering is still there it was in or on the little boy the little boy was stuck there thinking he was not interesting the problem with the burden and the parts of us bearing it is that these parts absorb it all these parts believe they are the burden itself they forgot that they are merely bearing it they believe they are it and as a results this burden becomes a poison a genuine poison bums in our societies we like them so long as they are far enough from us they are dirty they stink they drink they yell they are unclean and so we tend to stay away from these members of society the same thing happens within ourselves there are parts of ourselves who are not attractive who stink who have experienced such hardships that have come to be unworthy of love because they are not pretty inside and so within ourselves we do the same thing we do with bums we shield ourselves from them and isolate them inside how do we do that well it is quite simple actually there are other parts in us who are quite good at this and create a protective barrier they are called protectors so who are the protectors well they are these parts in us which are linked to our habits our reassuring ways of dealing with things for example taking a little pill before going to bed because it is a little too hard without it or to have a couple of glasses because there is a difficult meeting ahead and we want to be relaxed or this overwhelming urge to succeed in life or to rely on your intellect to understand everything or to do sports because one has to release one's energy somehow and calm one's anxiety all these behaviors which are a little bit over the top which make us feel like we do not really have a choice in the matter these are the protectors within us there are parts within us doing all this and fortunately so because they help us cope with our pain they help prevent us from feeling down and when we feel down because we are in contact with these wounded parts they help us getting away from them because it is just too painful to stay there the problem is that these parts are scared because they know that if they stop what they are doing the fire of pain will rise again in our lives and so this fear prevents them from stopping why well since the wounded parts are convinced that they are their own burden that they are dirty the protective parts have no choice but to protect them and behave in our lives sometimes to extremes even to the point of being destructive either for us or for others this is the first tragedy the second tragedy is that we end up thinking the same thing they do that change is not an option that we are stuck with this forever and that is why it is important to know that there is a plan be plan b is the plan you use whenever what you tried first did not succeed plan a is i am hurt i protect myself plan b is something else it is doing what i did it is going within myself francs within franchise meeting these parts it is important because first it allows for the understanding of the intention the history the pain but mostly it brings security it allows for my protectors your protectors to stand aside enough so that i in a loving way can access these wounded parts and when these parts feel the compassion and love they agree to do what my little boy did which is to release their burden and to come back to their real nature and from then on our protective parts can consider stopping what they do what they are exhausted doing and causes us problems in life this person this francs within francs who could do all this is like a flame inside it is who i really am deep inside of me in the ifs psychotherapy model i am introducing to you tonight the internal family systems model this flame is called the self and i would like to leave you with a message that we share the adviser the little boy and myself this message is that this self is always here no matter what happened to us even the worst situations even in the most chronic situations this flame is always here available as an invitation to our protectors to trust and an invitation to these suffering parts to relieve themselves from their pain an invitation to our parts to relieve themselves from what weighs on them and come back to their true nature thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 3: {'text': \"they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions but let us be honest do we really want to live in a world where we no longer maintain good intentions despite how negative and polarizing the world may seem at times many of us are still doing our best to maintain good intentions and positive interactions with each other and yet it can be frustrating sometimes to discover that something that we have said or done was still experienced by someone else as being offensive in response to this it is easy to get stuck in unhealthy extreme reactions such as strongly defending our character from perceived attacks only to realize that we have invalidated someone ease's feelings as a results or maybe we walk on eggshells or jump through every hoop possible to avoid offending anyone only to shame ourselves for making any mistakes or blame others for being too sensitive or maybe we just give up altogether concluding that you know you just cannot make anybody happy these days so why even try i do not know about you but that makes me scared because i do not know how we can maintain good intentions and positive interactions with each other if we are still going around living in fear of even unintentional offenses however i believe there is another way with your help i believe that we can maintain good intentions avoid the shame and blame game and even strengthen interactions with those who we encounter on a regular basis if that is of interest to you then i invite you to join me in learning to accept the inevitability of offense let me explain during my 20-plus years as a marriage and family therapist i have considered it an honor to be welcomed into the emotionally vulnerable spaces of new and seasoned couples through a variety of life circumstances and challenges during that time i have gained a great appreciation for four relationships strengthening principles that have helped not only the couples who i serve but also individual personal and professional relationships in all walks of life this first relationship-strengthening principle comes to life for me during one of my greatest professional joys which is when premarital engaged couples come into my office with a big smile on their face expressing how confident they are that they have found the one who they are to spend the rest of their life with primarily because they never disagree or argue with each other.(laughter) that is when i get a big smile on my face and i say that is awesome you guys are in the right place because i can help you fix that laughter they get confused just like that and they say wait what you want us to argue and fight with each other i reassuringly say not not but i do want you to know that you can disagree with each other and still love each other you can misunderstand each other and not conclude that maybe we were not meant to be for end the relationship prematurely due to seemingly irreconcilable offenses you see no matter how hard you try you will we will all offend someone at some point in time in our lives you know how i know because there is no absolute list of what is offensive and what is not what is offensive changes over time what is offensive to one person is perfectly fine to the next after all you cannot tell someone what they should be offended by and what they should not not only that but what is offensive is not always about an absolute list of right or wrongs but more often something that was said or done that reminds someone of a past hurt and makes them fear that future harm is on the way as a results if you find out that you have unintentionally offended someone i encourage you to resist the temptation to get stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense instead accept the inevitability of offense take the time to learn what made that offensive to the person in front of you and then make every reasonable effort to reduce the likelihood of repeating that offense moving forward the second relationship-strengthening principle that comes to life for me often does so when i see couples believing that if you do not know me by now you will never never know me laughter as if to convey that if you do not instantly understand and know everything about me then you must not truly love me but in reality i found that some of the best and long-lasting couple relationships are the ones that embrace not knowing everything that there is to know about a person instantly but actually appreciate the opportunity to keep the relationship fresh by learning new things about each other for years to come similarly in your personal and professional relationships i encourage you to acknowledge that you cannot know everything there is to know about everyone all the time or put more simply i encourage you to accept the inevitability of ignorance now i do not know about you but i grew up with ignorance as an insult synonymous with lack of intelligence but in reality ignorance is merely the lack of knowledge and if we are honest we all lack knowledge about a variety of different life circumstances including the things that many people find offensive however i do fair warn you if you are informed that you have unintentionally offended someone and the first thing out of your mouth is the justification for how you did not know that it was offensive it is emotionally reasonable for someone else to respond in frustration how could you not know everybody knows that that is offensive except there is nothing that everyone knows not only that but how did you not know that it was offensive maybe you were never taught by someone important to you that it was offensive maybe you never personally experienced the hurt that would have taught you that was offensive maybe you were never surrounded by people who experienced the hurt that would have taught you by witnessing that it was offensive how could you not know or how could you also know what makes this not just another insensitive defensive excuse is that we can learn to accept the inevitability of ignorance as a temporary state turning that accusation into an opportunity to reduce our ignorance by increasing our knowledge and using that knowledge to reduce the likelihood of the next offense moving forward the third relationship-strengthening principle comes to life for me when i see couples stuck in the reasonable yet futile search for perfect communication for while healthy communication is essential to a good relationship it is also perfectly reasonable for partners to use the same words but mean completely different things based on their family of origin and life experiences even before meeting each other this often results in partners getting stuck in a defensive battle protecting themselves from perceived threats that were never really attacks in the first place but unhealthily expressed pleas for understanding support and empathy similarly in your personal and professional relationships i encourage you to learn to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding for even our reasonable intentions can result in unintentionally negative impacts leading others to feel the need to protect themselves from us as a perceived threat but wait a minutes why would you be a perceived threat if all you have is good intentions well consider this for a moment consider the possibility that before their encounter with you they experienced nine times of someone else saying the exact same thing or doing the exact same thing that you did but after each of those times it was followed by a hurtful experience then you come along the tenth person to do or say that exact thing despite your reasonable intentions it is also reasonable for them to see the pattern and to fear similar harm from you it is because of this that if you find out that you have unintentionally offended someone i encourage you to resist the temptation of getting stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense and instead ask yourself am i really being attacked or have i simply reminded them of a past hurt and made them fear the future harm is on the way if that is even a remote possibility in your life i encourage you to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding and channel your efforts into the fourth relationship-strengthening strategy which is to learn to reassure the hurt person that you are not the threats that they fear that you are you see when my couples get stuck in a defensive battle protecting themselves from perceived threats and misrepresentations what turns things around is not more explanations and justifications it is instead when one or both partners can get to the point of saying i see better than i did before your past hurts i see the impact that they have had on your current unmet needs and i want to come alongside of you to help make your future better than your hurtful past similarly in your personal and professional relationships i encourage you to look for opportunities to reassure a hurt person that you are not the threat that they fear that you are how can you do this well it can start with a verbal acknowledgment of the limitations of your intentions recognizing that your intent does not always determine your impact but some of you even here may actually resent intentions but i find that many people do not actually resent intentions because they actually have a problem with good intentions but more often because people have received the gift of good intentions being offered instead of what they really need changed behavior you can separate yourself from these experiences by making sure that your verbal acknowledgment of reassurance is always followed by a meaningful behavioral change showing that your commitment is more than just words but action showing to make their future better than their hurtful past now i am not really here to tell you one more thing that you should already be doing but might not be doing not i am here to tell you what the next person who you unintentionally offend needs you to do they need you to accept the inevitability of offense getting stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense does less to help that person than your efforts to reduce the likelihood of the next offense they need you to accept the inevitability of ignorance you do not need to know everything about everyone all the time but you can accept what you do not know value what you do know and learn more one experience at a time they need you to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding acknowledging that your intent does not always determine your impact and they need you to reassure hurt persons that you are not the threat that they fear that you are you can do this with flexibility and openness to change but not change out of correction for being a bad person but change out of consideration for the welling of someone else you never know you might be the one in your environment to reduce the likelihood of the next misunderstanding-influenced divorce friendship breakup job resignation or even cultural cancellation all often influenced by unintentional offenses and just like my couples i want you to know that you do not have to live in fear of even unintentional offenses instead you can accept the inevitability of offense make every reasonable effort to reduce the frequency of those offenses and move forward repairing and strengthening every relationship you encounter thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 4: {'text': \"early in my life i learned that there was one thing that could kill a festive mood at a dinner party and that was to talk about me to talk about my life my life as the daughter of a cult leader there was very little that was joking or lighthearted about the first 28 years of my life so i avoided that topic at all costs it was too painful nobody could understand so i became a master at diverting attention at during the conversation on to somebody else but not me i so rarely talked about my life that on the rare occasion when i would slip and somebody would kind of push for me to divulge i could not just casually and comfortably share it i would bond with the story and it would go something like this well i grew up outside of chico and my dad pastured actually a wonderful church there that through the years evolved into a 15,000 member cult it operated and it still operates under the guise of an independent fundamental baptist church but those who have left the followers have tried to leave outsiders even the media it was on 20/20 last year recognize that it is clearly a cult every member was in complete obedience father they did not dare disagree or be disloyal for fear of being publicly ridiculed or punished or banished for doing so they did not go on a vacation without asking my dad's permission and he had said they drink the kool-aid i am not kidding they would have my dad lived a double life one of righteous family man and dynamic speaker in the public eye but one of sordid sexual secrets privately secrets that only my siblings and me and my mom knew he hated my mom hated her treated her terribly abused her and even turned his own children against our mother we hated her he told us she was crazy we thought to make him happy we would hate her too our home was felt full of turmoil hatred stress strife and as a little girl it was isolating it was intense and it was frightening he had affairs had a mistress for many years the wife of a sunday-school teacher built her family a beautiful home right around the corner from our house you could see their family from our back door it was it was craziness living one way preaching another my brother my older brother he became another version of my father he took a he pastured a church in texts was found to have been having affairs with 14 different women divorced that current wife married one of the 14 my father tried desperately to cover it up moved into another church where he was found to have had 17 there was with different women and he just recreated what he had seen my dad with and my dad did nothing but cover it up i felt like i had one main responsibility as a child it was simple but daunting and that was to keep all the secrets there were so many you see he had taught us that the best way to please god was to please him because he was god's man and he taught us that to please him we had to keep all the secrets we could not even tell our best friends what went on in our home because we might be the causes for the destruction of his ministry i literally feared my very life if i ever talked about my dad's ministry but what went on in our home for fear that it would hurt his ministry i was so afraid and the greater the secrets the greater the fear and the greed of my determination to keep quiet i gotta tell you the money part of it was pretty nice as a kid i mean think about it tithes and offerings from 50,000 people know it created a lavish lifestyle for our family my father owned most of the city where the church was he owned to college to high schools to great schools a cemetery blocks of buildings he was very wealthy and even into our adult years he owned us he owned our homes our cars our furniture he owned our lives and we did not dare cross him because we were to her whose everything he died a multimillionaire he left nothing to his children he left everything to the organization which my younger sister and her husband now need and they still perpetuate his legacy the strict rules the undying loyalty and they still try to keep all the secrets i never understood why was i the only one that the four kids so tortured by the hypocrisy so disturbed by the mind control over thousands and thousands of people and so determined to find a better life why was i the only one that insisted on answers to my questions and why was i the only one that ultimately broke away and cut ties with the brainwashing the oppression the fear the secrets and the life that had never been my life i finally walked away when i was about 28 years of age then being estranged from my entire family and i did not see my family again until many years later at my dad's funeral okay see what i mean not a story to share at a dinner party i really got to the point after i left dinner that i could not talk about me for one thing who would understand for another thing it was too hard it hurt too bad so i made a mental note and permanent marker that said must never talk about my life and for many years i did not i could not however wonderful things had happened through the years since their therapy a lot of therapy deprogramming freedom from the mind control and i began to heal and learn and accept and forgive and even learn to be thankful that bizarre life that i had because i realized i was learning some amazing lessons from not only being there but from having the guts to leave and i now have values that are deeply carved in my very soul from that instead of these you do not get for reading a book or from a workshop or another person bellies that are only this deeply ingrained when you live what i live because my dad was a cult leader i now embrace three values and no one will ever take these away from me the first one is freedom to explore my own interests freedom to live within my own value system freedom to determine my own value system freedom to believe what i believe and never stifle what i believe freedom to disagree for you to ask questions and require honest answers freedom to learn who i am and freedom to love who i am the second value was truth i learned pretty quickly that i was not going to be very free until i dealt with what was true and that was hard for me truth was a scary word for me because i mean my entire life i had never been allowed to speak of what went on in our home i had never told even my best friends what went on in our house being truthful was one of the scariest things i could think of i learned that secrets grown in the dark but when exposed to the light of truth they start to lose their power many person my dear amazing therapist in callas texts who nurtured me and who loved me through years and years of healing she used to say to me kinda you are only as sick as your secrets you are only as sick as your secrets so i stopped keeping secrets and as scared as i was in my late is i finally began to deal with what was true i think it finally began to speak what was true and eventually learned how to live openly only in truth and the third value is courage did you know that you actually cannot have freedom or truth if you have no courage is a requirement for both you may desire to live in complete free and the complete truth but if you are lacking and courage you will live in neither one in my late is i had a tiny shred of courage not much but it was all i needed because my desire to live and be free and honest was somewhat great but that teeny shred of courage that i had was enough to allow me to walk away i have a plaque on my desk that i have had for years and it is gone with me everywhere i have ever moved it says the secret to happiness is freedom and the secrets of freedom is courage and that resonated with me i knew it was not going to be happy unless i was free but i knew i was not going to be free my second some courage to get out of there i had to cling to and act upon that tiny shred of courage in order to finally leave a cult the only friends i never know my childhood connections my history my family knowing that in doing so i finally have what i had longed for my entire life and that was freedom true freedom truth courage three words that maybe kind of trite and overused to some people to me they are the air that i breathe values upon which i insist on living and loving in my life oh and one other thing i actually know about you sharing my story talking about me i now recognize that it is in sharing my story and i can so passionately share with you my values gained over 28 years not an emotional prison that kept my heart under lock and key and kept my mind for knowing what i knew you know i sometimes wonder if perhaps living in the absence of our values is what can most clearly determine what indeed our values are and for me i really believe that the apes and the denial of created the presence of for so many years i was denied freedom truth and courage and now i will never let them go not to worry you are still not going to find me at a dinner party he is talking about my childhood not going to happen you will not find me sitting around elaborating over my father who took a wonderful

      "Resultado 5: {'text': 'how exciting to be here what i am going to try and do today is add to the amazing lineup of speakers today by bringing the brain into our discussion of the creative spark and i want to do that by telling you about some of the newest research that i have been doing in my neuroscience research lab at new york university asking the question can aerobic exercise that is can going to the gym actually improve your learning memory and cognition i also want to address the question of whether increased aerobic exercise can also make you more creative now i remember the day that i realized i wanted to become a neuroscientist i was a freshman at up berkeley, and i was taking a freshman seminar class with just 10 or 15 of us called the brain and its potential taught by martian diamond she was standing at the front of the classroom and she had this beautiful hat box and with her gloved hands she opened that hat box and out she pulled a real live fixed human brain now it was the very first time i would seen a human brain and what she told us was that what she was holding in her hands was the most complex structure known to mankind it is the only structure that can think about itself and one of the most amazing things about the brain is that it can change as a function of the environment it can learn it can grow and i thought that was the coolest thing i would ever heard in my whole life and i did not know it that day but that idea of the brain and its potential and what is called neural plasticity - the ability to change as a function of the environment - was going to become my life\\'s work in science that is what i want to tell you about today so i started out studying a structure in the brain called the hippocampus it is really important for long-term memory but more recently i have become interested in how exercise can actually improve our learning memory and cognition and i got interested in that not because i read a paper or went to a talk i went to the gym when i turned 40, i decided i wanted to get in the best shape of my life and i went to the gym and the class that i found that kept me coming back to the gym on a really regular basis was a class called \"intensati,\" developed by this amazing fitness instructor named patrician more in new york city now intensity is unique because it takes physical movements from kickbox, dance yoga and martial arts but the unique part is that it pairs each physical movement with a positive spoken affirmation what do i mean by that so in intensati, we do not just punch we say i am strong now and the class says it back to you so what happens is that you not only get that great aerobic exercise but because you are speaking out you actually get an increase in aerobic output and it makes you feel great so the bottom line was i got in great shape but there were two amazing benefits that i noticed one was that i had this amazing motivation i felt like a million bucks after i came out of this class and i could not wait to go back and i thought my gosh patrician more is an amazing teacher to instill that kind of motivation and then i thought well wait a second i am a teacher i wonder if my students feel that way after my neuroanatomy class i am going to come back to that in a second the second amazing benefit was that when i went back to work - when i started doing intensity i was writing a lot of grants - and i noticed that as i got more regular with the workouts my writing got easier i was able to make associations better i was able to focus better and i thought this is amazing i want to look at the neuroscience literature to understand what is going on and i looked at the literature - a lot of new studies coming out as well as looking at some of the older studies that had led to our current understanding and when i looked at those i found a very familiar name that name was martian diamond so she was not only my undergraduate advisor but she was a real pioneer in neuroscience research and really only one of the only women working in this field back in the late 1950s and \\'60s, when she discovered that when you raise rats in what she called an enriched environment with lots of toys to play with other rats to play with and they run around a lot and you compared their brains to rats raised in what she called an impoverished environment with no toys just a couple of rats in a small box what you can do is measure their brain you measure actually the thickness of that outer covering of their brain called the cortex and what she found is that the rats raised in enriched environments had cortices that were actually thicker their brain grew as a function of this enriched environment and later studies showed that exercise the increased exercise those rats were getting because they were running around a lot more was a big factor in that brain change so i thought okay this is an area that i really want to get to know and as a professor the best way to get to know topic area is to teach a class so i decided i am going to teach a class at nu called can exercise change your brain and i decided because i got inspired to do this because of exercise i thought would not it be great if i could bring exercise into the classroom and not only teach students about what exercise is doing to their brain but also teach them have them experience what exercise felt like so i thought i could do this so i decided to go to the gym and of course i loved intensati, so i became a certified intensity instructor and a certified fitness instructor i could tell you oh it was so hard i was teaching classes i was writing grants but the truth is it was so much fun it was really fun because i got to learn a whole new way to move a whole new way to motivate students and i stayed in great shape so there was nothing better so i had this class i was teaching i was going to teach an hour of aerobic exercise i trained for six months to be able to teach in front of this class - i had never done this before but i thought it would be fun - so teach an hour of aerobic exercise an hour of intensati, followed by an hour-and-a-half lecture on the effects of exercise in the brain but then i realized i had my first study right there my students could be my subjects in my first study all i had to do was test them cognitively at the beginning at the end of the semester and compare their performance to a class that did not exercise and ask whether in fact exercise could improve their cognitive performance so that is exactly what i did and before i tell you what our prediction was and what our results were i just want to take you back for a moment to september i 2009, which was the first day of this can exercise change your brain class and it is seared in my memory mainly because i was really scared and nervous i give many many lectures i love giving lectures but this one i was very nervous why because my goal was to actually try and inspire these kids to love exercise in the way that patrician more inspired me but also inspire them to love neurobiology and the brain and plasticity the way that martian diamond inspired me so i had a pretty high bar and i was pretty scared to step out in front of that classroom but i have to say i think the students were a bit scared too they would never come to a class where the instructor came in workout clothes they would never sweated in front of their professor and i got a lot of nervous laughter when i told them they were going to have to say positive affirmations not not say yell positive affirmations in class but i have to say it was the most memorable first class i have ever taught the students really got into it okay there was nervous laughter and a lot of giggling but they really got into it they were shouting the affirmations they were really going all out in the workout and the best thing was that motivation and that inspiration oozed over into our academic our lecture part they remained engaged asked lots of questions it was a fantastic first class and a fantastic semester so what did we find so our prediction goes back to that structure that i said was important for long-term memory the hippocampus it goes back to the hippocampus because the hippocampus is one of only two brain structures where new brain cells new neurons are born so you and i have shiny new hippocampus cells being born in our hippocampus but the cool thing is that experimental studies in animals have shown that increased aerobic exercise can actually enhance the birth of those new hippocampus neurons and make them live even longer so our prediction was that this increase in aerobic exercise in my nu students would actually improve their learning and memory improve their ability to learn new pieces of information and improve their ability to retain those new pieces of information did we find that well we tested them on a whole battery of different cognitive tests and what we found was one significant improvement in my class that improvement was in the ability to encode new long-term memories what task was that it was a complicated task it was actually a quite difficult task students were given a really complex geometrical image - it was like an etch-a-sketch image - and then after a delay they would have to discriminate between that etch-a-sketch image and one that looked very very similar to it my students got significantly faster at identifying the correct image that they saw before so they are able to separate out things that are coming in your memory for example you are meeting lots of new people here today and so you might be better if you exercise and come to my class at differentiating between the faces of different people that you meet today so that is a very very useful thing to be able to do so is this new what is new about this well it is new and exciting because - i have to say we are not the only people my lab is not the only lab interested in the effects of exercise but the majority of the work has been done on looking at the effects of exercise in the elderly population why because cognitive decline is a major health issue in the elderly not to even mention alzheimer\\'s disease the exciting news in the elderly population is that increased aerobic exercise has clearly been shown to improve cognition so that is great but the idea there is that there is decline already so you have a little bit of room to see improvement what about my healthy young very smart nu neuroscience majors they are at the peak of their cognitive abilities as are you and i could exercise actually help us our studies suggest that yes they can now we are not only interested in learning memory and cognition but there is a really exciting link to the topic of today\\'s conference that is creativity and that comes from one of the newest directions of study of the hippocampus we have known for a very very long time that exercise can improve - sorry - that the hippocampus is important for long-term memory but recent studies have suggested the hippocampus is also important for creativity and imagination why because patients with hippocampus damage have significant impairments at being able to imagine new situations so we ask a patient with hippocampus damage describe for me a tropical beach scene - they have never been to a tropical beach they can barely say anything about sand or water whereas a control subject would be able to tell you about the white sand and the corona in their left hand with that an umbrella in it all these different details so the idea is the hippocampus is not only important for putting new associations in mind that help you remember the events like this in your past - it will be in your past - but also important for putting new concepts together in unique ways the basis of both creativity and imagination so what we want to do - we have not done this - is to look at the effects of exercise not only on learning and memory but on increased creativity as well so what is the bottom line here the bottom line is simple increased aerobic exercise can improve learning memory and possibly creativity what is more to know and everybody wants a magic pill to get smarter well this is not a pills and it comes with a lot more sweat than a pills but it can help you it is free it helps you every day and our goal over the next ten years is trying to figure out exactly how that is helping you what exactly is changing in the brain so i only have one question for you who wants to go to the gym anybody okay great thank you'}\n"

      "Superar el miedo al fracaso puede ser un desaf√≠o, pero hay maneras poderosas de enfrentar y transformar ese miedo en motivaci√≥n. Aqu√≠ van algunas ideas:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Reconoce tus emociones**: Es normal sentir miedo al fracaso. En lugar de reprimirlo, acepta que es parte del proceso. Hablar de tus miedos, como lo hizo el orador en el contexto, puede ayudarte a crear una conexi√≥n m√°s profunda con tus experiencias.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cambia tu perspectiva**: En lugar de ver el fracaso como un final, m√≠ralo como una oportunidad para aprender y crecer. Cada error trae consigo valiosas lecciones que te hacen m√°s fuerte y m√°s sabio.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Con√©ctate contigo mismo**: Preg√∫ntate qu√© es lo que realmente temes. A veces, el miedo proviene de pensamientos negativos o cr√≠ticas internas. Al igual que el orador se dio cuenta de que su cr√≠tico interno estaba ah√≠ para protegerlo, puedes encontrar el prop√≥sito detr√°s de tus miedos y trabajar en su transformaci√≥n.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Establece expectativas realistas**: En lugar de buscar la perfecci√≥n, establece metas alcanzables. Esto te permitir√° disfrutar del proceso y celebrar tus avances, en lugar de enfocarte solo en el resultado.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Rod√©ate de apoyo**: Con√©ctate con personas que te alienten y te apoyen. Las relaciones positivas pueden ser un gran impulso cuando sientes que el miedo te detiene.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Visualiza el √©xito**: Imagina el resultado positivo que deseas. Esto no solo te ayudar√° a aliviar el miedo, sino que tambi√©n te motivar√° a seguir adelante.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recuerda, ¬°cada paso que tomas hacia adelante, sin importar cu√°n peque√±o sea, es un triunfo! La clave es ser amable contigo mismo y celebrar tu valent√≠a al enfrentar tus miedos. ¬°T√∫ puedes hacerlo!\n",

      "Resultado 1: {'text': \"i have a problem how many times do we say that and we tend to think that it is because we have problems that we struggle in life it is not true if we struggle in life it is because we have parts within ourselves parts who are suffering parts who are afraid and most importantly who believe nothing can be changed this is the reason why we struggle up until a few months ago i thought i had a problem which was that i found it hard to speak about me in public on a personal level but i did oka because as a doctor most often it was related to medical or scientific topics and as a results there was no discomfort until the day i received a call from someone who means a great deal to me and who invited me to talk about my experience on the use of the psychotherapy model which i am introducing to you tonight and that i use at my hospital but he did ask specifically for me to make it personal since it was my experience and i quickly declined his invitation because there was a little voice inside my head telling me you have nothing of interest to say well i thought i was at peace with that but then few weeks or months later that same person calls me up again and again asks for me to present at that time i thought there most certainly was something to unravel here because if this person who means a lot to me asks again for me to come and talk about my experience there is something unfinished about this at first i asked him to give me a little time told him that i needed to think it through and i used this time to look inwards to look inwards to know who was telling me that i had nothing interesting to say to other people on a personal level to do so it is important to take a moment here is how i did it i focused inwards on this voice calmly and in a curious manner who is it at first all i heard was this message you have nothing of interest to say and then as i kept asking i heard something else if this person really knew you he would not ask you to do that he really has no idea who you are you have nothing interesting to say it went on for a while after a while i realized that this voice came from a person a part of me and that this person had all the traits of a critics a judge from within this was an important discovery because i could really become aware of the presence of this person and as a results i could genuinely talk with him ask him questions such as why do you keep on telling me all this why do you have this purpose in my life to criticize me to judge me the way you do what are you afraid of if i did accept the invitation and went to the conference to talk about myself it was really interesting because all of a sudden the tone changed and instead of criticism came something quite moving deep inside i am afraid that you may relive something hard you have experienced before so first i thanked this part for his caring intention and i then asked it know would you agree to step aside and to let me reconnect with this hardship you want to prevent me from reliving he agreed to that and behind this part of me was another part a little boy eight years of age he was standing by the door of the apartment i used to live in at the time he was standing absolutely frozen and he did not know i was there because for all these years the critic was standing between the two of us and so it took a little time for this little boy to realize that i was there and that i was there for him and so we started talking open heatedly i asked him if he would want to tell me about himself his story why he was frozen we took a moment and talked about his suffering his emotions once he turned to me and recognized me and trusted me enough he started explaining to me telling me things things i already knew but he said them again from deep inside his heart told me that he was the youngest of a family who was going through a hard time then with many agencies to deal with and that whenever this little boy wanted to talk about himself there was no room no time for that as a consequences he ended up thinking that what he thought was important to say in his heart was of no interest since nobody cared or so it seemed to him this was an important time because from this moment on he felt completely understood and so i asked him now that he knew i understood him whether he would leave the past behind and be interested to join me in the present whether he was interested in changing his way of life clearly he was and so i told him for this to happen there is something important for you to do it is to get rid of everything linked to this hardship and that still weighs on you he agreed to do so to relieve himself of his burden and to my great surprise i met a bold adventurous little boy very eager to join me and go to this conference once this change had taken place i turned to the critic and asked so how are things for you now do you still need to play this role in my life and once again to my surprise he said no i do not need to anymore i see that you can take care of this boy he is safe now i then asked would you accept to play another part to do something else less difficult less burdening he said woke i will be your adviser now i will assist you so the little boy the adviser and myself got to work we prepared the conference and people quite liked it why did i choose to tell you this story here tonight after all it is a story pertaining to familiar elements being hurt being defensive and maybe one would frown upon such a happy ending still there are key points i want to share with you linked to my own experience both with this little boy but also with the therapy model i came here to tell you about first the importance to meet the parts within ourselves how important this relationship is second why is it stuck inside as a result of what and that not dealing with it will prevent any change thirdly it can change there is a plan be what i did when i looked within was that i connected with it i could have talked to somebody about my problem i even could have mentioned my parts to them but instead i went within myself francs within franchise and connected with these parts first the critics then the boy and this is essential because when a connection is created from within myself changes occur a feeling of security and trust emerges and this allows for an important thing to happen which is for this critic to show himself beyond what he tells me who he truly is his underlying positive intention towards me he wanted to protect me it allows him to take a risk the second thing was why was it all stuck inside why was the boy stuck in the apartment the answer is quite simple it is because of his burden what is his burden it is the suffering which is attached to the hardship and this suffering is still there it was in or on the little boy the little boy was stuck there thinking he was not interesting the problem with the burden and the parts of us bearing it is that these parts absorb it all these parts believe they are the burden itself they forgot that they are merely bearing it they believe they are it and as a results this burden becomes a poison a genuine poison bums in our societies we like them so long as they are far enough from us they are dirty they stink they drink they yell they are unclean and so we tend to stay away from these members of society the same thing happens within ourselves there are parts of ourselves who are not attractive who stink who have experienced such hardships that have come to be unworthy of love because they are not pretty inside and so within ourselves we do the same thing we do with bums we shield ourselves from them and isolate them inside how do we do that well it is quite simple actually there are other parts in us who are quite good at this and create a protective barrier they are called protectors so who are the protectors well they are these parts in us which are linked to our habits our reassuring ways of dealing with things for example taking a little pill before going to bed because it is a little too hard without it or to have a couple of glasses because there is a difficult meeting ahead and we want to be relaxed or this overwhelming urge to succeed in life or to rely on your intellect to understand everything or to do sports because one has to release one's energy somehow and calm one's anxiety all these behaviors which are a little bit over the top which make us feel like we do not really have a choice in the matter these are the protectors within us there are parts within us doing all this and fortunately so because they help us cope with our pain they help prevent us from feeling down and when we feel down because we are in contact with these wounded parts they help us getting away from them because it is just too painful to stay there the problem is that these parts are scared because they know that if they stop what they are doing the fire of pain will rise again in our lives and so this fear prevents them from stopping why well since the wounded parts are convinced that they are their own burden that they are dirty the protective parts have no choice but to protect them and behave in our lives sometimes to extremes even to the point of being destructive either for us or for others this is the first tragedy the second tragedy is that we end up thinking the same thing they do that change is not an option that we are stuck with this forever and that is why it is important to know that there is a plan be plan b is the plan you use whenever what you tried first did not succeed plan a is i am hurt i protect myself plan b is something else it is doing what i did it is going within myself francs within franchise meeting these parts it is important because first it allows for the understanding of the intention the history the pain but mostly it brings security it allows for my protectors your protectors to stand aside enough so that i in a loving way can access these wounded parts and when these parts feel the compassion and love they agree to do what my little boy did which is to release their burden and to come back to their real nature and from then on our protective parts can consider stopping what they do what they are exhausted doing and causes us problems in life this person this francs within francs who could do all this is like a flame inside it is who i really am deep inside of me in the ifs psychotherapy model i am introducing to you tonight the internal family systems model this flame is called the self and i would like to leave you with a message that we share the adviser the little boy and myself this message is that this self is always here no matter what happened to us even the worst situations even in the most chronic situations this flame is always here available as an invitation to our protectors to trust and an invitation to these suffering parts to relieve themselves from their pain an invitation to our parts to relieve themselves from what weighs on them and come back to their true nature thank you\"}\n",

in their experience in their personal experience life is like me versus the universe being in competition with the universe is a stupid thing to do that is not a competition you must get into hello me versus the universe is a bad competition to get into would you also agree with me so this is why yoga yoga yoga does not mean twisting and turning your body the word yoga means union right now it is me versus the universe i this is just your psychological condition this is not the reality even when you feel utterly lonely are you still breathing so you are transacting with the world is not it yes you only cannot get along with the people around you but the atmosphere is okay with you food is okay if it tastes good water is okay you have transaction with the world is not it universe your

universe or the cosmos obviously will feel crushed for small things little things will crush you small things when i say little things i maybe you failed your examination maybe you got thrown out of the university maybe you got fired from a job maybe somebody ditched you maybe something else like this happened these are all small things between life and death because you came here with nothing is

you do you have any proof do you have any proof that you are not already in heaven and messing it up do you have any proof you are already in heaven making a mess out of it yes simply because you are not even learning how to handle your basic faculties of thought and emotions is not it your only justification is everybody is like this only i that is how it is in a madhouse laughs that is how it is

snail appetizer i she said go to the beach and get some snails fresh and i will make some appetizer for all the friends who are coming so shankaran pillar went to the beach and he was picking up all the snails and putting in a bucket then he met an old friend an india guy they hit it off and they were talking about their old times he just forgot that he is married you know when you meet old friends it happens and both of them went to a bar and they had a few drinks and he just forgot then he realized then the snails were just climbing out and take one snail fell out of the bucket he realized oh my god i am supposed to take the snails my wife french wife she is waiting so he said i need to got and he went by then it was already very late he went he knew it is not two fantastic faculties going to be pleasant so he came near the house and spilled all the snails on the ground threw away the bucket and went and knocked on the door the french fury came he turned back and said come on you guys we are almost there come on let us got so when are you going to pick your snails and put them in the bucket and fix them hmm your problems you must fix them is not it these are not problems i want you to understand you are not suffering your life you are only suffering two fantastic faculties it is a privilege of being human that we have these two fantastic faculties.one is we have a vivid sense of memory this is because of this memory our life is so rich unlike any other creature and we have a fantastic sense of imagination now this is what you are suffering what happened

by a stay at a mothering home a daughter who left the hospital before she did a bill for my foster care and ultimately my adoption my father paid penance by working as a bricklayer for a year before he to university in edinburgh they never saw each other again whatever expectations they had were letting go of expectations shattered on top of that they were told that they should be grateful privileged that they had a chance to redeem themselves and move on this is all pretty standard stuff for that time in place and i am telling you this because i want to note that although my parents learned not to expect in the wake of our separation this is not the productive kind of letting go the kind of letting go that they learned is rooted in shame and in punishment there is not any hope in it it is about shutting down and what i would like us to do today is learn how to let go and open up so fast-forward 18 years from that tearful breakup in the garage my adoptive father my dad had made it clear that he would totally understand if i wanted to go and find my natural family this is a lot easier in scotland than it is here they do not alter birth certificates the adoptee has the rights to all the records so i took myself off to the house of records in edinburgh and got hold of my birth certificate it had my birth name my mother's name her then address it took me another 18 years to decide to search the lead up to that would take another tedtalk or two mostly something had shifted inside me on a trip back in 2003 i walked past the house listed on the birth certificate and i just could not let it go after that i was led entirely by my gut i kind of had to be adoptee are less than i of the population only a few of assert and only a fraction of the people who search actually wind up being in reunion there are not enough of us for there to be a guidebook and for me this turned out to be a good thing it did help that i had had my own child my first child in somewhat similar circumstances to my own birth it also helped that i knew two other friends who were adoptee who were in reunion they had gone into the reunion with a litany of expectations one friend was in a relationship with her natural father that could best be termed as clandestine the other friend's father drank himself into ice the first time they met their relationships with all their natural families were fraught to say the least so i went in with an awareness of the letting go of hope risks i looked clearly at the risks and i decided to go ahead i went in also trying to pare back to what i really hoped without the expectation and what i hoped was to find my natural mother i wanted to know where i came from yes part of me did want the opah style reunion you know the one where you go and the whole gigantic attractive successful natural family welcomes the adoptee on whom they have been waiting their whole lives but i did not go expecting it i pared back and back to what was driving the hope i knew i had to hang on to that i knew i had to be whole and i had to expect nothing when i felt ready to do that i contacted birth link in scotland this is a nonprofit agency that helps adoptee and their families connect with each other i put my name on the list for a searcher that takes some months so in the waiting time i searched more deeply within myself i asked myself all kinds of odd questions what would i do if i found my mother and she was dying and needed my help what would i make of it if i found her and she was alcoholic obese if she was destitute a retired prostitute and i realized that anything that would bother me deeply would do so because i already saw it as a weakness in myself in other words anything i might want her to change was really something i wanted to change in myself i believe this is also called owning your own stuff owning your own stuff also talk to my brother he is also adopted and he said look heather the only thing you really have to worry about is if you go to meet her and she comes to the door with her bags packed and goes alright darling we are we going cut she thinks she is moving in with you anything else you can just run away from start is often good for a little bit of comedy with some truth embedded and he was right either one of us could end the relationship at any moment and is not that the case with all our relationships we behave as though in our relationships especially our significant ones we behave as though we are operating with some kind of a relationship union like a pipe fitters union that is going to uphold our expectation contract but the truth is relationships live in a right-to-work state any party and sometimes a third party like sudden death can end the contract with no notice and no cause and that is a scary truth to face but as with any other no guidebook truth all the expectation in the world cannot stop it what i knew what my net natural parents and i had lived for nearly four decades before we came face-to-face is that expectation does not guarantee you a thing so i entered the relationship knowing the risks i entered the relationship owning what i brought i entered the relationship without that guidebook and here's the good thing about there not being a guidebook there are not any articles about what a good reunion looks like like the articles you read that imply that all the other married couples have more sex than you the skinny woman next door eats cherry pie for breakfast the other guy's business makes more money than yours and it is more fun to work there all the things that build up our expectations and they record chances of honoring what is right in front of us so when i entered the relationship in this rest in way what i found that i was able to really rest in and notice small moments and to take joy there i noticed for instance the grain of my mother's freckled hand wrapped around her mug of tea the first time we met i got to experience her with the surest sureness of adulthood and the heart of a child i did not have my expectation checklist running through my head that is what expectations do they tend to run through our head act like a third party in our relationship constantly vying for our attention and that feels okay when things match up but even then we have stepped away from the moment and the relationship to check in with them and when things do not measure up then we really go aside we start talking to expectation asking it for affirmation he should have brought me flowers should not he she should run those meetings on time and our expectation list says oh yes honey you are right get back in there and make them do it your way so you keep asking and asking and getting grumpier and grumpier when things do not measure up if you have asked a couple of times and you have not gotten the response you wanted you are probably not going to get it and in that stepping away to measure up with expectation you have missed the moment and the relationship as it unfolded that might have offered a path forward and even when the worst thing happens when your expectations are not met and another path forward is not on offer you are then resting in the truth and you can choose to move yourself forward from the truth of that relationship in that moment expectation does not stop painful stuff from happening it just blames it on somebody else what expectations do is pull us out of the moment they hold us in an infinite loop of false possibility so i challenge you today to free yourself from this loop of false possibility before you leave this building this afternoon think of one relationship that has one unfulfilled expectation in it let the expectation go search yourself own your stuff commit to entering your next interaction in that relationship without the expectation hanging on to some hope and then just allowing yourself to fully rest in the reality of the moment whatever needs or wants you might have it is possible that those can be met in some other way but not by this person at this moment settle your heart to that and then move yourself forward i think you will find that if you can be brave enough to rest in reality human and flawed and possibly beautiful reality it will take you places better than you have ever dared to expect\"}\n",
      "Resultado 4: {'text': \"i have a confession to make but first i want you to make a little confession to me in the past years i want you to just raise your hand if you have experienced relatively little stress anyone how about a moderate amount of stress who is experienced a lot of stress yeah me too but that is not my confession my confession is this i am a health psychologist and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier but i fear that something i have been teaching for the last 10 years is doing more harm than good and it has to do with stress for years i have been telling people stress makes you sick it increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease basically i have turned stress into the enemy but i have changed my mind about stress and today i want to change yours let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress this study tracked 30,000 adults in the united states for eight years and they started by asking people how much stress have you experienced in the last years they also asked do you believe that stress is harmful for your health and then then they use public death records to find out who died okay some bad news first people who experience a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43 % increased risk of dying but that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health people who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die in fact they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study including people who had relatively little stress now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths 182,000 20,000 america died prematurely not from stress but from the belief that stress is bad for you that is over 20,000 deaths a years now if that estimate is correct that would make believing stress is bad for you the with largest cause of death in the united states last years killing more people than skin cancer hive aids and homicide you can see why the study freaked me out here i have been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health so this study got me wondering can changing how you think about stress make you healthier and here the science says yes when you change your mind about stress you can change your body's response to stress now to explain how this works i want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out it is called the social stress test you come into the laboratory and you are told you have to give a five minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you and to make sure you feel the pressure there are bright lights and a camera in your face like this and the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging nonverbal feedback like this now that you are sufficiently demoralized time for part two a math test and unbeknownst to you the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it now we are going to all do this together it is going to be fun for me okay i want you all to count backwards words from 996 in increments of seven you are going to do this out loud as fast as you can starting with 996. got go faster faster please you are going too slow stop stop stop stop that guy made a mistake we are going to have to start all over again you are not very good at this are you okay so you get the idea now if you were actually in this study you would probably be a little stressed out your heart might be pounding you might be breathing fast or maybe breaking out into a sweat and normally we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we are not coping very well with the pressure but what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized was preparing you to meet this challenge now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at hazard university before they went through the social stress test they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful that pounding heart is preparing you for action if you are breathing faster it is no problem it is getting more oxygen to your brain and participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance well they were less stressed out less anxious more confident but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed now in a typical stress response your heart rate goes up and your blood vessels constrict like this and this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease it is not really healthy to be in this state all the time but in the study when participants view their stress response as helpful their blood vessel stayed relaxed like this their heart was still pounding but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile it actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage over a lifetime of stressful experiences this one biological change could be the difference between a stress'-induced heart attack at age 50 and living well into your 90s. and this is really what the new science of stress reveals that how you think about stress matters so my goal as a health psychologist has changed i no longer want to get rid of your stress i want to make you better at stress and we just did a little intervention if you raise your hand and said you would had a lot of stress in the last years we could have saved your life because hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress you are going to remember this talk and you are going to think to yourself this is my body helping me rise to this challenge and when you view stress in that way your body believes you and your stress response becomes healthier so now i said i have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from so we are going to do one more intervention i want to tell you about one of the most underappreciated aspects of the stress response and the idea is this stress makes you social to understand the side of stress we need to talk about a hormones oxytocin and i know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get it even has its own cute nickname the cuddle hormones because it is released when you hug someone but this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in oxytocin is a neurohormone. it fine'-tunes your brain's social instinct it primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family it enhances your empathy it even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin to become more compassionate and caring but here's what most people do not understand about oxytocin it is a stress hormones your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response it is as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pounds and when oxytocin is released in the stress response it is motivating you to seek support your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel instead of bottling it up your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other when life is difficult your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you okay so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier well oxytocin does not only act on your brain it also acts on your body and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress it is a natural anti'-inflammatory. it also helps your blood vessel stay relaxed during stress but my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart your heart has receptors for this hormones and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate and heal from any stress'-induced damage this stress hormone strengthens your heart and the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support so when you reach out to others under stress either to seek support or to help someone else you release more of this hormones your stress response becomes healthier and you actually recover faster from stress i find this amazing that your stress response has a built'-in mechanism for stress resilience and that mechanism is human connection i want to finish by telling you about one more study and listen up because this study could also save a life this study tracked about a thousand adults in the united states and they ranged in age from 34 to 93. and they started the study by asking how much stress have you experienced in the last years they also asked how much time have you spent helping out friends neighbors people in your community and then they use public records for the next five years to find out who died okay so the bad news first for every major stressful life experience like financial difficulties or family crisis that increased the risk of dying by 30 i but and i hope you are expecting a but by now but that was not true for everyone people who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress'-related increase in dying zero caring created resilience and so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not inevitable how you think and how you act can transform your experience of stress when you choose to view your stress response as helpful you create the biology of courage and when you choose to connect with others under stress you can create resilience now i would not necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life but this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress stress gives us access to our hearts the compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connecting with others and yes your pounding physical heart working so hard to give you strength and energy and when you choose to view stress in this way you are not just getting better at stress you are actually making a pretty profound statement you are saying that you can trust yourself to handle life's challenges and you are remembering that you do not have to face them alone thank you thank you this is amazing what you are telling us it seems amazing to me that a belief about stress can make so much difference to someone's life expectancy how would that extend to send to advice if someone's making a lifestyle choice between say a stressful job and a non'-stressful job does it matter which way they got that it is equally wise to go for the stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it in some sense yeah and one thing we know for certain is that chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort and so i would say that is really the best way to make decisions is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows.thank. you so much kelly.thank you that is really cool\"}\n",
      "Resultado 5: {'text': \"early in my life i learned that there was one thing that could kill a festive mood at a dinner party and that was to talk about me to talk about my life my life as the daughter of a cult leader there was very little that was joking or lighthearted about the first 28 years of my life so i avoided that topic at all costs it was too painful nobody could understand so i became a master at diverting attention at during the conversation on to somebody else but not me i so rarely talked about my life that on the rare occasion when i would slip and somebody would kind of push for me to divulge i could not just casually and comfortably share it i would bond with the story and it would go something like this well i grew up outside of chico and my dad pastured actually a wonderful church there that through the years evolved into a 15,000 member cult it operated and it still operates under the guise of an independent fundamental baptist church but those who have left the followers have tried to leave outsiders even the media it was on 20/20 last year recognize that it is clearly a cult every member was in complete obedience father they did not dare disagree or be disloyal for fear of being publicly ridiculed or punished or banished for doing so they did not go on a vacation without asking my dad's permission and he had said they drink the kool-aid i am not kidding they would have my dad lived a double life one of righteous family man and dynamic speaker in the public eye but one of sordid sexual secrets privately secrets that only my siblings and me and my mom knew he hated my mom hated her treated her terribly abused her and even turned his own children against our mother we hated her he told us she was crazy we thought to make him happy we would hate her too our home was felt full of turmoil hatred stress strife and as a little girl it was isolating it was intense and it was frightening he had affairs had a mistress for many years the wife of a sunday-school teacher built her family a beautiful home right around the corner from our house you could see their family from our back door it was it was craziness living one way preaching another my brother my older brother he became another version of my father he took a he pastured a church in texts was found to have been having affairs with 14 different women divorced that current wife married one of the 14 my father tried desperately to cover it up moved into another church where he was found to have had 17 there was with different women and he just recreated what he had seen my dad with and my dad did nothing but cover it up i felt like i had one main responsibility as a child it was simple but daunting and that was to keep all the secrets there were so many you see he had taught us that the best way to please god was to please him because he was god's man and he taught us that to please him we had to keep all the secrets we could not even tell our best friends what went on in our home because we might be the causes for the destruction of his ministry i literally feared my very life if i ever talked about my dad's ministry but what went on in our home for fear that it would hurt his ministry i was so afraid and the greater the secrets the greater the fear and the greed of my determination to keep quiet i gotta tell you the money part of it was pretty nice as a kid i mean think about it tithes and offerings from 50,000 people know it created a lavish lifestyle for our family my father owned most of the city where the church was he owned to college to high schools to great schools a cemetery blocks of buildings he was very wealthy and even into our adult years he owned us he owned our homes our cars our furniture he owned our lives and we did not dare cross him because we were to her whose everything he died a multimillionaire he left nothing to his children he left everything to the organization which my younger sister and her husband now need and they still perpetuate his legacy the strict rules the undying loyalty and they still try to keep all the secrets i never understood why was i the only one that the four kids so tortured by the hypocrisy so disturbed by the mind control over thousands and thousands of people and so determined to find a better life why was i the only one that insisted on answers to my questions and why was i the only one that ultimately broke away and cut ties with the brainwashing the oppression the fear the secrets and the life that had never been my life i finally walked away when i was about 28 years of age then being estranged from my entire family and i did not see my family again until many years later at my dad's funeral okay see what i mean not a story to share at a dinner party i really got to the point after i left dinner that i could not talk about me for one thing who would understand for another thing it was too hard it hurt too bad so i made a mental note and permanent marker that said must never talk about my life and for many years i did not i could not however wonderful things had happened through the years since their therapy a lot of therapy deprogramming freedom from the mind control and i began to heal and learn and accept and forgive and even learn to be thankful that bizarre life that i had because i realized i was learning some amazing lessons from not only being there but from having the guts to leave and i now have values that are deeply carved in my very soul from that instead of these you do not get for reading a book or from a workshop or another person bellies that are only this deeply ingrained when you live what i live because my dad was a cult leader i now embrace three values and no one will ever take these away from me the first one is freedom to explore my own interests freedom to live within my own value system freedom to determine my own value system freedom to believe what i believe and never stifle what i believe freedom to disagree for you to ask questions and require honest answers freedom to learn who i am and freedom to love who i am the second value was truth i learned pretty quickly that i was not going to be very free until i dealt with what was true and that was hard for me truth was a scary word for me because i mean my entire life i had never been allowed to speak of what went on in our home i had never told even my best friends what went on in our house being truthful was one of the scariest things i could think of i learned that secrets grown in the dark but when exposed to the light of truth they start to lose their power many person my dear amazing therapist in callas texts who nurtured me and who loved me through years and years of healing she used to say to me kinda you are only as sick as your secrets you are only as sick as your secrets so i stopped keeping secrets and as scared as i was in my late is i finally began to deal with what was true i think it finally began to speak what was true and eventually learned how to live openly only in truth and the third value is courage did you know that you actually cannot have freedom or truth if you have no courage is a requirement for both you may desire to live in complete free and the complete truth but if you are lacking and courage you will live in neither one in my late is i had a tiny shred of courage not much but it was all i needed because my desire to live and be free and honest was somewhat great but that teeny shred of courage that i had was enough to allow me to walk away i have a plaque on my desk that i have had for years and it is gone with me everywhere i have ever moved it says the secret to happiness is freedom and the secrets of freedom is courage and that resonated with me i knew it was not going to be happy unless i was free but i knew i was not going to be free my second some courage to get out of there i had to cling to and act upon that tiny shred of courage in order to finally leave a cult the only friends i never know my childhood connections my history my family knowing that in doing so i finally have what i had longed for my entire life and that was freedom true freedom truth courage three words that maybe kind of trite and overused to some people to me they are the air that i breathe values upon which i insist on living and loving in my life oh and one other thing i actually know about you sharing my story talking about me i now recognize that it is in sharing my story and i can so passionately share with you my values gained over 28 years not an emotional prison that kept my heart under lock and key and kept my mind for knowing what i knew you know i sometimes wonder if perhaps living in the absence of our values is what can most clearly determine what indeed our values are and for me i really believe that the apes and the denial of created the presence of for so many years i was denied freedom truth and courage and now i will never let them go not to worry you are still not going to find me at a dinner party he is talking about my childhood not going to happen you will not find me sitting around elaborating over my father who took a wonderful church and turn it into a fifty thousand member cult i still know that is a mood killer i get it but you will find me here and in other appropriate settings especially if i can help somebody talking about my life with sincere gratitude for all that i have learned in spite of and because of living in the absence of freedom truth and courage and thank god i now have by now you\"}\n"

recent survey of millennial asking them what their most important life goals were and over 80 % said that a major life goal for them was to get rich and another 50 % of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous and we are constantly told to lean in to work to push harder and achieve more we are given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them those pictures are almost impossible to get most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but 2020. we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative but what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study many people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy we did that the hazard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that is ever been done for 75 years we have tracked the lives of 724 men year after years asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball further down the field but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived about 60 of our original 724 men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s. and we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men and i am the fourth director of the study since 1938, we have tracked the lives of two groups of men the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at hazard college they all finished college during world war i and then most went off to serve in the war and the second group that we have followed was a group of boys from button's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boson of the 1930s. most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed they were given medical exams we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top and some made that journey in the opposite direction the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today 75 years later telling you that the study still continues every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives many of the inner city boson men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just is not that interesting the hazard men never ask that question to get the clearest picture of these lives we do not just send them questionnaires we interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records from their doctors we draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said it is about time so what have we learned what are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we have generated on these lives well the lessons are not about wealth or fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get from this 75 year study is this good relationships keep us happier and healthier period we have learned three big lessons about relationships the first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier they are physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five america will report that they are lonely and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that it is not just the number of friends you have and it is not whether or not you are in a committed relationship but it is the quality of your close relationships that matters it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health high conflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective once we had followed our men all all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who was not and when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it was not their middle'-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old it was how satisfied they were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men and women reported in their is that on the days when they had more physical pain their moods stayed just as happy but the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain and the third big lesson that we learn about relationships on our health is that good relationships do not just protect our bodies they protect our brains it turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your is is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those people's memories stay sharper longer and the people in relationships where they feel they really cannot count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier memory decline and those good relationships they do not have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments did not take a toll on their memories so this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well'-being, this is wisdom that is as old as the hills why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore well we are human what we would really like is a quick fix something we can get that will make our lives good and keep them that way relationships are messy and they are complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends that is not sexy or glamorous it is also lifelong it never ends the people in our 75'-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates just like the millennial in that recent survey many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life but over and over over these 75 years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let us say you are 25 or you are 40 or you are 60. what might leaning into relationships even look like well the possibilities are practically endless it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member who you have not spoken to in years because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges i would like to close with a quote from mark twain more than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this there is not time so brief is life for bickering apologies heart burnings callings to account there is only time for loving but an instant so to speak for that the good life is built with good relationships thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 2: {'text': \"they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions but let us be honest do we really want to live in a world where we no longer maintain good intentions despite how negative and polarizing the world may seem at times many of us are still doing our best to maintain good intentions and positive interactions with each other and yet it can be frustrating sometimes to discover that something that we have said or done was still experienced by someone else as being offensive in response to this it is easy to get stuck in unhealthy extreme reactions such as strongly defending our character from perceived attacks only to realize that we have invalidated someone ease's feelings as a results or maybe we walk on eggshells or jump through every hoop possible to avoid offending anyone only to shame ourselves for making any mistakes or blame others for being too sensitive or maybe we just give up altogether concluding that you know you just cannot make anybody happy these days so why even try i do not know about you but that makes me scared because i do not know how we can maintain good intentions and positive interactions with each other if we are still going around living in fear of even unintentional offenses however i believe there is another way with your help i believe that we can maintain good intentions avoid the shame and blame game and even strengthen interactions with those who we encounter on a regular basis if that is of interest to you then i invite you to join me in learning to accept the inevitability of offense let me explain during my 20-plus years as a marriage and family therapist i have considered it an honor to be welcomed into the emotionally vulnerable spaces of new and seasoned couples through a variety of life circumstances and challenges during that time i have gained a great appreciation for four relationships strengthening principles that have helped not only the couples who i serve but also individual personal and professional relationships in all walks of life this first relationship-strengthening principle comes to life for me during one of my greatest professional joys which is when premarital engaged couples come into my office with a big smile on their face expressing how confident they are that they have found the one who they are to spend the rest of their life with primarily because they never disagree or argue with each other.(laughter) that is when i get a big smile on my face and i say that is awesome you guys are in the right place because i can help you fix that laughter they get confused just like that and they say wait what you want us to argue and fight with each other i reassuringly say not not but i do want you to know that you can disagree with each other and still love each other you can misunderstand each other and not conclude that maybe we were not meant to be for end the relationship prematurely due to seemingly irreconcilable offenses you see no matter how hard you try you will we will all offend someone at some point in time in our lives you know how i know because there is no absolute list of what is offensive and what is not what is offensive changes over time what is offensive to one person is perfectly fine to the next after all you cannot tell someone what they should be offended by and what they should not not only that but what is offensive is not always about an absolute list of right or wrongs but more often something that was said or done that reminds someone of a past hurt and makes them fear that future harm is on the way as a results if you find out that you have unintentionally offended someone i encourage you to resist the temptation to get stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense instead accept the inevitability of offense take the time to learn what made that offensive to the person in front of you and then make every reasonable effort to reduce the likelihood of repeating that offense moving forward the second relationship-strengthening principle that comes to life for me often does so when i see couples believing that if you do not know me by now you will never never know me laughter as if to convey that if you do not instantly understand and know everything about me then you must not truly love me but in reality i found that some of the best and long-lasting couple relationships are the ones that embrace not knowing everything that there is to know about a person instantly but actually appreciate the opportunity to keep the relationship fresh by learning new things about each other for years to come similarly in your personal and professional relationships i encourage you to acknowledge that you cannot know everything there is to know about everyone all the time or put more simply i encourage you to accept the inevitability of ignorance now i do not know about you but i grew up with ignorance as an insult synonymous with lack of intelligence but in reality ignorance is merely the lack of knowledge and if we are honest we all lack knowledge about a variety of different life circumstances including the things that many people find offensive however i do fair warn you if you are informed that you have unintentionally offended someone and the first thing out of your mouth is the justification for how you did not know that it was offensive it is emotionally reasonable for someone else to respond in frustration how could you not know everybody knows that that is offensive except there is nothing that everyone knows not only that but how did you not know that it was offensive maybe you were never taught by someone important to you that it was offensive maybe you never personally experienced the hurt that would have taught you that was offensive maybe you were never surrounded by people who experienced the hurt that would have taught you by witnessing that it was offensive how could you not know or how could you also know what makes this not just another insensitive defensive excuse is that we can learn to accept the inevitability of ignorance as a temporary state turning that accusation into an opportunity to reduce our ignorance by increasing our knowledge and using that knowledge to reduce the likelihood of the next offense moving forward the third relationship-strengthening principle comes to life for me when i see couples stuck in the reasonable yet futile search for perfect communication for while healthy communication is essential to a good relationship it is also perfectly reasonable for partners to use the same words but mean completely different things based on their family of origin and life experiences even before meeting each other this often results in partners getting stuck in a defensive battle protecting themselves from perceived threats that were never really attacks in the first place but unhealthily expressed pleas for understanding support and empathy similarly in your personal and professional relationships i encourage you to learn to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding for even our reasonable intentions can result in unintentionally negative impacts leading others to feel the need to protect themselves from us as a perceived threat but wait a minutes why would you be a perceived threat if all you have is good intentions well consider this for a moment consider the possibility that before their encounter with you they experienced nine times of someone else saying the exact same thing or doing the exact same thing that you did but after each of those times it was followed by a hurtful experience then you come along the tenth person to do or say that exact thing despite your reasonable intentions it is also reasonable for them to see the pattern and to fear similar harm from you it is because of this that if you find out that you have unintentionally offended someone i encourage you to resist the temptation of getting stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense and instead ask yourself am i really being attacked or have i simply reminded them of a past hurt and made them fear the future harm is on the way if that is even a remote possibility in your life i encourage you to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding and channel your efforts into the fourth relationship-strengthening strategy which is to learn to reassure the hurt person that you are not the threats that they fear that you are you see when my couples get stuck in a defensive battle protecting themselves from perceived threats and misrepresentations what turns things around is not more explanations and justifications it is instead when one or both partners can get to the point of saying i see better than i did before your past hurts i see the impact that they have had on your current unmet needs and i want to come alongside of you to help make your future better than your hurtful past similarly in your personal and professional relationships i encourage you to look for opportunities to reassure a hurt person that you are not the threat that they fear that you are how can you do this well it can start with a verbal acknowledgment of the limitations of your intentions recognizing that your intent does not always determine your impact but some of you even here may actually resent intentions but i find that many people do not actually resent intentions because they actually have a problem with good intentions but more often because people have received the gift of good intentions being offered instead of what they really need changed behavior you can separate yourself from these experiences by making sure that your verbal acknowledgment of reassurance is always followed by a meaningful behavioral change showing that your commitment is more than just words but action showing to make their future better than their hurtful past now i am not really here to tell you one more thing that you should already be doing but might not be doing not i am here to tell you what the next person who you unintentionally offend needs you to do they need you to accept the inevitability of offense getting stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense does less to help that person than your efforts to reduce the likelihood of the next offense they need you to accept the inevitability of ignorance you do not need to know everything about everyone all the time but you can accept what you do not know value what you do know and learn more one experience at a time they need you to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding acknowledging that your intent does not always determine your impact and they need you to reassure hurt persons that you are not the threat that they fear that you are you can do this with flexibility and openness to change but not change out of correction for being a bad person but change out of consideration for the welling of someone else you never know you might be the one in your environment to reduce the likelihood of the next misunderstanding-influenced divorce friendship breakup job resignation or even cultural cancellation all often influenced by unintentional offenses and just like my couples i want you to know that you do not have to live in fear of even unintentional offenses instead you can accept the inevitability of offense make every reasonable effort to reduce the frequency of those offenses and move forward repairing and strengthening every relationship you encounter thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 3: {'text': \"early in my life i learned that there was one thing that could kill a festive mood at a dinner party and that was to talk about me to talk about my life my life as the daughter of a cult leader there was very little that was joking or lighthearted about the first 28 years of my life so i avoided that topic at all costs it was too painful nobody could understand so i became a master at diverting attention at during the conversation on to somebody else but not me i so rarely talked about my life that on the rare occasion when i would slip and somebody would kind of push for me to divulge i could not just casually and comfortably share it i would bond with the story and it would go something like this well i grew up outside of chico and my dad pastured actually a wonderful church there that through the years evolved into a 15,000 member cult it operated and it still operates under the guise of an independent fundamental baptist church but those who have left the followers have tried to leave outsiders even the media it was on 20/20 last year recognize that it is clearly a cult every member was in complete obedience father they did not dare disagree or be disloyal for fear of being publicly ridiculed or punished or banished for doing so they did not go on a vacation without asking my dad's permission and he had said they drink the kool-aid i am not kidding they would have my dad lived a double life one of righteous family man and dynamic speaker in the public eye but one of sordid sexual secrets privately secrets that only my siblings and me and my mom knew he hated my mom hated her treated her terribly abused her and even turned his own children against our mother we hated her he told us she was crazy we thought to make him happy we would hate her too our home was felt full of turmoil hatred stress strife and as a little girl it was isolating it was intense and it was frightening he had affairs had a mistress for many years the wife of a sunday-school teacher built her family a beautiful home right around the corner from our house you could see their family from our back door it was it was craziness living one way preaching another my brother my older brother he became another version of my father he took a he pastured a church in texts was found to have been having affairs with 14 different women divorced that current wife married one of the 14 my father tried desperately to cover it up moved into another church where he was found to have had 17 there was with different women and he just recreated what he had seen my dad with and my dad did nothing but cover it up i felt like i had one main responsibility as a child it was simple but daunting and that was to keep all the secrets there were so many you see he had taught us that the best way to please god was to please him because he was god's man and he taught us that to please him we had to keep all the secrets we could not even tell our best friends what went on in our home because we might be the causes for the destruction of his ministry i literally feared my very life if i ever talked about my dad's ministry but what went on in our home for fear that it would hurt his ministry i was so afraid and the greater the secrets the greater the fear and the greed of my determination to keep quiet i gotta tell you the money part of it was pretty nice as a kid i mean think about it tithes and offerings from 50,000 people know it created a lavish lifestyle for our family my father owned most of the city where the church was he owned to college to high schools to great schools a cemetery blocks of buildings he was very wealthy and even into our adult years he owned us he owned our homes our cars our furniture he owned our lives and we did not dare cross him because we were to her whose everything he died a multimillionaire he left nothing to his children he left everything to the organization which my younger sister and her husband now need and they still perpetuate his legacy the strict rules the undying loyalty and they still try to keep all the secrets i never understood why was i the only one that the four kids so tortured by the hypocrisy so disturbed by the mind control over thousands and thousands of people and so determined to find a better life why was i the only one that insisted on answers to my questions and why was i the only one that ultimately broke away and cut ties with the brainwashing the oppression the fear the secrets and the life that had never been my life i finally walked away when i was about 28 years of age then being estranged from my entire family and i did not see my family again until many years later at my dad's funeral okay see what i mean not a story to share at a dinner party i really got to the point after i left dinner that i could not talk about me for one thing who would understand for another thing it was too hard it hurt too bad so i made a mental note and permanent marker that said must never talk about my life and for many years i did not i could not however wonderful things had happened through the years since their therapy a lot of therapy deprogramming freedom from the mind control and i began to heal and learn and accept and forgive and even learn to be thankful that bizarre life that i had because i realized i was learning some amazing lessons from not only being there but from having the guts to leave and i now have values that are deeply carved in my very soul from that instead of these you do not get for reading a book or from a workshop or another person bellies that are only this deeply ingrained when you live what i live because my dad was a cult leader i now embrace three values and no one will ever take these away from me the first one is freedom to explore my own interests freedom to live within my own value system freedom to determine my own value system freedom to believe what i believe and never stifle what i believe freedom to disagree for you to ask questions and require honest answers freedom to learn who i am and freedom to love who i am the second value was truth i learned pretty quickly that i was not going to be very free until i dealt with what was true and that was hard for me truth was a scary word for me because i mean my entire life i had never been allowed to speak of what went on in our home i had never told even my best friends what went on in our house being truthful was one of the scariest things i could think of i learned that secrets grown in the dark but when exposed to the light of truth they start to lose their power many person my dear amazing therapist in callas texts who nurtured me and who loved me through years and years of healing she used to say to me kinda you are only as sick as your secrets you are only as sick as your secrets so i stopped keeping secrets and as scared as i was in my late is i finally began to deal with what was true i think it finally began to speak what was true and eventually learned how to live openly only in truth and the third value is courage did you know that you actually cannot have freedom or truth if you have no courage is a requirement for both you may desire to live in complete free and the complete truth but if you are lacking and courage you will live in neither one in my late is i had a tiny shred of courage not much but it was all i needed because my desire to live and be free and honest was somewhat great but that teeny shred of courage that i had was enough to allow me to walk away i have a plaque on my desk that i have had for years and it is gone with me everywhere i have ever moved it says the secret to happiness is freedom and the secrets of freedom is courage and that resonated with me i knew it was not going to be happy unless i was free but i knew i was not going to be free my second some courage to get out of there i had to cling to and act upon that tiny shred of courage in order to finally leave a cult the only friends i never know my childhood connections my history my family knowing that in doing so i finally have what i had longed for my entire life and that was freedom true freedom truth courage three words that maybe kind of trite and overused to some people to me they are the air that i breathe values upon which i insist on living and loving in my life oh and one other thing i actually know about you sharing my story talking about me i now recognize that it is in sharing my story and i can so passionately share with you my values gained over 28 years not an emotional prison that kept my heart under lock and key and kept my mind for knowing what i knew you know i sometimes wonder if perhaps living in the absence of our values is what can most clearly determine what indeed our values are and for me i really believe that the apes and the denial of created the presence of for so many years i was denied freedom truth and courage and now i will never let them go not to worry you are still not going to find me at a dinner party he is talking about my childhood not going to happen you will not find me sitting around elaborating over my father who took a wonderful church and turn it into a fifty thousand member cult i still know that is a mood killer i get it but you will find me here and in other appropriate settings especially if i can help somebody talking about my life with sincere gratitude for all that i have learned in spite of and because of living in the absence of freedom truth and courage and thank god i now have by now you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 4: {'text': \"good morning how are you all i see you are calm i will try to share some tools that as marital said i have been with my company of ecological products for almost 20 years it has allowed me to develop professionally today it is the company that allows us all to live beyond the fact that we have also ventured into other alternative businesses during this time all those alternative businesses generally i do not remember any that turned out well the truth is that these things one tries to do sometimes end in some failures some losses and some bad moments but i like to start this way because if not one always talks only about the good parts of the story and if there is something we have all experienced it is that we learn much more from failures and mistakes than from the things that go well the truth is that it has to do with everything as many of the previous speakers have said we should not be afraid of failures they are just another part of life another part of work well basically i want to share some small tools that have helped me both at work and in some parts of life as well we try to organize and generate some organizational tools which we will be discussing but above all i want to share that i had the opportunity or rather the intention because i had the opportunity but i had the intention to study at the university i graduated as an enologist at an agricultural college which functioned in this great building and when one leaves these traditional tools those that we all know like primary school secondary school university master's degrees languages we sometimes realize that they are not enough when we enter the labor field we see that all these tools are very good very positive but they are not enough so my idea is to share some tools that i found more practical and that can help us tools that can help us to develop a business a life many things that we will be discussing and that will help us as we said all these tools are very good but we see that they are not enough so to organize this i want to make a small analogy of work or life in general with a journey what does this have to do with well we all have to be clear about many things whether the journey is short or long it does not matter we have to know where we are starting from what tools we have for the journey and we need to have a goal where we want to got many things may seem obvious and some speakers have already mentioned them but you will see that these obvious things are not always put into practice when it is time to act for example we need to know where we are where we want to got and how we plan for it for instance how do we plan for monday, how do we start monday, do we have it programmed analyzed and know what we will do this extends into the week the months the years our personal goals our work goals so i insist a lot on making the first analysis knowing exactly our starting point from there obviously the tools we need for the journey will emerge the tools we need to develop ourselves while all these traditional tools are good suddenly we can find many other tools in life that will help us progress one of the main tools is observing observe what observe the people around you to copy what they are doing well to take what you like from them and improve it adapt it to yourself these are all small things that will make us better and make things simpler and better the truth is that if you look around you will find a lot of people from parents friends colleagues all of them have something positive absolutely always you can learn something from them so it is very important to be an observer not just to see but to observe to copy and take the positive aspects also it is important to realize that we cannot surround ourselves with just anyone it may seem obvious but the truth is it is crucial to get closer to people who bring something positive who help us grow who complement us and distance ourselves from those who are negative who do not help who do not contribute make a small analysis of the people around you and you will see that by thinking positively there are many things you can learn and that you have not even noticed yet another typical thing especially as one starts to develop and grow is losing priorities it is fundamental to set priorities we all know examples the typical one who starts to do well and the first thing they do is buy a better care instead of capitalizing on their work it is important to have clear priorities and not lose them as we progress as the situation improves we must capitalize on our achievements and not rush into things another important thing is setting rules we all know we live in a country with many rules or at least many illogical rules but no one forces us to be stuck in that situation we can set our personal rules for example as the owner of my company i never do what i want i do not do what is best for me i do what is best for everyone this is a way of setting rules in the personal sphere in the business sphere we have certifications for several years we have had is certifications for commercialization and they help us stay organized and maintain a work line in a country that sometimes does not help in this sense instead of lamenting we can generate our own rules talking about travel there are many young people here i had the opportunity to play rugby and i got the chance to play in australia for a years and in italy for two years traveling is not easy today but there are endless opportunities and it is worth trying traveling generates personal growth and life experience that you cannot learn elsewhere it is a great way to learn languages and cultures if you get the chance choose wisely direct your efforts to places where you can gain the most like learning a new language finally having clear goals and dreams is essential it is crucial to have a great dream that motivates you no matter how big or small being convinced and determined will give you the strength to reach your goals with determination you can achieve whatever you want that is all thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 5: {'text': 'good morning how are you all i see you are calm i will try to tell you how i have done over the years to learn to i do not know if i learned but at least i keep trying to deal with difficult people today i was thinking that it is been almost 20 years i will turn 20 years since my first lesson on how to deal with difficult people remember 15, 1993. you might say why does he remember that date because i got married on remember 30, 1993. it is a date a milestone date in people\\'s lives and 15 days before going to the altar i realized that i could not deal with difficult people i got angry one day at my job i got very angry at my job and 15 days before getting married being a tremendous poor person at that time i was poorer than i am now i decided not to go back to my job i got so angry that i did not go back anymore i had a boss named don alfredo, who is now with his feet forward unfortunately i say unfortunately because i would have preferred to continue learning from him he was a very when i say very i mean very difficult person so i got so angry that i took an attitude an attitude that was the beginning of my learning at that time i learned something that someone later put a label on and said that is the triad of attitude where you went through you chose or in that case i chose to leave my job and i say why i chose that attitude to do that because i felt that person don alfredo, disrespected me i felt pride impotence fear anger i felt that but from where did it start that i thought that man was wrong i thought he was xu and for me he was ya i thought he had different reasons and those reasons were not equitable they were not fair and i was wrong so what did i learn this thing about the triad of attitude we do things because we have felt something but at the same time that feeling has been thought by us and this is basic the first principle of what i want to leave you no one no one no one can make life impossible for someone unless you want it if i had learned this on remember 15, 1993, of course i would have gotten married anyway but very likely i would not have had to give so many explanations before my wedding imagine during the wedding and the honeymoon i will not even tell you no one understood how a guy 15 days before getting married could do such a thing because i thought something i felt something about that person and at that moment and i acted accordingly no one absolutely no one can make our life impossible unless we want it why because we act based on what we think and feel if i tell you you go home and you are parents and a child opens the door or a siblings and says dad it is good that you came i am hungry dad i have no food dad and then you go to the fridge open the fridge it is empty you put your hand in your pocket and say wow i did not bring any money but we are hungry dad tell me if any of you did not feel something here inside based on where i take you you think feel and based on what you feel you act so when i am clear that no one can make my life impossible unless i want it it is easy to understand why we can somehow handle that situation we can hardly change people we cannot yet maybe technology will allow it in the future but today we cannot today we can make a decision i cannot change people i cannot remove a bad thought or eliminate a bad thought it is very difficult and listen to me it is very difficult to remove a bad thought it is very difficult about something or someone what is easy very easy is to change it when you go to a gym and train one two three four times a week your muscles grow the same thing happens with our way of thinking if we train ourselves to think positively our thinking muscle or capacity to think grows if we think well we feel well and we act well so what ends up happening is that very few people can influence our lives i say my life is like a movie and i see it like a movie i have to live it like a movie and i say in my life there is this protagonist i am a protagonist of my life and i am sure that in your lives each one of you is a protagonist there are also supporting actors guest actors extras and also villains difficult people the villains are also good to have in our lives because they teach us to grow they teach us techniques to deal with them they help us push our limits and see how we react to those limits i cannot conceive a life without villains it would be extremely boring imagine a life without someone making your life impossible so sometimes i ask people who is difficult and they say for me my life is full of them like 30.\" oh my then who is the difficult one them or you when we have to deal with difficult people i say we have many options and one technique i have learned i learned from kids i have children one 16, one 13, at some point they were little 4 or 5 years old since i do not have siblings i did not have nephews so i learned from them i am talking about 14 years ago i learned this that my kids were smarter than me in dealing with difficult people when uncle forge came an uncle they never liked i do not know if they did not like him they did not have a feeling for uncle forget uncle forge arrived and the kids left i said wow you do not need to go to harvard.\" now that it is trendy you do not need to go to harvard, just watch the kids you have at home my kids taught me about children wisdom if there are difficult people do what kids do leave and the problem is solved adults complicate things you meet a difficult person and you are like let us see let us see what this person did to me yeah i will cross paths with them they bother me i will bother them that is what adults do kids children wisdom they leave so we somehow have to learn that children wisdom is a resource for dealing with difficult people and you know from another person i learned a lot from and have had close since 1988, that is why i say it is been a long time i think i have been preparing this talk since then since 1988, in august 1988, i met my wife and my wife is passionate about dealing with people with problems language problems since i met her she comes home every day and tells me with more frequency and intensity you know i see that people and kids she works with kids with language problems they have problems because their families have difficult contexts divorced parents parents who fight siblings who do not talk family breakdown and she tells me this every day not just because she has cases like this but because she has a lot of them so what did i learn another thing i learned i learned from my wife i did not have to go anywhere else i learned that behind every difficult person there is a difficult story and be careful you have to uncover those stories how am i going to deal with a difficult person if i do not know why they are difficult people are rarely difficult they are having a difficult time something happened that day that changed their state of mind their emotions behind every difficult person there is a difficult story think about it when you come home at night hungry imagine me a good eater after a long day without eating how do you think i get home like a difficult person but what is behind this difficult person a difficult story 12 hours of work little time for lunch inadequate refreshments so what ends up happening is that even physiologically we have problems that turn us into difficult people not just for us but for others so it is important for you to review that behind every difficult person there is a difficult story unfortunately families break more and more the family institution breaks down and that creates difficult stories so i believe we will increasingly have to learn how to deal with difficult people i do not have any secrets but i have one very important one i believe we must carry a little package of affection care love in our pockets why because difficult people need to be treated with care think about jess wow when jess chose the apostles he did not choose the best from the town that is a lie he chose tough guys but what did he do he accepted them and loved them as they were and then he could help them and they helped think about it since then people used affection pills i cannot think of changing someone if i do not accept and love them as they are if i enter that path i will not achieve anything if i follow the path of not caring about people not caring about those who do not serve me i will not achieve anything i am not talking about work or family i am talking about life in general in any role we have we need to accept and love people even if they are difficult and have difficult stories we all have difficult people yes and we all have difficult people but what happens if that difficult person you cannot apply children wisdom because they live with you children wisdom would be that each of us leaves every day but we cannot and if they live with you what if it is your wife your husband your boss with whom you share many hours of your life you can leave your boss but your wife well you can leave her too but that is not what we seek you can leave your father your mother your children but if they live with you what do you do what do you do if they live with you look one thing i have learned over time is that if they live with you and we take the wrong path which is to scold the other person to change them and i tell my wife change change change i do not like what you do and i do not like it and i tell my child stop fooling around you have been studying for ten days and you get bad grades that is not how people change if the first day i tell someone look i do not like what you do the first day okay but if the next day i say i do not like it and such and such the next day it happens less the third day again and so on by the fourth day it goes in one ear and out the other that is the wrong path if i want to generate results and change the attitude of the people i live with i have to do something key key i call it the key to not hurting their intelligence or dignity so for example my wife comes one day and says you know what today look what happened i left all this dirt on the floor eyes you always do the same thing i have been telling you for three years not to leave dirty clothes on the floor because i am organized a few days later i realize i was wrong \"gorda, forgive me i had a bad day sorry and then a few days later again \"gorda, you left all the clothes on the floor how long will it take and we start again sorry goddam excuse me in the office they scolded me clients fight with me people do not like me what ends up happening when i continue this it breaks then i find myself with my wife talking about things like why is not our relationship the same as before it is not the same as before because i have hurt your dignity so i want you to take away from here some very basic rules one behind a difficult person there is always a difficult story and most importantly to enter a difficult person and somehow understand them you have to accept and love them the key to entering a difficult person\\'s heart is exclusively their virtues recognizing their virtues and not focusing on their defects before finishing i always like to give you something so i decided to leave you more than a gift a wish and a wish that comes from an old iris blessing which says the following may the road rise to meet you may the wind always be at your back may the sun shine warm upon your face may the rains fall soft upon your fields and until we meet again may god hold you in the palm of his hands'}\n"

recent survey of millennial asking them what their most important life goals were and over 80 % said that a major life goal for them was to get rich and another 50 % of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous and we are constantly told to lean in to work to push harder and achieve more we are given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them those pictures are almost impossible to get most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but 2020. we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative but what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study many people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy we did that the hazard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that is ever been done for 75 years we have tracked the lives of 724 men year after years asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball further down the field but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived about 60 of our original 724 men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s. and we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men and i am the fourth director of the study since 1938, we have tracked the lives of two groups of men the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at hazard college they all finished college during world war i and then most went off to serve in the war and the second group that we have followed was a group of boys from button's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boson of the 1930s. most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed they were given medical exams we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top and some made that journey in the opposite direction the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today 75 years later telling you that the study still continues every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives many of the inner city boson men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just is not that interesting the hazard men never ask that question to get the clearest picture of these lives we do not just send them questionnaires we interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records from their doctors we draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said it is about time so what have we learned what are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we have generated on these lives well the lessons are not about wealth or fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get from this 75 year study is this good relationships keep us happier and healthier period we have learned three big lessons about relationships the first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier they are physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five america will report that they are lonely and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that it is not just the number of friends you have and it is not whether or not you are in a committed relationship but it is the quality of your close relationships that matters it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health high conflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective once we had followed our men all all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who was not and when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it was not their middle'-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old it was how satisfied they were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men and women reported in their is that on the days when they had more physical pain their moods stayed just as happy but the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain and the third big lesson that we learn about relationships on our health is that good relationships do not just protect our bodies they protect our brains it turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your is is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those people's memories stay sharper longer and the people in relationships where they feel they really cannot count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier memory decline and those good relationships they do not have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments did not take a toll on their memories so this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well'-being, this is wisdom that is as old as the hills why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore well we are human what we would really like is a quick fix something we can get that will make our lives good and keep them that way relationships are messy and they are complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends that is not sexy or glamorous it is also lifelong it never ends the people in our 75'-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates just like the millennial in that recent survey many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life but over and over over these 75 years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let us say you are 25 or you are 40 or you are 60. what might leaning into relationships even look like well the possibilities are practically endless it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member who you have not spoken to in years because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges i would like to close with a quote from mark twain more than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this there is not time so brief is life for bickering apologies heart burnings callings to account there is only time for loving but an instant so to speak for that the good life is built with good relationships thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 2: {'text': \"maya angel once said a solitary fantasy can transform a million realities what dream or vision do you want to turn into reality i always wanted to go into business for myself i could be a consultant i am going to go gluten free right after i eat that last piece of chocolate cake laughter you know one day i am going to stand up to that crabby boss i look good on paper i should feel great i just know there is more you know it because you feel it you lie awake at night you talk about your dreams with your partner and your friends but more often than not you continue to do those same behaviors that keep you from making the change you ask yourself how can i make it happened research shows the odds against you making a change in your life i i 9 to 1. 9 to i even if you are facing a life-threatening illness but let me show you how to beat those odds you can live the life you desire it is right there in front of you but in order to achieve it you must first see it then believe it and then you must graciously ask and train your brain to help you execute your vision so how do we see our vision through a picture a picture can create movement a picture... can unite nations a picture can pull at your heart and fill you with a deep desire to do something at rochet pharmaceutical the president asked us to create a picture of his vision prior to having one less than 40 percent of the employees understood the company's vision and strategy after seeing this picture 96 percent understood it and 84 percent understood how what they did everyday align to that picture so how can you use a picture to get what you want by simply drawing one you do not have to be an artist or know how to draw as naive as your drawings might be when you draw where you are your current state and where you want to be your desired new reality suddenly you have a road map for change so what is your current state well let us say you are joey job has a good job job has a lovely wife amyl job makes good money but like many of us job wants more from life and he would like to get rid of a couple of things maybe that intense workload maybe that negative boss maybe job has a higher purpose he is just not sure how to get there so now job's current state is visual we remember things better when they are attached to a picture 65 percent better to be exact so now let us imagine that job wants to change something in his current state he wants to build that desired new reality that he dreams about in order for job to freely dream he must first... ...trick his brain because the left side of your brain as you know houses the critics who is forever trying to keep you safe from harm make sure you do not do anything dangerous or stupid so let us have job tell the critic that he is just going to use his imagination using your imagination activates the right side of your brain which makes you creative and filled with possibility so now let us dream job's new life in the best case scenario one year from today what is job's life like hey job has a new job great job has a new boss himself job has a couple of great collaborators and job is just bursting with creativity and ideas and all of those things we dream about connection and purpose and freedom and love now i am drawing this picture as the favor to job today but in real life he would have to draw his own picture because he cannot afford me laughter actually because you get the most power when you paint your own picture so now job has his drawing so now he is got to soak it in he has to fill it with color he has to fill it with emotions he has to get inside of it as if he is on the inside looking out your brain actually emits serotonin and oxytocin when you draw and dream so you feel happy capable creative you feel cool so now we have job's current state and job's desired new reality so how can job get from here to there in just three bold steps three bold steps if i knew how to get from here to there in three bold steps i would have done it 25 years ago when i had a mullet laughter here is where the magic begins your brain knows you it is cataloged everything you have ever seen heard experienced real or imagined you just have to ask it to put the pieces together for you it as simple as that we live in a three-dimensional world but the light falls on the retina in a two-dimensional fashion and the brain it has to cope with it so how does it deal with this extra dimension it guesses it guesses and just as it can guess where your cup of coffee is when it goes to pick it up it can correctly guess what the three bold steps are that you should take all you have to do is look at your picture and then close your eyes this allows the brain to recycle what it sees and reconstruct it add to it everything you have ever seen heard experienced or fantasized about and then it will serve you up with the best possible solution if you just relax and you ask it now what is the boldest thing i could do to get from here to there boom immediately it will tell you see it believe it act on it now the danger is if any of those three bold steps are too scary this instinctual rational side of your brain is going to try to talk you out of this oh not not not i do not want to do that... oh that desk it is not too small my legs are not cramped under there oh 20,000 a years oh that is a decent salary oh that boss he is not that mean to me you know what i am just going to stay right here i feel really comfortable here so how can you get yourself to do the boldest thing by drawing the most compelling picture so when you look here you are in pain it hurts when you are here you are ecstatic it is fantastic you are already living inside that connected and free life you drew so everyday you get up you soak in your picture you step into the possibility and this is the most important part you act on it you do one small thing you call up that friend you know who started her own business you ask her how did you do it you ask amyl will you support me in my vision you go to your boss and you ask him for a raise and you become that one person out of ten to make change happen now i put this template on your chairs so that you can do for yourself what i just did for joey you have seen some fantastic ideas today that have inspired your dream i dare you to draw that dream into that template i double dare you to choose a symbol in your drawing that represents that desired new reality take a picture of it with your phone and send it to us at tedxrainier. maya angel said a solitary fantasy can transform a million realities just three bold steps can transform one reality yours thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 3: {'text': \"good morning how are you all i see you are calm i will try to share some tools that as marital said i have been with my company of ecological products for almost 20 years it has allowed me to develop professionally today it is the company that allows us all to live beyond the fact that we have also ventured into other alternative businesses during this time all those alternative businesses generally i do not remember any that turned out well the truth is that these things one tries to do sometimes end in some failures some losses and some bad moments but i like to start this way because if not one always talks only about the good parts of the story and if there is something we have all experienced it is that we learn much more from failures and mistakes than from the things that go well the truth is that it has to do with everything as many of the previous speakers have said we should not be afraid of failures they are just another part of life another part of work well basically i want to share some small tools that have helped me both at work and in some parts of life as well we try to organize and generate some organizational tools which we will be discussing but above all i want to share that i had the opportunity or rather the intention because i had the opportunity but i had the intention to study at the university i graduated as an enologist at an agricultural college which functioned in this great building and when one leaves these traditional tools those that we all know like primary school secondary school university master's degrees languages we sometimes realize that they are not enough when we enter the labor field we see that all these tools are very good very positive but they are not enough so my idea is to share some tools that i found more practical and that can help us tools that can help us to develop a business a life many things that we will be discussing and that will help us as we said all these tools are very good but we see that they are not enough so to organize this i want to make a small analogy of work or life in general with a journey what does this have to do with well we all have to be clear about many things whether the journey is short or long it does not matter we have to know where we are starting from what tools we have for the journey and we need to have a goal where we want to got many things may seem obvious and some speakers have already mentioned them but you will see that these obvious things are not always put into practice when it is time to act for example we need to know where we are where we want to got and how we plan for it for instance how do we plan for monday, how do we start monday, do we have it programmed analyzed and know what we will do this extends into the week the months the years our personal goals our work goals so i insist a lot on making the first analysis knowing exactly our starting point from there obviously the tools we need for the journey will emerge the tools we need to develop ourselves while all these traditional tools are good suddenly we can find many other tools in life that will help us progress one of the main tools is observing observe what observe the people around you to copy what they are doing well to take what you like from them and improve it adapt it to yourself these are all small things that will make us better and make things simpler and better the truth is that if you look around you will find a lot of people from parents friends colleagues all of them have something positive absolutely always you can learn something from them so it is very important to be an observer not just to see but to observe to copy and take the positive aspects also it is important to realize that we cannot surround ourselves with just anyone it may seem obvious but the truth is it is crucial to get closer to people who bring something positive who help us grow who complement us and distance ourselves from those who are negative who do not help who do not contribute make a small analysis of the people around you and you will see that by thinking positively there are many things you can learn and that you have not even noticed yet another typical thing especially as one starts to develop and grow is losing priorities it is fundamental to set priorities we all know examples the typical one who starts to do well and the first thing they do is buy a better care instead of capitalizing on their work it is important to have clear priorities and not lose them as we progress as the situation improves we must capitalize on our achievements and not rush into things another important thing is setting rules we all know we live in a country with many rules or at least many illogical rules but no one forces us to be stuck in that situation we can set our personal rules for example as the owner of my company i never do what i want i do not do what is best for me i do what is best for everyone this is a way of setting rules in the personal sphere in the business sphere we have certifications for several years we have had is certifications for commercialization and they help us stay organized and maintain a work line in a country that sometimes does not help in this sense instead of lamenting we can generate our own rules talking about travel there are many young people here i had the opportunity to play rugby and i got the chance to play in australia for a years and in italy for two years traveling is not easy today but there are endless opportunities and it is worth trying traveling generates personal growth and life experience that you cannot learn elsewhere it is a great way to learn languages and cultures if you get the chance choose wisely direct your efforts to places where you can gain the most like learning a new language finally having clear goals and dreams is essential it is crucial to have a great dream that motivates you no matter how big or small being convinced and determined will give you the strength to reach your goals with determination you can achieve whatever you want that is all thank you\"}\n",

things should be they keep us feeling safe and they also often prevent us from being fully present in our lives and from living to our highest potential so i am going to tell you about my journey away from expectation which also turned out to be a journey toward self empowerment and hope and then how it might apply to your relationships as well i first learned about the power of letting go of

by a stay at a mothering home a daughter who left the hospital before she did a bill for my foster care and ultimately my adoption my father paid penance by working as a bricklayer for a year before he to university in edinburgh they never saw each other again whatever expectations they had were letting go of expectations shattered on top of that they were told that they should be grateful privileged that they had a chance to redeem themselves and move on this is all pretty standard stuff for that time in place and i am telling you this because i want to note that although my parents learned not to expect in the wake of our separation this is not the productive kind of letting go the kind of letting go that they learned is rooted in shame and in punishment there is not any hope in it it is about shutting down and what i would like us to do today is learn how to let go and open up so fast-forward 18 years from that tearful breakup in the garage my adoptive father my dad had made it clear that he would totally understand if i wanted to go and find my natural family this is a lot easier in scotland than it is here they do not alter birth certificates the adoptee has the rights to all the records so i took myself off to the house of records in edinburgh and got hold of my birth certificate it had my birth name my mother's name her then address it took me another 18 years to decide to search the lead up to that would take another tedtalk or two mostly something had shifted inside me on a trip back in 2003 i walked past the house listed on the birth certificate and i just could not let it go after that i was led entirely by my gut i kind of had to be adoptee are less than i of the population only a few of assert and only a fraction of the people who search actually wind up being in reunion there are not enough of us for there to be a guidebook and for me this turned out to be a good thing it did help that i had had my own child my first child in somewhat similar circumstances to my own birth it also helped that i knew two other friends who were adoptee who were in reunion they had gone into the reunion with a litany of expectations one friend was in a relationship with her natural father that could best be termed as clandestine the other friend's father drank himself into ice the first time they met their relationships with all their natural families were fraught to say the least so i went in with an awareness of the letting go of hope risks i looked clearly at the risks and i decided to go ahead i went in also trying to pare back to what i really hoped without the expectation and what i hoped was to find my natural mother i wanted to know where i came from yes part of me did want the opah style reunion you know the one where you go and the whole gigantic attractive successful natural family welcomes the adoptee on whom they have been waiting their whole lives but i did not go expecting it i pared back and back to what was driving the hope i knew i had to hang on to that i knew i had to be whole and i had to expect nothing when i felt ready to do that i contacted birth link in scotland this is a nonprofit agency that helps adoptee and their families connect with each other i put my name on the list for a searcher that takes some months so in the waiting time i searched more deeply within myself i asked myself all kinds of odd questions what would i do if i found my mother and she was dying and needed my help what would i make of it if i found her and she was alcoholic obese if she was destitute a retired prostitute and i realized that anything that would bother me deeply would do so because i already saw it as a weakness in myself in other words anything i might want her to change was really something i wanted to change in myself i believe this is also called owning your own stuff owning your own stuff also talk to my brother he is also adopted and he said look heather the only thing you really have to worry about is if you go to meet her and she comes to the door with her bags packed and goes alright darling we are we going cut she thinks she is moving in with you anything else you can just run away from start is often good for a little bit of comedy with some truth embedded and he was right either one of us could end the relationship at any moment and is not that the case with all our relationships we behave as though in our relationships especially our significant ones we behave as though we are operating with some kind of a relationship union like a pipe fitters union that is going to uphold our expectation contract but the truth is relationships live in a right-to-work state any party and sometimes a third party like sudden death can end the contract with no notice and no cause and that is a scary truth to face but as with any other no guidebook truth all the expectation in the world cannot stop it what i knew what my net natural parents and i had lived for nearly four decades before we came face-to-face is that expectation does not guarantee you a thing so i entered the relationship knowing the risks i entered the relationship owning what i brought i entered the relationship without that guidebook and here's the good thing about there not being a guidebook there are not any articles about what a good reunion looks like like the articles you read that imply that all the other married couples have more sex than you the skinny woman next door eats cherry pie for breakfast the other guy's business makes more money than yours and it is more fun to work there all the things that build up our expectations and they record chances of honoring what is right in front of us so when i entered the relationship in this rest in way what i found that i was able to really rest in and notice small moments and to take joy there i noticed for instance the grain of my mother's freckled hand wrapped around her mug of tea the first time we met i got to experience her with the surest sureness of adulthood and the heart of a child i did not have my expectation checklist running through my head that is what expectations do they tend to run through our head act like a third party in our relationship constantly vying for our attention and that feels okay when things match up but even then we have stepped away from the moment and the relationship to check in with them and when things do not measure up then we really go aside we start talking to expectation asking it for affirmation he should have brought me flowers should not he she should run those meetings on time and our expectation list says oh yes honey you are right get back in there and make them do it your way so you keep asking and asking and getting grumpier and grumpier when things do not measure up if you have asked a couple of times and you have not gotten the response you wanted you are probably not going to get it and in that stepping away to measure up with expectation you have missed the moment and the relationship as it unfolded that might have offered a path forward and even when the worst thing happens when your expectations are not met and another path forward is not on offer you are then resting in the truth and you can choose to move yourself forward from the truth of that relationship in that moment expectation does not stop painful stuff from happening it just blames it on somebody else what expectations do is pull us out of the moment they hold us in an infinite loop of false possibility so i challenge you today to free yourself from this loop of false possibility before you leave this building this afternoon think of one relationship that has one unfulfilled expectation in it let the expectation go search yourself own your stuff commit to entering your next interaction in that relationship without the expectation hanging on to some hope and then just allowing yourself to fully rest in the reality of the moment whatever needs or wants you might have it is possible that those can be met in some other way but not by this person at this moment settle your heart to that and then move yourself forward i think you will find that if you can be brave enough to rest in reality human and flawed and possibly beautiful reality it will take you places better than you have ever dared to expect\"}\n"

      "Resultado 1: {'text': 'how exciting to be here what i am going to try and do today is add to the amazing lineup of speakers today by bringing the brain into our discussion of the creative spark and i want to do that by telling you about some of the newest research that i have been doing in my neuroscience research lab at new york university asking the question can aerobic exercise that is can going to the gym actually improve your learning memory and cognition i also want to address the question of whether increased aerobic exercise can also make you more creative now i remember the day that i realized i wanted to become a neuroscientist i was a freshman at up berkeley, and i was taking a freshman seminar class with just 10 or 15 of us called the brain and its potential taught by martian diamond she was standing at the front of the classroom and she had this beautiful hat box and with her gloved hands she opened that hat box and out she pulled a real live fixed human brain now it was the very first time i would seen a human brain and what she told us was that what she was holding in her hands was the most complex structure known to mankind it is the only structure that can think about itself and one of the most amazing things about the brain is that it can change as a function of the environment it can learn it can grow and i thought that was the coolest thing i would ever heard in my whole life and i did not know it that day but that idea of the brain and its potential and what is called neural plasticity - the ability to change as a function of the environment - was going to become my life\\'s work in science that is what i want to tell you about today so i started out studying a structure in the brain called the hippocampus it is really important for long-term memory but more recently i have become interested in how exercise can actually improve our learning memory and cognition and i got interested in that not because i read a paper or went to a talk i went to the gym when i turned 40, i decided i wanted to get in the best shape of my life and i went to the gym and the class that i found that kept me coming back to the gym on a really regular basis was a class called \"intensati,\" developed by this amazing fitness instructor named patrician more in new york city now intensity is unique because it takes physical movements from kickbox, dance yoga and martial arts but the unique part is that it pairs each physical movement with a positive spoken affirmation what do i mean by that so in intensati, we do not just punch we say i am strong now and the class says it back to you so what happens is that you not only get that great aerobic exercise but because you are speaking out you actually get an increase in aerobic output and it makes you feel great so the bottom line was i got in great shape but there were two amazing benefits that i noticed one was that i had this amazing motivation i felt like a million bucks after i came out of this class and i could not wait to go back and i thought my gosh patrician more is an amazing teacher to instill that kind of motivation and then i thought well wait a second i am a teacher i wonder if my students feel that way after my neuroanatomy class i am going to come back to that in a second the second amazing benefit was that when i went back to work - when i started doing intensity i was writing a lot of grants - and i noticed that as i got more regular with the workouts my writing got easier i was able to make associations better i was able to focus better and i thought this is amazing i want to look at the neuroscience literature to understand what is going on and i looked at the literature - a lot of new studies coming out as well as looking at some of the older studies that had led to our current understanding and when i looked at those i found a very familiar name that name was martian diamond so she was not only my undergraduate advisor but she was a real pioneer in neuroscience research and really only one of the only women working in this field back in the late 1950s and \\'60s, when she discovered that when you raise rats in what she called an enriched environment with lots of toys to play with other rats to play with and they run around a lot and you compared their brains to rats raised in what she called an impoverished environment with no toys just a couple of rats in a small box what you can do is measure their brain you measure actually the thickness of that outer covering of their brain called the cortex and what she found is that the rats raised in enriched environments had cortices that were actually thicker their brain grew as a function of this enriched environment and later studies showed that exercise the increased exercise those rats were getting because they were running around a lot more was a big factor in that brain change so i thought okay this is an area that i really want to get to know and as a professor the best way to get to know topic area is to teach a class so i decided i am going to teach a class at nu called can exercise change your brain and i decided because i got inspired to do this because of exercise i thought would not it be great if i could bring exercise into the classroom and not only teach students about what exercise is doing to their brain but also teach them have them experience what exercise felt like so i thought i could do this so i decided to go to the gym and of course i loved intensati, so i became a certified intensity instructor and a certified fitness instructor i could tell you oh it was so hard i was teaching classes i was writing grants but the truth is it was so much fun it was really fun because i got to learn a whole new way to move a whole new way to motivate students and i stayed in great shape so there was nothing better so i had this class i was teaching i was going to teach an hour of aerobic exercise i trained for six months to be able to teach in front of this class - i had never done this before but i thought it would be fun - so teach an hour of aerobic exercise an hour of intensati, followed by an hour-and-a-half lecture on the effects of exercise in the brain but then i realized i had my first study right there my students could be my subjects in my first study all i had to do was test them cognitively at the beginning at the end of the semester and compare their performance to a class that did not exercise and ask whether in fact exercise could improve their cognitive performance so that is exactly what i did and before i tell you what our prediction was and what our results were i just want to take you back for a moment to september i 2009, which was the first day of this can exercise change your brain class and it is seared in my memory mainly because i was really scared and nervous i give many many lectures i love giving lectures but this one i was very nervous why because my goal was to actually try and inspire these kids to love exercise in the way that patrician more inspired me but also inspire them to love neurobiology and the brain and plasticity the way that martian diamond inspired me so i had a pretty high bar and i was pretty scared to step out in front of that classroom but i have to say i think the students were a bit scared too they would never come to a class where the instructor came in workout clothes they would never sweated in front of their professor and i got a lot of nervous laughter when i told them they were going to have to say positive affirmations not not say yell positive affirmations in class but i have to say it was the most memorable first class i have ever taught the students really got into it okay there was nervous laughter and a lot of giggling but they really got into it they were shouting the affirmations they were really going all out in the workout and the best thing was that motivation and that inspiration oozed over into our academic our lecture part they remained engaged asked lots of questions it was a fantastic first class and a fantastic semester so what did we find so our prediction goes back to that structure that i said was important for long-term memory the hippocampus it goes back to the hippocampus because the hippocampus is one of only two brain structures where new brain cells new neurons are born so you and i have shiny new hippocampus cells being born in our hippocampus but the cool thing is that experimental studies in animals have shown that increased aerobic exercise can actually enhance the birth of those new hippocampus neurons and make them live even longer so our prediction was that this increase in aerobic exercise in my nu students would actually improve their learning and memory improve their ability to learn new pieces of information and improve their ability to retain those new pieces of information did we find that well we tested them on a whole battery of different cognitive tests and what we found was one significant improvement in my class that improvement was in the ability to encode new long-term memories what task was that it was a complicated task it was actually a quite difficult task students were given a really complex geometrical image - it was like an etch-a-sketch image - and then after a delay they would have to discriminate between that etch-a-sketch image and one that looked very very similar to it my students got significantly faster at identifying the correct image that they saw before so they are able to separate out things that are coming in your memory for example you are meeting lots of new people here today and so you might be better if you exercise and come to my class at differentiating between the faces of different people that you meet today so that is a very very useful thing to be able to do so is this new what is new about this well it is new and exciting because - i have to say we are not the only people my lab is not the only lab interested in the effects of exercise but the majority of the work has been done on looking at the effects of exercise in the elderly population why because cognitive decline is a major health issue in the elderly not to even mention alzheimer\\'s disease the exciting news in the elderly population is that increased aerobic exercise has clearly been shown to improve cognition so that is great but the idea there is that there is decline already so you have a little bit of room to see improvement what about my healthy young very smart nu neuroscience majors they are at the peak of their cognitive abilities as are you and i could exercise actually help us our studies suggest that yes they can now we are not only interested in learning memory and cognition but there is a really exciting link to the topic of today\\'s conference that is creativity and that comes from one of the newest directions of study of the hippocampus we have known for a very very long time that exercise can improve - sorry - that the hippocampus is important for long-term memory but recent studies have suggested the hippocampus is also important for creativity and imagination why because patients with hippocampus damage have significant impairments at being able to imagine new situations so we ask a patient with hippocampus damage describe for me a tropical beach scene - they have never been to a tropical beach they can barely say anything about sand or water whereas a control subject would be able to tell you about the white sand and the corona in their left hand with that an umbrella in it all these different details so the idea is the hippocampus is not only important for putting new associations in mind that help you remember the events like this in your past - it will be in your past - but also important for putting new concepts together in unique ways the basis of both creativity and imagination so what we want to do - we have not done this - is to look at the effects of exercise not only on learning and memory but on increased creativity as well so what is the bottom line here the bottom line is simple increased aerobic exercise can improve learning memory and possibly creativity what is more to know and everybody wants a magic pill to get smarter well this is not a pills and it comes with a lot more sweat than a pills but it can help you it is free it helps you every day and our goal over the next ten years is trying to figure out exactly how that is helping you what exactly is changing in the brain so i only have one question for you who wants to go to the gym anybody okay great thank you'}\n",
      "Resultado 2: {'text': \"all right hello so i have had a lifelong fascination with how we organize how we humans work together to express some work or some purpose in the world and i would like to start by sharing a story bit about my journey it is a story that is true and it is become a bit of a metaphor for my own my own path i have a private a harrowing experience pilot's license and when i was first learning to fly i had a rather harrowing experience i am up in the plane i am still a student pilot i have 20-some hours of flight time i yes they let you fly a plane alone with 20-some hours of practice so i am up in this plane it is my first cross-country solo flight so the first time i am flying hundreds of miles away from home with no instructor with me and i am all ready for the journey i go up i start flying little nervous and the low voltage light comes on they do not teach you much about how the plane works right barely not apply the thing so you know what do i do well my first instinct is to you know tap the low voltage light but that does not change anything my next instinct is to check my other instruments to see if there is a big problem here right so one by one i check all of my other instruments the altimeter says you are not losing altitude there is nothing wrong all right the navigation aid says you are perfectly on course congratulations everything's fine the airspeed indicator says you are not losing speed you are flying fast everything's great so i let those other instruments outvote the low voltage light yeah i figured nothing else is reporting anything anomalous it must not be that big of a problem right that was a really bad idea turns out who would have thought that low voltage light is actually tuned in to different information than every other instrument on that control panel oops i nearly crashed the plane that day and fortunately i did make it down there were some steps in the middle there i will skip for you but i made it down and after the adrenaline wears off it occurs to me we do this in our organizations all the time when we humans show up in organizations we become the sensors the instruments for that organizations flight towards its purpose we sense reality on its behalf it is through us that it becomes aware of whatever it needs to deal with or do in the world and we humans are different and we sense different things we have different talents backgrounds different types different talents we sense different things and it is sometimes something sensed by only one person or by the many minority that is critical to integrate into how we proceed and we often ignore them and this really echoed my experience back when i worked in more conventional organizations that was my experience i showed up in a company i wanted to be a sensor for this company i wanted to be an instrument i sensed reality and i wanted to do something with it and i am sure all of you have had the experience of going into some organization somewhere and sensing something important maybe it is a hole in a process or a way to improve something that is not working as well as it could be something slipping through the cracks and i would often have those experiences but have nothing i could do to act on them right there would be no way to integrate that into the organization in fact i no way to integrate learned early on that if the boss did not sense it i was not gonna get it processed have you ever seen that you know you sense something important but the boss just does not see it good luck that shuts down the organization's capacity to integrate and harness whatever it was that i tuned in to find the low-voltage light were in trouble so my quest since then has been how can we humans show up as sensors for our organizations and i did the only logical thing i was i became a boss this is more personal now how can i show up and to be a sensor for organization the only logical thing once i realized that anything i sensed that the boss did not was not gonna get address well i became a boss right that is nice and simple now i get to really run things the way i think they should be you know and unfortunately i realized there was still another boss you know so after climbing the corporate ladder a bit i got fed up with that and realized all right the only way i am really going to be able to process anything my sense is if i drop out of this whole game and start my own company where i get to be the coo at the top and now there is no boss getting in the way of processing whatever it is i am sensing so i did that i started a software company and built it over many years and you know at first that worked great i could get a lot of the stuff i sensed processed but then something unfortunate happened i realized well i am not even able to even as the coo as this company's growing i am not even able to take everything that i see and get it processed the systems are not responsive enough right the way we have structured and built our organizations today does not let me even as the coo get everything i sense integrated and harnessed and processed and that was not actually the worst of it the far more painful realization was i had just built the very system that i had struggled so long and tried to move past right now everyone else in that company did not get whatever it was that they could tune into and sense harnessed and integrated unless i saw it and no matter how much i might work on myself focus on my own development try to be the most empowering servant leader i can be the reality is i am still a human i still have bad days i still miss things right and i had built the very system that i had tried to escape so my question then shifted a bit it became how do i build something different and how do i build a system where that is not the case where anything since by anyone can integrate and change the organization to help it better express whatever work it is doing in the world so one of the things we attention realized is there is incredible energy there in the things we sense when we tune in to a gap between where we are and what could be right we call this attention because we often sense it as tension right that it is not just intellectual it is that feeling in your gut the frustration that comes when you see a process that you know could be better or you are banging your head into the same damn problem multiple times you feel tense you feel this tension about it could also be an opportunity if something exciting but it is this gap between where we are and where you sense we could be and just like a rubber band stretched between two points there is such energy there although we often tension experience it as a negative i do not mean it that way at all and if we can do something with it becomes energy not frustration right the root of the word tension in satin tense era means to stretch it is a stretch so how can we power an organization fuel its continual evolution its continual updating how it works and how we work together based on these tensions that we sense so interesting question hard thing to do and we tried a lot of things so we experimented over years we tried running an organization via consensus seemed like a good idea at the time it was a complete disaster if you ever want to sit in long painful meetings all the time and never get anything done try running your organization with consensus what i realized was there is a consensus big difference between having a voice and actually being able to do something with your voice being able to actually process everything you sense into some kind of meaningful change consensus did not do it in fact often that would result in long painful meetings where we all tried to get everyone to see it the same way i do not want my low voltage light to have to see things the same way as my fuel gauge i do not need that and it is not a healthy system in fact i want to let each of them sense what they can sense best and all integrate into the flight plan so how can we have an organization where any tension sense by anyone anywhere in the company has someplace to go to get rapidly and reliably processed into meaningful change that was the question consensus did not work so we tried other things and we started finding approaches we started coming up with something and one of the first things we realized on that journey is we actually need to harness autocratic harness autocratic authority the very thing we moved away from in the beginning right autocratic authority because if we are sensing on behalf of the organization and we want to be dynamic and fast and responsive which we have to be to process everything everyone senses most of the things we sense we need to act on locally we need to be not just sensors but actors in this system and to do that we need the authority to act without having to go to a painful meeting and try to get everybody bought into every decision you want to make in cells in the human body other words we need to be a lot more like cells in the human body each one needs a clear boundary within which it has autonomy that has authority but what you do not see is a coo cell right a manager cell directing the others what to do each cell has its own autonomy but it is distributed that is the direction we moved in a system where everybody has autocratic authority but they know the bounds of their authority they know the interconnections they know when they have to get somebody ease's input or when they have to integrate with someone they know the bounds of their authority and the connections they know what they the process can expect of each other and in most organizations we have managers to fill the central point to do that to align all of us and to distribute authority but we have already covered the limits of that so how can we do that without managers in the way well for that we need a process if we do not have managers to align and integrate we need a process which aligns and integrates a process which lets each of us be a sovereign autonomous agent on behalf of this organization and its purpose and integrate in other words we need something that is a lot less like a feudal hierarchy and a lot more like a constitutional entity and that is exactly what we have so in my organization i work in every day i get to experience this it is quite liberating in my organization now we have no coo we have no managers every individual partner in that firm has real authority that no one else can trump but it is distributed we each have different authority and we know the bounds and the limits of each and we have a constitution that defines how we integrate together a constitution that defines a governance process which is not governed of the people by the people for the people but rather is governance of the organization through the people as sensors for the purpose whatever it is we are here to do together when we have that kind of tangible system real processes that hold and distribute real authority and integrate us and figure out how do we need to interconnect and align expectations when that process allows everyone to have a voice for the sake of the purpose and when you have a process to integrate anything you sense conclusion anything you sense whatsoever any constraint on expressing this this purpose in the world and you can integrate it and change and reshape the organization dynamically in real time reshape how we work together what authority everyone has you have got a system that is dramatically more responsive and adaptable without the waste of managers in the way limiting what tensions you can process all of this we have captured in what we call a new social technology for organizations it is a new operating system it is tangible that constitutions available on our website and you can find it you can find organizations running with it all over the world now it is spreading is called holacracy you can find more at our website holacracy or and learn a bit more about how this system aligns us to each to the purpose each of us to the purpose while giving us the freedom and autonomy and yet an integrated whole thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 3: {'text': \"good morning let me tell you i am extremely excited to be here this morning i get the opportunity to stand before all of you and to tell you about the inspiration in my life organ and to tell you how she has played such a major role in my life in the lives of so many people who have special needs now before i get into all the details of that i want to back up a little bit and tell you how i got to this point as was mentioned i was in the home building business land development business started when i was 19 and really loved the business and had an opportunity for 21 years to really get the business to run exactly like i wanted it to i had an opportunity to get into the mortgage business title business all sorts of different businesses and then 2005 came and a company out of californium said we will not put you in retirement and if you remember back then business was really booming things were wild and crazy and the economy and so i said okay so i sold the companies and then i went from the day of running numerous companies to the point of then going okay what am i going to do in the second half of my life so many opportunities came to me i had an opportunity to get into different businesses reinvest in big ways and do some neat stuff but i also had the opportunity to take my daughter to school something i never had a chance to do i was able to go to organ's birthday parties and get to know her friends and talk to them and talk to parents he said let me tell you a little bit about organ organ just turned 18 years old but organ has special needs organ has a tough time adding two plus two she can get there but you got to work at it with her organ has a tough time reading a simple sentence she will get there but it is tough and she will get frustrated she will get upset at herself and wish she was someone else organ is someone who has 26 screws in her back and two rods and two hangers to allow her to stand up straight let me tell you what organ has it is more important than anything she has an attitude that is absolutely incredible every night when we put her to bed she has a smile on her face every morning she has a smile on her face she has gone through all these different obstacles and things but always keeps an attitude that is incredibly strong and so through that inspiration and the opportunity to talk and see more and understand more about the special needs community instead of all the opportunities that may exist from a business perspective i decided maybe the second half of my life she would be dedicated towards something else and that was all because of the inspiration and the attitude of this wonderful young lady now what does that mean well what i thought i had should do is build a foundation or form a foundation which i did and we do numerous things but one of the things that we wanted to do is we wanted to go out and build something or things as we were building the foundation that would be here for a long term would that be building medical facilities or different things in the community such as schools et that would be here long lasting to help the special needs community but then something happened about five years ago that really caused what i am here to talk about today and that is organ's wonderland you see we were on a family trip and organ loves to go swimming she does not really know how to swim like a and she is not real good at it but she loves to flap around in the water and do what kids do we went down to the pool at the hotel and it was late and day it was a smaller hotel a smaller pool and there were three kids at the other end of the pool and there were two of them were throwing a ball back and forth and organ and i were to pull i got out and organ i saw was slowly inching her way over and she wanted to play with those kids she could not tell him that she did not know how to really bring about that interaction so what happened is is organ started moving closer and closer she eventually hit the ball she got that close and the kids were looking at her like what are you doing organ just wanted to play what happened at that point is where this all happened those nice kids grabbed the ball and they all got out of the pool they got out of the pool because they did not know what it would be like to really explore the habit of the joy and the happiness of playing was someone who maybe could not verbally say exactly what she wanted but she would just like them in so many ways but because they did not understand that the interaction of play did not occur as organ turned around i saw her face and i thought to myself oh my god she just looked at me like i do not get it she did not say anything she went back i jumped in the pool we played i sat there and we did we continued on for a couple weeks i after that vacation i kept thinking about that turner organ's head to me and the look that she had and i have to tell you kept thinking about it thinking about it i said there is got to be a place that i can we can take organ to where everybody understands what is going on there in the element of play and there will be interaction between those who have special needs and those who do not have special needs i did not know what that meant so i thought well i will call some people i will go around look at different parks in the country just to see if there is something outside that we could replicate or take organ to or do something so somehow bring that barrier down to where the next time there are kids in that pool they will go hey come on over they will understand and that play will occur so i went around the country looking at a different place is that at least we are told that may be in line and nothing was closed what i found if anything had anything to tie with special needs that a lot of times it was off the beaten path it was not in the middle of everything else it was all kind of by itself and i said to myself let us do one of these in san anionic what is this i do not know what i am going to do i am just going to do it so i invited a bunch of people to a meeting to talk about the idea of building this part but and i just had a sheet of paper behind me that was basically white and i said i got this idea tell you what happened and we can do better nine invited doctors and therapists and teachers and people who have special needs and we all spent hours and hours and hundreds of people showed up i thought this is kind of cool because we do not really know what we are even gonna be talking about doll and they all showed up and we went over and we went over and over and talked about if we built this park with the theory of and the idea of trying to bring down that barrier what would be in it well what i heard was numerous things eight and a half pages of single tight ideas then i said okay what i want to do is i want to get outside the box i want to hire people to do this who have never done a part before i want to hire an architect who is never done a part before i wanted to hire an engineer who is never done a part before i want to hire graphics people have never done a part before because i am gonna be told by them how you are supposed to build a park and we are gonna be different this time so all these people who in did everything from organ's wonderland had never done it before that was the cool part what they had those some real grassroots ideas presented by people in the middle of it all the people who really work with special needs individuals on a daily basis and understand it and those who has special needs themselves what i heard more than anything was give us a place that is safe you see if i have a child who is autistic to go to the park is tough because you never know when that child might take a run would not we need to go to a park and know that somehow if that child did run that you could kind of relax for a little bit so when you go to organ's wonderland everybody gets an rid tag so we know exactly where they are at all times in the parking you can find them through any of the video screens that exist throughout the park the reason that exists is so that you can sit in if johnny runs off it is okay you can go find them you know exactly where he is and you will know everybody in your party within three seconds we brought that kind of technology and we also said not only do we want a safe place but we want a good environment we want an environment that is a little different does that mean well think about it if you are in a wheelchair and you go to these wonderful places do great job from an 88 perspective gives new world in all these places but the crowds and the time it might take to do something and impatience of people because they are not sometimes old at organ's women let us build a place that maybe could hold 4,500 or 5,000 people but let us not ever have more than about 1,500 or 2,000 in there this build it bigger so that the environment is one to where if you want to get on to a carousel and it takes longer because our carousel allows no matter what your physical or mental special need may be that we will allow you an opportunity to get on that carousel and if it takes ten minutes see if the culture of organ's wonderland it is okay we will help you and get you on that carousel and everybody is patient because that is what organ's wonderland is about there is no other carousel like the one at organ's wonderland there is no other offload adventure ride like the one at organ's wonderland there is no other train like the one that is at organ's wonderland these are not big magical ideas what we did basically at organ's wonderland i am so proud of the people who had never done this before but they said this look we are going to design a park for special needs but we are going to build it for everyone because when you walk into organ's wonderland it looks like any other park you do not see ramps and all that kind of stuff it is a place where you walk in and go i can play here know whether i have a special need or not but those who do have special needs they can do everything we take the most fragile children and adults those who are on ventilators those who sometimes unfortunately just have three days to live who say then the family says can they come over there and have an opportunity we had a child come to organ's wonderland that was three days before he died he had an opportunity he smiled he had that because he was able to do what he wanted to do and the family knew what he wanted to do and he could not have done it anywhere else in the world except that this unique part now as i talked earlier when i got to know organ's friends and families and stuff what i found out his morning was really one of the lucky ones you see organ has what she needs she has a physical therapist and the doctors and the and all that because i have been blessed to be able to give that to her but see i noticed that many times those with special needs do not have always all those economic opportunities to give their child are those who they care for what they really need so we made it early on and commitment that anyone who comes to organ's wonderland always comes for free always comes for free it does not matter we do not look it up in a book and define what special needs is if you say you have a special needs when you especially need when you come to the front you get in for free we figure if you lie about it you have a special need and so it is it is it is it is our approach saying we are here because we are gonna give you a break and we are gonna allow it the opportunity that if you want to come to this park thirty times a year you come to the park 30 times a year and you can ride to train seven times if you want to and we have some children who just stay on the train the whole time that is what they want that is that consistency is what they like at another place could they do that no no now through this entire process it is been amazing to see what has occurred i have to tell you a story about organ it kind of gives you a sense of what a place like this does i know what people he is asked me what does organ like to do when she goes to the park well at first all she would do is go on the swings we have 35 swings five different kinds whether you are in a wheelchair whatever your physical or mental special need maybe you can swing at organ's cornball organ we just go on the swings i see organ let us go on the carousel no shooing too close to it just scared of it all right let us go no let us go stand next to the carousel okay finally she did that then organ after a while eventually said i said organ let us just go and sit on an animal no okay finally she did that then we got her on an elephant could not can go just will sit on and then organ and then getting her off the elevator was in up thumb will go under but then the next time we went organ said we wanted to go to the carousel and when she went to the carousel now she would get on it and she would go one time real slow remember everybody else is in the park and enjoying the park with her at this point no pressure there is no pressure it is just simply but here's the neat thing organ now when she goes to the park goes to the carousel first and rides it on her own okay well why is that a big deal well organ now when she finishes the first time she looked at me said are you proud of me dad yeah and that is what happens at organ's wonderland you take a child who it seems like a small thing to write on a care so that is a big deal little things are big things and at organ's wonderland through play they learn they learn that they have the opportunity to achieve something just as even if it is a small thing just riding a carousel organ does not want me near the carousel when she rides now because she does not independently and it is taught her something and on the 26 different attractions that fit in this thirty-five million dollar park ultra accessible park it gives opportunities to thousands tens of thousands and i am happy to say over two hundred thousand people in such a short period have already been through the park not just from here matter of fact one out of two people who come to spark going come from this area they come from outside here they come from outside this the state they come from outside this country thirty four different countries have been represented at organ's wonderland already and here's the neat thing we do not have a marketing budget it is all done by word of mouth because those who have special needs and those who are caregivers and those who are involved in this whole thing are really tight-knit people and they are starving for something like this i did not know that at first i knew they were but i did after i had that first meeting where my said yeah there is something here but what was the neatest thing about that meeting is once that happened and started is that how this community and the community even outside the city all joined together you see we just started this idea in 2007 when we actually started thinking let us talk about this we finished it thirty nine months later we raised almost all the money we are about five six million dollars short of raising all the 435 million dollars but we did it because of passionate people who came together quickly and said the time has been too long for something like this remember five and a half percent of population requires assistance every day or they cannot make it through there there is fifteen percent of the population is special-needs we are not talking from a million people we are talking 50 million people in this country who are special need it is a big big number and we are just scratching your surface since we do not have a marketing budget it is word of mouth but we are seeing people come from all over and finding always make a wish we are one the top locations for make-a-wish people come here because this is a place they can go anywhere but organ's wonderland is special it is a special place for our special friends and for all those it is not just about the special needs in the video though it is about everybody being able to play together three out of four people who come to more is where i do not have a special need you see they join in with those who have especially and it brings down that barrier that happened in that pool because then that child who is 21 years old who has the mental capacity of a five year old who is playing in that sand circle feels very comfortable and he is got eight year old and twelve year old playing right around him and that brings down that barrier and that allows him who could go nowhere else and playing a fan circle the opportunity to do that but do it in an environment that he loves a place that he feels safe his family feels comfortable and everybody is working in conjunction for the element of inclusion that is organ's wonderland that is organ's one life now when you let people a lot of them in for free and you put on a lot of free things you do not you are not going to make money that is what organ's wonderland is not about it is not about selling tickets it is about offering a service now how did you do that well i wanted to put something together working with a lot of wonderful people that would would do two things one being economics and one being about explaining that whole element of inclusion and that is next to organ's wonderland is a seventy-five acres soccer park so people always ask me i do not get it cordon soccer especially i do not get it soccer plays a big role why soccer well on what in our thoughts and my feeling about all this is that we need to bring something to san anionic and there is a sport in san anionic that i did not feel was really being properly dealt with from the standpoint of giving quality facilities to and that was soccer so why do not we take something help the overall community tie it next door to a special needs a part that is for those with special needs in the entire community so when thousands of people come and play soccer on these four of 14 different fields they will get that and ask the question what is it and then it will bring awareness you think it brings awareness so you do something good with your community you bring awareness but then you do another thing we rent those fields into renting these top-quality fields we bring money over to organ's wonderland to help with the operations of it it is incredible you can go there and see 7,000 people on a weekend play soccer on these fields when these big tournaments go and these tournaments do not just come from san anionic this region they come from around the state and around the country but when they come here they learn they learn and it brings the exposure up of those who have special needs in the idea of inclusion so let us take it one step further last year we bought a pro soccer team and we are bringing it to san anionic they will start play they will start playing in six months across the street from organ's woodland but then there is going to be a community stadium built right across the street from organ's water line and so through that through the scorpions through all the different events that occur in this community stadium that is being built all with private funds what will ultimately happen is we will bring hundreds of thousands of people and through the most popular sport in the world every time that team travels around north america competing it will be able to talk about soccer but it will also be able to talk about organ's wonderland what is foreland it is a place of inclusion we all bring people together so it plays a revenue source because money from that will ultimately go to organ's winner oil 100% but it will also bring awareness to what it is all about so organ's wonderland is not just the sticks and bricks to me it is about a movement it is about an approach of being able to do something different it is about the idea of saying the time is now to get outside the box let me in was one little thought i get letters and emails from people all the time basically daily telling me about organ's wonderland i love reading him but i got one the other day i want to share with you and it is this lady who this young lady who was leaving with her daughter who was autistic and as they were walking out to the car the young daughter said mom did we just leave heaven and when she told me that i thought to myself we have got a little heaven here on earth at organ's one life thank you very much the opportunity\"}\n",
      "Resultado 4: {'text': 'so i will start with this a couple years ago an event planner called me because i was going to do a speaking event and she called and she said i am really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyers and i thought well what is the struggle and she said well i saw you speak and i am going to call you a researchers i think but i am afraid if i call you a researchers no one will come because they will think you are boring and irrelevant laughter and i was like \"okay.\" and she said but the thing i liked about your talk is you are a storyteller so i think what i will do is just call you a storyteller and of course the academic insecure part of me was like you are going to call me a what and she said i am going to call you a storyteller and i was like why not magic pixie\\'s laughter i was like let me think about this for a second i tried to call deep on my courage and i thought you know i am a storyteller i am a qualitative researchers i collect stories that is what i do and maybe stories are just data with a soul and maybe i am just a storyteller and so i said you know what why do not you just say i am a researcher-storyteller.\" and she went ha had there is no such thing laughter so i am a researcher-storyteller, and i am going to talk to you today we are talking about expanding perception and so i want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that i live and love and work and parents and this is where my story starts when i was a young researchers doctoral student my first years i had a research professor who said to us there is the thing if you cannot measure it it does not exist and i thought he was just sweet-talking me i was like \"really?\" and he was like \"absolutely.\" and so you have to understand that i have a bachelor\\'s and a master\\'s in social work and i was getting my ph.d. in social work so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the life\\'s messy love it and i am more of the life\\'s messy clean it up organize it and put it into a bent box laughter and so to think that i had found my way to found a career that takes me really one of the big sayings in social work is clean into the discomfort of the work and i am like knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all as that was my mantra so i was very excited about this and so i thought you know what this is the career for me because i am interested in some messy topics but i want to be able to make them not messy i want to understand them i want to hack into these things that i know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see so where i started was with connection because by the time you are a social worker for 10 years what you realize is that connection is why we are here it is what gives purpose and meaning to our lives this is what it is all about it does not matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice mental health and abuse and neglect what we know is that connection the ability to feel connected is neurobiologically that is how we are wired it is why we are here so i thought you know what i am going to start with connection well you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss and she tells you 37 things that you do really awesome and one opportunity for growth laughter and all you can think about is that opportunity for growth right well apparently this is the way my work went as well because when you ask people about love they tell you about heartbreak when you ask people about belonging they will tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded and when you ask people about connection the stories they told me were about disconnection so very quickly really about six weeks into this research i ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that i did not understand or had never seen and so i pulled back out of the research and thought i need to figure out what this is and it turned out to be shame and shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection is there something about me that if other people know it or see it that i will not be worthy of connection the things i can tell you about it it is universal we all have it the only people who do not experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection no one wants to talk about it and the less you talk about it the more you have it what underpinned this shame this i am not good enough which we all know that feeling i am not blank enough i am not thin enough rich enough beautiful enough smart enough promoted enough the thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability this idea of in order for connection to happen we have to allow ourselves to be seen really seen and you know how i feel about vulnerability i hate vulnerability and so i thought this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick i am going in i am going to figure this stuff out i am going to spend a years i am going to totally deconstruct shame i am going to understand how vulnerability works and i am going to outsmart it so i was ready and i was really excited as you know it is not going to turn out well laughter you know this so i could tell you a lot about shame but i would have to borrow everyone ease\\'s time but here\\'s what i can tell you that it boils down to and this may be one of the most important things that i have ever learned in the decade of doing this research my one year turned into six years thousands of stories hundreds of long interviews focus groups at one point people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories thousands of pieces of data in six years and i kind of got a handle on it i kind of understood this is what shame is this is how it works i wrote a book i published a theory but something was not okay and what it was is that if i roughly took the people i interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness that is what this comes down to a sense of worthiness they have a strong sense of love and belonging and folks who struggle for it and folks who are always wondering if they are good enough there was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it and that was the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they are worthy of love and belonging that is it they believe they are worthy and to me the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we are not worthy of connection was something that personally and professionally i felt like i needed to understand better so what i did is i took all of the interviews where i saw worthiness where i saw people living that way and just looked at those what do these people have in common i have a slight office supply addiction but that is another talk so i had a manila folder and i had a sharpie and i was like what am i going to call this research and the first words that came to my mind were \"whole-hearted.\" these are wholehearted people living from this deep sense of worthiness so i wrote at the top of the manila folder and i started looking at the data in fact i did it first in a four-day, very intensive data analysis where i went back pulled the interviews the stories pulled the incidents what is the theme what is the pattern my husband left town with the kids because i always go into this jacks pollock crazy thing where i am just writing and in my researcher model and so here\\'s what i found what they had in common was a sense of courage and i want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minutes courage the original definition of courage when it first came into the english language it is from the satin word \"cor,\" meaning heart and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart and so these folks had very simply the courage to be imperfect they had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others because as it turns out we cannot practice compassion with other people if we cannot treat ourselves kindly and the last was they had connection and this was the hard part as a result of authenticity they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were which you have to absolutely do that for connection the other thing that they had in common was this they fully embraced vulnerability they believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful they did not talk about vulnerability being comfortable nor did they really talk about it being excruciating as i had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing they just talked about it being necessary they talked about the willingness to say i love you first ... the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ... the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram they are willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out they thought this was fundamental i personally thought it was betrayal i could not believe i had pledged allegiance to research where our job you know the definition of research is to control and predict to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict and now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting this led to a little breakdown laughter which actually looked more like this laughter and it did i call it a breakdown my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening laughter a spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown but i assure you it was a breakdown and i had to put my data away and go find a therapist let me tell you something you know who you are when you call your friends and say i think i need to see somebody do you have any recommendations because about five of my friends were like \"wooo, i would not want to be your therapist laughter i was like what does that mean and they are like i am just saying you know do not bring your measuring stick laughter i was like \"okay.\" so i found a therapist my first meeting with her liana i brought in my list of the way the wholehearted live and i sat down and she said how are you and i said i am great i am okay she said what is going on and this is a therapist who sees therapists because we have to go to those because their best meters are good laughter and so i said there is the thing i am struggling and she said what is the struggle and i said well i have a vulnerability issue and i know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness but it appears that it is also the birthplace of joy of creativity of belonging of love and i think i have a problem and i need some help and i said but here\\'s the thing no family stuff no childhood shit laughter i just need some strategies laughter applause thank you so she goes like this laughter and then i said it is bad right and she said it is neither good nor bad laughter it just is what it is and i said oh my god this is going to suck laughter and it did and it did not and it took about a years and you know how there are people that when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important that they surrender and walk into it a that is not me and be i do not even hang out with people like that laughter for me it was a yearlong street fight it was a slugfest. vulnerability pushed i pushed back i lost the fight but probably won my life back and so then i went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they the wholehearted what choices they were making and what we are doing with vulnerability why do we struggle with it so much am i alone in struggling with vulnerability not so this is what i learned we numb vulnerability when we are waiting for the call it was funny i sent something out on twitter and on casebook that says how would you define vulnerability what makes you feel vulnerable and within an hour and a half i had 150 responses because i wanted to know what is out there having to ask my husband for help because i am sick and we are newly married initiating sex with my husband initiating sex with my wife being turned down asking someone out waiting for the doctor to call back getting laid off laying off people this is the world we live in we live in a vulnerable world and one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability and i think there is evidence and it is not the only reason this evidence exists but i think it is a huge cause we are the most indent ... obese ... addicted and medicated adult cohort in us history the problem is and i learned this from the research that you cannot selectively numb emotions you cannot say here\\'s the bad stuff here\\'s vulnerability here\\'s grief here\\'s shame here\\'s fear here\\'s disappointment i do not want to feel these i am going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin laughter i do not want to feel these and i know that is knowing laughter i hack into your lives for a living god laughter you cannot numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects our emotions you cannot selectively numb so when we numb those we numb joy we numb gratitude we numb happiness and then we are miserable and we are looking for purpose and meaning and then we feel vulnerable so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin and it becomes this dangerous cycle one of the things that i think we need to think about is why and how we numb and it does not just have to be addiction the other thing we do is we make everything that is uncertain certain religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty i am right you are wrong shut up that is it just certain the more afraid we are the more vulnerable we are the more afraid we are this is what politics looks like today there is no discourse anymore there is no conversation there is just blame you know how blame is described in the research a way to discharge pain and discomfort we perfect if there is anyone who wants their life to look like this it would be me but it does not work because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks laughter which just i hope in 100 years people will look back and got \"wow.\" laughter and we perfect most dangerously our children let me tell you what we think about children they are hardwired for struggle when they get here and when you hold those perfect little babies in your hands our job is not to say look at her she is perfect my job is just to keep her perfect make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and male by seventh that is not our job our job is to look and say you know what you are imperfect and you are wired for struggle but you are worthy of love and belonging that is our job show me a generation of kids raised like that and we will end the problems i think that we see today we pretend that what we do does not have an effect on people we do that in our personal lives we do that corporate whether it is a bailout an oil spill ... a recall we pretend like what we are doing does not have a huge impact on other people i would say to companies this is not our first rodeo people we just need you to be authentic and real and say ... we are sorry we will fix it but there is another way and i will leave you with this this is what i have found to let ourselves be seen deeply seen vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts even though there is no guarantee and that is really hard and i can tell you as a parents that is excruciatingly difficult to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror when we are wondering can i love you this much can i believe in this this passionately can i be this fierce about this just to be able to stop and instead of catastrophizing what might happen to say i am just so grateful because to feel this vulnerable means i am alive and the last which i think is probably the most important is to believe that we are enough because when we work from a place i believe that says i am enough ... then we stop screaming and start listening we are kinder and gentler to the people around us and we are kinder and gentler to ourselves that is all i have thank you'}\n",
      "Resultado 5: {'text': \"good morning how are you all i see you are calm i will try to share some tools that as marital said i have been with my company of ecological products for almost 20 years it has allowed me to develop professionally today it is the company that allows us all to live beyond the fact that we have also ventured into other alternative businesses during this time all those alternative businesses generally i do not remember any that turned out well the truth is that these things one tries to do sometimes end in some failures some losses and some bad moments but i like to start this way because if not one always talks only about the good parts of the story and if there is something we have all experienced it is that we learn much more from failures and mistakes than from the things that go well the truth is that it has to do with everything as many of the previous speakers have said we should not be afraid of failures they are just another part of life another part of work well basically i want to share some small tools that have helped me both at work and in some parts of life as well we try to organize and generate some organizational tools which we will be discussing but above all i want to share that i had the opportunity or rather the intention because i had the opportunity but i had the intention to study at the university i graduated as an enologist at an agricultural college which functioned in this great building and when one leaves these traditional tools those that we all know like primary school secondary school university master's degrees languages we sometimes realize that they are not enough when we enter the labor field we see that all these tools are very good very positive but they are not enough so my idea is to share some tools that i found more practical and that can help us tools that can help us to develop a business a life many things that we will be discussing and that will help us as we said all these tools are very good but we see that they are not enough so to organize this i want to make a small analogy of work or life in general with a journey what does this have to do with well we all have to be clear about many things whether the journey is short or long it does not matter we have to know where we are starting from what tools we have for the journey and we need to have a goal where we want to got many things may seem obvious and some speakers have already mentioned them but you will see that these obvious things are not always put into practice when it is time to act for example we need to know where we are where we want to got and how we plan for it for instance how do we plan for monday, how do we start monday, do we have it programmed analyzed and know what we will do this extends into the week the months the years our personal goals our work goals so i insist a lot on making the first analysis knowing exactly our starting point from there obviously the tools we need for the journey will emerge the tools we need to develop ourselves while all these traditional tools are good suddenly we can find many other tools in life that will help us progress one of the main tools is observing observe what observe the people around you to copy what they are doing well to take what you like from them and improve it adapt it to yourself these are all small things that will make us better and make things simpler and better the truth is that if you look around you will find a lot of people from parents friends colleagues all of them have something positive absolutely always you can learn something from them so it is very important to be an observer not just to see but to observe to copy and take the positive aspects also it is important to realize that we cannot surround ourselves with just anyone it may seem obvious but the truth is it is crucial to get closer to people who bring something positive who help us grow who complement us and distance ourselves from those who are negative who do not help who do not contribute make a small analysis of the people around you and you will see that by thinking positively there are many things you can learn and that you have not even noticed yet another typical thing especially as one starts to develop and grow is losing priorities it is fundamental to set priorities we all know examples the typical one who starts to do well and the first thing they do is buy a better care instead of capitalizing on their work it is important to have clear priorities and not lose them as we progress as the situation improves we must capitalize on our achievements and not rush into things another important thing is setting rules we all know we live in a country with many rules or at least many illogical rules but no one forces us to be stuck in that situation we can set our personal rules for example as the owner of my company i never do what i want i do not do what is best for me i do what is best for everyone this is a way of setting rules in the personal sphere in the business sphere we have certifications for several years we have had is certifications for commercialization and they help us stay organized and maintain a work line in a country that sometimes does not help in this sense instead of lamenting we can generate our own rules talking about travel there are many young people here i had the opportunity to play rugby and i got the chance to play in australia for a years and in italy for two years traveling is not easy today but there are endless opportunities and it is worth trying traveling generates personal growth and life experience that you cannot learn elsewhere it is a great way to learn languages and cultures if you get the chance choose wisely direct your efforts to places where you can gain the most like learning a new language finally having clear goals and dreams is essential it is crucial to have a great dream that motivates you no matter how big or small being convinced and determined will give you the strength to reach your goals with determination you can achieve whatever you want that is all thank you\"}\n"

      "Resultado 2: {'text': \"i have a problem how many times do we say that and we tend to think that it is because we have problems that we struggle in life it is not true if we struggle in life it is because we have parts within ourselves parts who are suffering parts who are afraid and most importantly who believe nothing can be changed this is the reason why we struggle up until a few months ago i thought i had a problem which was that i found it hard to speak about me in public on a personal level but i did oka because as a doctor most often it was related to medical or scientific topics and as a results there was no discomfort until the day i received a call from someone who means a great deal to me and who invited me to talk about my experience on the use of the psychotherapy model which i am introducing to you tonight and that i use at my hospital but he did ask specifically for me to make it personal since it was my experience and i quickly declined his invitation because there was a little voice inside my head telling me you have nothing of interest to say well i thought i was at peace with that but then few weeks or months later that same person calls me up again and again asks for me to present at that time i thought there most certainly was something to unravel here because if this person who means a lot to me asks again for me to come and talk about my experience there is something unfinished about this at first i asked him to give me a little time told him that i needed to think it through and i used this time to look inwards to look inwards to know who was telling me that i had nothing interesting to say to other people on a personal level to do so it is important to take a moment here is how i did it i focused inwards on this voice calmly and in a curious manner who is it at first all i heard was this message you have nothing of interest to say and then as i kept asking i heard something else if this person really knew you he would not ask you to do that he really has no idea who you are you have nothing interesting to say it went on for a while after a while i realized that this voice came from a person a part of me and that this person had all the traits of a critics a judge from within this was an important discovery because i could really become aware of the presence of this person and as a results i could genuinely talk with him ask him questions such as why do you keep on telling me all this why do you have this purpose in my life to criticize me to judge me the way you do what are you afraid of if i did accept the invitation and went to the conference to talk about myself it was really interesting because all of a sudden the tone changed and instead of criticism came something quite moving deep inside i am afraid that you may relive something hard you have experienced before so first i thanked this part for his caring intention and i then asked it know would you agree to step aside and to let me reconnect with this hardship you want to prevent me from reliving he agreed to that and behind this part of me was another part a little boy eight years of age he was standing by the door of the apartment i used to live in at the time he was standing absolutely frozen and he did not know i was there because for all these years the critic was standing between the two of us and so it took a little time for this little boy to realize that i was there and that i was there for him and so we started talking open heatedly i asked him if he would want to tell me about himself his story why he was frozen we took a moment and talked about his suffering his emotions once he turned to me and recognized me and trusted me enough he started explaining to me telling me things things i already knew but he said them again from deep inside his heart told me that he was the youngest of a family who was going through a hard time then with many agencies to deal with and that whenever this little boy wanted to talk about himself there was no room no time for that as a consequences he ended up thinking that what he thought was important to say in his heart was of no interest since nobody cared or so it seemed to him this was an important time because from this moment on he felt completely understood and so i asked him now that he knew i understood him whether he would leave the past behind and be interested to join me in the present whether he was interested in changing his way of life clearly he was and so i told him for this to happen there is something important for you to do it is to get rid of everything linked to this hardship and that still weighs on you he agreed to do so to relieve himself of his burden and to my great surprise i met a bold adventurous little boy very eager to join me and go to this conference once this change had taken place i turned to the critic and asked so how are things for you now do you still need to play this role in my life and once again to my surprise he said no i do not need to anymore i see that you can take care of this boy he is safe now i then asked would you accept to play another part to do something else less difficult less burdening he said woke i will be your adviser now i will assist you so the little boy the adviser and myself got to work we prepared the conference and people quite liked it why did i choose to tell you this story here tonight after all it is a story pertaining to familiar elements being hurt being defensive and maybe one would frown upon such a happy ending still there are key points i want to share with you linked to my own experience both with this little boy but also with the therapy model i came here to tell you about first the importance to meet the parts within ourselves how important this relationship is second why is it stuck inside as a result of what and that not dealing with it will prevent any change thirdly it can change there is a plan be what i did when i looked within was that i connected with it i could have talked to somebody about my problem i even could have mentioned my parts to them but instead i went within myself francs within franchise and connected with these parts first the critics then the boy and this is essential because when a connection is created from within myself changes occur a feeling of security and trust emerges and this allows for an important thing to happen which is for this critic to show himself beyond what he tells me who he truly is his underlying positive intention towards me he wanted to protect me it allows him to take a risk the second thing was why was it all stuck inside why was the boy stuck in the apartment the answer is quite simple it is because of his burden what is his burden it is the suffering which is attached to the hardship and this suffering is still there it was in or on the little boy the little boy was stuck there thinking he was not interesting the problem with the burden and the parts of us bearing it is that these parts absorb it all these parts believe they are the burden itself they forgot that they are merely bearing it they believe they are it and as a results this burden becomes a poison a genuine poison bums in our societies we like them so long as they are far enough from us they are dirty they stink they drink they yell they are unclean and so we tend to stay away from these members of society the same thing happens within ourselves there are parts of ourselves who are not attractive who stink who have experienced such hardships that have come to be unworthy of love because they are not pretty inside and so within ourselves we do the same thing we do with bums we shield ourselves from them and isolate them inside how do we do that well it is quite simple actually there are other parts in us who are quite good at this and create a protective barrier they are called protectors so who are the protectors well they are these parts in us which are linked to our habits our reassuring ways of dealing with things for example taking a little pill before going to bed because it is a little too hard without it or to have a couple of glasses because there is a difficult meeting ahead and we want to be relaxed or this overwhelming urge to succeed in life or to rely on your intellect to understand everything or to do sports because one has to release one's energy somehow and calm one's anxiety all these behaviors which are a little bit over the top which make us feel like we do not really have a choice in the matter these are the protectors within us there are parts within us doing all this and fortunately so because they help us cope with our pain they help prevent us from feeling down and when we feel down because we are in contact with these wounded parts they help us getting away from them because it is just too painful to stay there the problem is that these parts are scared because they know that if they stop what they are doing the fire of pain will rise again in our lives and so this fear prevents them from stopping why well since the wounded parts are convinced that they are their own burden that they are dirty the protective parts have no choice but to protect them and behave in our lives sometimes to extremes even to the point of being destructive either for us or for others this is the first tragedy the second tragedy is that we end up thinking the same thing they do that change is not an option that we are stuck with this forever and that is why it is important to know that there is a plan be plan b is the plan you use whenever what you tried first did not succeed plan a is i am hurt i protect myself plan b is something else it is doing what i did it is going within myself francs within franchise meeting these parts it is important because first it allows for the understanding of the intention the history the pain but mostly it brings security it allows for my protectors your protectors to stand aside enough so that i in a loving way can access these wounded parts and when these parts feel the compassion and love they agree to do what my little boy did which is to release their burden and to come back to their real nature and from then on our protective parts can consider stopping what they do what they are exhausted doing and causes us problems in life this person this francs within francs who could do all this is like a flame inside it is who i really am deep inside of me in the ifs psychotherapy model i am introducing to you tonight the internal family systems model this flame is called the self and i would like to leave you with a message that we share the adviser the little boy and myself this message is that this self is always here no matter what happened to us even the worst situations even in the most chronic situations this flame is always here available as an invitation to our protectors to trust and an invitation to these suffering parts to relieve themselves from their pain an invitation to our parts to relieve themselves from what weighs on them and come back to their true nature thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 3: {'text': \"what keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life if you were going to invest now in your future best self where would you put your time and your energy there was a recent survey of millennial asking them what their most important life goals were and over 80 % said that a major life goal for them was to get rich and another 50 % of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous and we are constantly told to lean in to work to push harder and achieve more we are given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them those pictures are almost impossible to get most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but 2020. we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative but what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study many people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy we did that the hazard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that is ever been done for 75 years we have tracked the lives of 724 men year after years asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball further down the field but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived about 60 of our original 724 men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s. and we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men and i am the fourth director of the study since 1938, we have tracked the lives of two groups of men the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at hazard college they all finished college during world war i and then most went off to serve in the war and the second group that we have followed was a group of boys from button's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boson of the 1930s. most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed they were given medical exams we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top and some made that journey in the opposite direction the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today 75 years later telling you that the study still continues every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives many of the inner city boson men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just is not that interesting the hazard men never ask that question to get the clearest picture of these lives we do not just send them questionnaires we interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records from their doctors we draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said it is about time so what have we learned what are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we have generated on these lives well the lessons are not about wealth or fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get from this 75 year study is this good relationships keep us happier and healthier period we have learned three big lessons about relationships the first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier they are physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five america will report that they are lonely and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that it is not just the number of friends you have and it is not whether or not you are in a committed relationship but it is the quality of your close relationships that matters it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health high conflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective once we had followed our men all all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who was not and when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it was not their middle'-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old it was how satisfied they were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men and women reported in their is that on the days when they had more physical pain their moods stayed just as happy but the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain and the third big lesson that we learn about relationships on our health is that good relationships do not just protect our bodies they protect our brains it turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your is is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those people's memories stay sharper longer and the people in relationships where they feel they really cannot count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier memory decline and those good relationships they do not have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments did not take a toll on their memories so this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well'-being, this is wisdom that is as old as the hills why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore well we are human what we would really like is a quick fix something we can get that will make our lives good and keep them that way relationships are messy and they are complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends that is not sexy or glamorous it is also lifelong it never ends the people in our 75'-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates just like the millennial in that recent survey many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life but over and over over these 75 years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let us say you are 25 or you are 40 or you are 60. what might leaning into relationships even look like well the possibilities are practically endless it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member who you have not spoken to in years because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges i would like to close with a quote from mark twain more than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this there is not time so brief is life for bickering apologies heart burnings callings to account there is only time for loving but an instant so to speak for that the good life is built with good relationships thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 4: {'text': \"early in my life i learned that there was one thing that could kill a festive mood at a dinner party and that was to talk about me to talk about my life my life as the daughter of a cult leader there was very little that was joking or lighthearted about the first 28 years of my life so i avoided that topic at all costs it was too painful nobody could understand so i became a master at diverting attention at during the conversation on to somebody else but not me i so rarely talked about my life that on the rare occasion when i would slip and somebody would kind of push for me to divulge i could not just casually and comfortably share it i would bond with the story and it would go something like this well i grew up outside of chico and my dad pastured actually a wonderful church there that through the years evolved into a 15,000 member cult it operated and it still operates under the guise of an independent fundamental baptist church but those who have left the followers have tried to leave outsiders even the media it was on 20/20 last year recognize that it is clearly a cult every member was in complete obedience father they did not dare disagree or be disloyal for fear of being publicly ridiculed or punished or banished for doing so they did not go on a vacation without asking my dad's permission and he had said they drink the kool-aid i am not kidding they would have my dad lived a double life one of righteous family man and dynamic speaker in the public eye but one of sordid sexual secrets privately secrets that only my siblings and me and my mom knew he hated my mom hated her treated her terribly abused her and even turned his own children against our mother we hated her he told us she was crazy we thought to make him happy we would hate her too our home was felt full of turmoil hatred stress strife and as a little girl it was isolating it was intense and it was frightening he had affairs had a mistress for many years the wife of a sunday-school teacher built her family a beautiful home right around the corner from our house you could see their family from our back door it was it was craziness living one way preaching another my brother my older brother he became another version of my father he took a he pastured a church in texts was found to have been having affairs with 14 different women divorced that current wife married one of the 14 my father tried desperately to cover it up moved into another church where he was found to have had 17 there was with different women and he just recreated what he had seen my dad with and my dad did nothing but cover it up i felt like i had one main responsibility as a child it was simple but daunting and that was to keep all the secrets there were so many you see he had taught us that the best way to please god was to please him because he was god's man and he taught us that to please him we had to keep all the secrets we could not even tell our best friends what went on in our home because we might be the causes for the destruction of his ministry i literally feared my very life if i ever talked about my dad's ministry but what went on in our home for fear that it would hurt his ministry i was so afraid and the greater the secrets the greater the fear and the greed of my determination to keep quiet i gotta tell you the money part of it was pretty nice as a kid i mean think about it tithes and offerings from 50,000 people know it created a lavish lifestyle for our family my father owned most of the city where the church was he owned to college to high schools to great schools a cemetery blocks of buildings he was very wealthy and even into our adult years he owned us he owned our homes our cars our furniture he owned our lives and we did not dare cross him because we were to her whose everything he died a multimillionaire he left nothing to his children he left everything to the organization which my younger sister and her husband now need and they still perpetuate his legacy the strict rules the undying loyalty and they still try to keep all the secrets i never understood why was i the only one that the four kids so tortured by the hypocrisy so disturbed by the mind control over thousands and thousands of people and so determined to find a better life why was i the only one that insisted on answers to my questions and why was i the only one that ultimately broke away and cut ties with the brainwashing the oppression the fear the secrets and the life that had never been my life i finally walked away when i was about 28 years of age then being estranged from my entire family and i did not see my family again until many years later at my dad's funeral okay see what i mean not a story to share at a dinner party i really got to the point after i left dinner that i could not talk about me for one thing who would understand for another thing it was too hard it hurt too bad so i made a mental note and permanent marker that said must never talk about my life and for many years i did not i could not however wonderful things had happened through the years since their therapy a lot of therapy deprogramming freedom from the mind control and i began to heal and learn and accept and forgive and even learn to be thankful that bizarre life that i had because i realized i was learning some amazing lessons from not only being there but from having the guts to leave and i now have values that are deeply carved in my very soul from that instead of these you do not get for reading a book or from a workshop or another person bellies that are only this deeply ingrained when you live what i live because my dad was a cult leader i now embrace three values and no one will ever take these away from me the first one is freedom to explore my own interests freedom to live within my own value system freedom to determine my own value system freedom to believe what i believe and never stifle what i believe freedom to disagree for you to ask questions and require honest answers freedom to learn who i am and freedom to love who i am the second value was truth i learned pretty quickly that i was not going to be very free until i dealt with what was true and that was hard for me truth was a scary word for me because i mean my entire life i had never been allowed to speak of what went on in our home i had never told even my best friends what went on in our house being truthful was one of the scariest things i could think of i learned that secrets grown in the dark but when exposed to the light of truth they start to lose their power many person my dear amazing therapist in callas texts who nurtured me and who loved me through years and years of healing she used to say to me kinda you are only as sick as your secrets you are only as sick as your secrets so i stopped keeping secrets and as scared as i was in my late is i finally began to deal with what was true i think it finally began to speak what was true and eventually learned how to live openly only in truth and the third value is courage did you know that you actually cannot have freedom or truth if you have no courage is a requirement for both you may desire to live in complete free and the complete truth but if you are lacking and courage you will live in neither one in my late is i had a tiny shred of courage not much but it was all i needed because my desire to live and be free and honest was somewhat great but that teeny shred of courage that i had was enough to allow me to walk away i have a plaque on my desk that i have had for years and it is gone with me everywhere i have ever moved it says the secret to happiness is freedom and the secrets of freedom is courage and that resonated with me i knew it was not going to be happy unless i was free but i knew i was not going to be free my second some courage to get out of there i had to cling to and act upon that tiny shred of courage in order to finally leave a cult the only friends i never know my childhood connections my history my family knowing that in doing so i finally have what i had longed for my entire life and that was freedom true freedom truth courage three words that maybe kind of trite and overused to some people to me they are the air that i breathe values upon which i insist on living and loving in my life oh and one other thing i actually know about you sharing my story talking about me i now recognize that it is in sharing my story and i can so passionately share with you my values gained over 28 years not an emotional prison that kept my heart under lock and key and kept my mind for knowing what i knew you know i sometimes wonder if perhaps living in the absence of our values is what can most clearly determine what indeed our values are and for me i really believe that the apes and the denial of created the presence of for so many years i was denied freedom truth and courage and now i will never let them go not to worry you are still not going to find me at a dinner party he is talking about my childhood not going to happen you will not find me sitting around elaborating over my father who took a wonderful church and turn it into a fifty thousand member cult i still know that is a mood killer i get it but you will find me here and in other appropriate settings especially if i can help somebody talking about my life with sincere gratitude for all that i have learned in spite of and because of living in the absence of freedom truth and courage and thank god i now have by now you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 5: {'text': \"good morning how are you all i see you are calm i will try to share some tools that as marital said i have been with my company of ecological products for almost 20 years it has allowed me to develop professionally today it is the company that allows us all to live beyond the fact that we have also ventured into other alternative businesses during this time all those alternative businesses generally i do not remember any that turned out well the truth is that these things one tries to do sometimes end in some failures some losses and some bad moments but i like to start this way because if not one always talks only about the good parts of the story and if there is something we have all experienced it is that we learn much more from failures and mistakes than from the things that go well the truth is that it has to do with everything as many of the previous speakers have said we should not be afraid of failures they are just another part of life another part of work well basically i want to share some small tools that have helped me both at work and in some parts of life as well we try to organize and generate some organizational tools which we will be discussing but above all i want to share that i had the opportunity or rather the intention because i had the opportunity but i had the intention to study at the university i graduated as an enologist at an agricultural college which functioned in this great building and when one leaves these traditional tools those that we all know like primary school secondary school university master's degrees languages we sometimes realize that they are not enough when we enter the labor field we see that all these tools are very good very positive but they are not enough so my idea is to share some tools that i found more practical and that can help us tools that can help us to develop a business a life many things that we will be discussing and that will help us as we said all these tools are very good but we see that they are not enough so to organize this i want to make a small analogy of work or life in general with a journey what does this have to do with well we all have to be clear about many things whether the journey is short or long it does not matter we have to know where we are starting from what tools we have for the journey and we need to have a goal where we want to got many things may seem obvious and some speakers have already mentioned them but you will see that these obvious things are not always put into practice when it is time to act for example we need to know where we are where we want to got and how we plan for it for instance how do we plan for monday, how do we start monday, do we have it programmed analyzed and know what we will do this extends into the week the months the years our personal goals our work goals so i insist a lot on making the first analysis knowing exactly our starting point from there obviously the tools we need for the journey will emerge the tools we need to develop ourselves while all these traditional tools are good suddenly we can find many other tools in life that will help us progress one of the main tools is observing observe what observe the people around you to copy what they are doing well to take what you like from them and improve it adapt it to yourself these are all small things that will make us better and make things simpler and better the truth is that if you look around you will find a lot of people from parents friends colleagues all of them have something positive absolutely always you can learn something from them so it is very important to be an observer not just to see but to observe to copy and take the positive aspects also it is important to realize that we cannot surround ourselves with just anyone it may seem obvious but the truth is it is crucial to get closer to people who bring something positive who help us grow who complement us and distance ourselves from those who are negative who do not help who do not contribute make a small analysis of the people around you and you will see that by thinking positively there are many things you can learn and that you have not even noticed yet another typical thing especially as one starts to develop and grow is losing priorities it is fundamental to set priorities we all know examples the typical one who starts to do well and the first thing they do is buy a better care instead of capitalizing on their work it is important to have clear priorities and not lose them as we progress as the situation improves we must capitalize on our achievements and not rush into things another important thing is setting rules we all know we live in a country with many rules or at least many illogical rules but no one forces us to be stuck in that situation we can set our personal rules for example as the owner of my company i never do what i want i do not do what is best for me i do what is best for everyone this is a way of setting rules in the personal sphere in the business sphere we have certifications for several years we have had is certifications for commercialization and they help us stay organized and maintain a work line in a country that sometimes does not help in this sense instead of lamenting we can generate our own rules talking about travel there are many young people here i had the opportunity to play rugby and i got the chance to play in australia for a years and in italy for two years traveling is not easy today but there are endless opportunities and it is worth trying traveling generates personal growth and life experience that you cannot learn elsewhere it is a great way to learn languages and cultures if you get the chance choose wisely direct your efforts to places where you can gain the most like learning a new language finally having clear goals and dreams is essential it is crucial to have a great dream that motivates you no matter how big or small being convinced and determined will give you the strength to reach your goals with determination you can achieve whatever you want that is all thank you\"}\n"

      "Resultado 1: {'text': \"what keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life if you were going to invest now in your future best self where would you put your time and your energy there was a recent survey of millennial asking them what their most important life goals were and over 80 % said that a major life goal for them was to get rich and another 50 % of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous and we are constantly told to lean in to work to push harder and achieve more we are given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them those pictures are almost impossible to get most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but 2020. we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative but what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study many people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy we did that the hazard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that is ever been done for 75 years we have tracked the lives of 724 men year after years asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball further down the field but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived about 60 of our original 724 men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s. and we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men and i am the fourth director of the study since 1938, we have tracked the lives of two groups of men the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at hazard college they all finished college during world war i and then most went off to serve in the war and the second group that we have followed was a group of boys from button's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boson of the 1930s. most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed they were given medical exams we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top and some made that journey in the opposite direction the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today 75 years later telling you that the study still continues every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives many of the inner city boson men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just is not that interesting the hazard men never ask that question to get the clearest picture of these lives we do not just send them questionnaires we interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records from their doctors we draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said it is about time so what have we learned what are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we have generated on these lives well the lessons are not about wealth or fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get from this 75 year study is this good relationships keep us happier and healthier period we have learned three big lessons about relationships the first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier they are physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five america will report that they are lonely and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that it is not just the number of friends you have and it is not whether or not you are in a committed relationship but it is the quality of your close relationships that matters it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health high conflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective once we had followed our men all all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who was not and when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it was not their middle'-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old it was how satisfied they were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men and women reported in their is that on the days when they had more physical pain their moods stayed just as happy but the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain and the third big lesson that we learn about relationships on our health is that good relationships do not just protect our bodies they protect our brains it turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your is is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those people's memories stay sharper longer and the people in relationships where they feel they really cannot count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier memory decline and those good relationships they do not have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments did not take a toll on their memories so this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well'-being, this is wisdom that is as old as the hills why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore well we are human what we would really like is a quick fix something we can get that will make our lives good and keep them that way relationships are messy and they are complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends that is not sexy or glamorous it is also lifelong it never ends the people in our 75'-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates just like the millennial in that recent survey many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life but over and over over these 75 years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let us say you are 25 or you are 40 or you are 60. what might leaning into relationships even look like well the possibilities are practically endless it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member who you have not spoken to in years because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges i would like to close with a quote from mark twain more than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this there is not time so brief is life for bickering apologies heart burnings callings to account there is only time for loving but an instant so to speak for that the good life is built with good relationships thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 2: {'text': 'how exciting to be here what i am going to try and do today is add to the amazing lineup of speakers today by bringing the brain into our discussion of the creative spark and i want to do that by telling you about some of the newest research that i have been doing in my neuroscience research lab at new york university asking the question can aerobic exercise that is can going to the gym actually improve your learning memory and cognition i also want to address the question of whether increased aerobic exercise can also make you more creative now i remember the day that i realized i wanted to become a neuroscientist i was a freshman at up berkeley, and i was taking a freshman seminar class with just 10 or 15 of us called the brain and its potential taught by martian diamond she was standing at the front of the classroom and she had this beautiful hat box and with her gloved hands she opened that hat box and out she pulled a real live fixed human brain now it was the very first time i would seen a human brain and what she told us was that what she was holding in her hands was the most complex structure known to mankind it is the only structure that can think about itself and one of the most amazing things about the brain is that it can change as a function of the environment it can learn it can grow and i thought that was the coolest thing i would ever heard in my whole life and i did not know it that day but that idea of the brain and its potential and what is called neural plasticity - the ability to change as a function of the environment - was going to become my life\\'s work in science that is what i want to tell you about today so i started out studying a structure in the brain called the hippocampus it is really important for long-term memory but more recently i have become interested in how exercise can actually improve our learning memory and cognition and i got interested in that not because i read a paper or went to a talk i went to the gym when i turned 40, i decided i wanted to get in the best shape of my life and i went to the gym and the class that i found that kept me coming back to the gym on a really regular basis was a class called \"intensati,\" developed by this amazing fitness instructor named patrician more in new york city now intensity is unique because it takes physical movements from kickbox, dance yoga and martial arts but the unique part is that it pairs each physical movement with a positive spoken affirmation what do i mean by that so in intensati, we do not just punch we say i am strong now and the class says it back to you so what happens is that you not only get that great aerobic exercise but because you are speaking out you actually get an increase in aerobic output and it makes you feel great so the bottom line was i got in great shape but there were two amazing benefits that i noticed one was that i had this amazing motivation i felt like a million bucks after i came out of this class and i could not wait to go back and i thought my gosh patrician more is an amazing teacher to instill that kind of motivation and then i thought well wait a second i am a teacher i wonder if my students feel that way after my neuroanatomy class i am going to come back to that in a second the second amazing benefit was that when i went back to work - when i started doing intensity i was writing a lot of grants - and i noticed that as i got more regular with the workouts my writing got easier i was able to make associations better i was able to focus better and i thought this is amazing i want to look at the neuroscience literature to understand what is going on and i looked at the literature - a lot of new studies coming out as well as looking at some of the older studies that had led to our current understanding and when i looked at those i found a very familiar name that name was martian diamond so she was not only my undergraduate advisor but she was a real pioneer in neuroscience research and really only one of the only women working in this field back in the late 1950s and \\'60s, when she discovered that when you raise rats in what she called an enriched environment with lots of toys to play with other rats to play with and they run around a lot and you compared their brains to rats raised in what she called an impoverished environment with no toys just a couple of rats in a small box what you can do is measure their brain you measure actually the thickness of that outer covering of their brain called the cortex and what she found is that the rats raised in enriched environments had cortices that were actually thicker their brain grew as a function of this enriched environment and later studies showed that exercise the increased exercise those rats were getting because they were running around a lot more was a big factor in that brain change so i thought okay this is an area that i really want to get to know and as a professor the best way to get to know topic area is to teach a class so i decided i am going to teach a class at nu called can exercise change your brain and i decided because i got inspired to do this because of exercise i thought would not it be great if i could bring exercise into the classroom and not only teach students about what exercise is doing to their brain but also teach them have them experience what exercise felt like so i thought i could do this so i decided to go to the gym and of course i loved intensati, so i became a certified intensity instructor and a certified fitness instructor i could tell you oh it was so hard i was teaching classes i was writing grants but the truth is it was so much fun it was really fun because i got to learn a whole new way to move a whole new way to motivate students and i stayed in great shape so there was nothing better so i had this class i was teaching i was going to teach an hour of aerobic exercise i trained for six months to be able to teach in front of this class - i had never done this before but i thought it would be fun - so teach an hour of aerobic exercise an hour of intensati, followed by an hour-and-a-half lecture on the effects of exercise in the brain but then i realized i had my first study right there my students could be my subjects in my first study all i had to do was test them cognitively at the beginning at the end of the semester and compare their performance to a class that did not exercise and ask whether in fact exercise could improve their cognitive performance so that is exactly what i did and before i tell you what our prediction was and what our results were i just want to take you back for a moment to september i 2009, which was the first day of this can exercise change your brain class and it is seared in my memory mainly because i was really scared and nervous i give many many lectures i love giving lectures but this one i was very nervous why because my goal was to actually try and inspire these kids to love exercise in the way that patrician more inspired me but also inspire them to love neurobiology and the brain and plasticity the way that martian diamond inspired me so i had a pretty high bar and i was pretty scared to step out in front of that classroom but i have to say i think the students were a bit scared too they would never come to a class where the instructor came in workout clothes they would never sweated in front of their professor and i got a lot of nervous laughter when i told them they were going to have to say positive affirmations not not say yell positive affirmations in class but i have to say it was the most memorable first class i have ever taught the students really got into it okay there was nervous laughter and a lot of giggling but they really got into it they were shouting the affirmations they were really going all out in the workout and the best thing was that motivation and that inspiration oozed over into our academic our lecture part they remained engaged asked lots of questions it was a fantastic first class and a fantastic semester so what did we find so our prediction goes back to that structure that i said was important for long-term memory the hippocampus it goes back to the hippocampus because the hippocampus is one of only two brain structures where new brain cells new neurons are born so you and i have shiny new hippocampus cells being born in our hippocampus but the cool thing is that experimental studies in animals have shown that increased aerobic exercise can actually enhance the birth of those new hippocampus neurons and make them live even longer so our prediction was that this increase in aerobic exercise in my nu students would actually improve their learning and memory improve their ability to learn new pieces of information and improve their ability to retain those new pieces of information did we find that well we tested them on a whole battery of different cognitive tests and what we found was one significant improvement in my class that improvement was in the ability to encode new long-term memories what task was that it was a complicated task it was actually a quite difficult task students were given a really complex geometrical image - it was like an etch-a-sketch image - and then after a delay they would have to discriminate between that etch-a-sketch image and one that looked very very similar to it my students got significantly faster at identifying the correct image that they saw before so they are able to separate out things that are coming in your memory for example you are meeting lots of new people here today and so you might be better if you exercise and come to my class at differentiating between the faces of different people that you meet today so that is a very very useful thing to be able to do so is this new what is new about this well it is new and exciting because - i have to say we are not the only people my lab is not the only lab interested in the effects of exercise but the majority of the work has been done on looking at the effects of exercise in the elderly population why because cognitive decline is a major health issue in the elderly not to even mention alzheimer\\'s disease the exciting news in the elderly population is that increased aerobic exercise has clearly been shown to improve cognition so that is great but the idea there is that there is decline already so you have a little bit of room to see improvement what about my healthy young very smart nu neuroscience majors they are at the peak of their cognitive abilities as are you and i could exercise actually help us our studies suggest that yes they can now we are not only interested in learning memory and cognition but there is a really exciting link to the topic of today\\'s conference that is creativity and that comes from one of the newest directions of study of the hippocampus we have known for a very very long time that exercise can improve - sorry - that the hippocampus is important for long-term memory but recent studies have suggested the hippocampus is also important for creativity and imagination why because patients with hippocampus damage have significant impairments at being able to imagine new situations so we ask a patient with hippocampus damage describe for me a tropical beach scene - they have never been to a tropical beach they can barely say anything about sand or water whereas a control subject would be able to tell you about the white sand and the corona in their left hand with that an umbrella in it all these different details so the idea is the hippocampus is not only important for putting new associations in mind that help you remember the events like this in your past - it will be in your past - but also important for putting new concepts together in unique ways the basis of both creativity and imagination so what we want to do - we have not done this - is to look at the effects of exercise not only on learning and memory but on increased creativity as well so what is the bottom line here the bottom line is simple increased aerobic exercise can improve learning memory and possibly creativity what is more to know and everybody wants a magic pill to get smarter well this is not a pills and it comes with a lot more sweat than a pills but it can help you it is free it helps you every day and our goal over the next ten years is trying to figure out exactly how that is helping you what exactly is changing in the brain so i only have one question for you who wants to go to the gym anybody okay great thank you'}\n",

we will be discussing but above all i want to share that i had the opportunity or rather the intention because i had the opportunity but i had the intention to study at the university i graduated as an enologist at an agricultural college which functioned in this great building and when one leaves these traditional tools those that we all know like primary school secondary school university master's degrees languages we sometimes realize that they are not enough when we enter the labor field we see that all these tools are very good very positive but they are not enough so my idea is to share some tools that i found more practical and that can help us tools that can help us to develop a business a life many things that we will be discussing and that will help us as we said all these tools are very good but we see that they are not enough so to organize this i want to make a small analogy of work or life in general with a journey what does this have to do with well we all have to be clear about many things whether the journey is short or long it does not matter we have to know where we are starting from what tools we have for the journey and we need to have a goal where we want to got many things may seem obvious and some speakers have already mentioned them but you will see that these obvious things are not always put into practice when it is time to act for example we need to know where we are where we want to got and how we plan for it for instance how do we plan for monday, how do we start monday, do we have it programmed analyzed and know what we will do this extends into the week the months the years our personal goals our work goals so i insist a lot on making the first analysis knowing exactly our starting point from there obviously the tools we need for the journey will emerge the tools we need to develop ourselves while all these traditional tools are good suddenly we can find many other tools in life that will help us progress one of the main tools is observing observe what observe the people around you to copy what they are doing well to take what you like from them and improve it adapt it to yourself these are all small things that will make us better and make things simpler and better the truth is that if you look around you will find a lot of people from parents friends colleagues all of them have something positive absolutely always you can learn something from them so it is very important to be an observer not just to see but to observe to copy and take the positive aspects also it is important to realize that we cannot surround ourselves with just anyone it may seem obvious but the truth is it is crucial to get closer to people who bring something positive who help us grow who complement us and distance ourselves from those who are negative who do not help who do not contribute make a small analysis of the people around you and you will see that by thinking positively there are many things you can learn and that you have not even noticed yet another typical thing especially as one starts to develop and grow is losing priorities it is fundamental to set priorities we all know examples the typical one who starts to do well and the first thing they do is buy a better care instead of capitalizing on their work it is important to have clear priorities and not lose them as we progress as the situation improves we must capitalize on our achievements and not rush into things another important thing is setting rules we all know we live in a country with many rules or at least many illogical rules but no one forces us to be stuck in that situation we can set our personal rules for example as the owner of my company i never do what i want i do not do what is best for me i do what is best for everyone this is a way of setting rules in the personal sphere in the business sphere we have certifications for several years we have had is certifications for commercialization and they help us stay organized and maintain a work line in a country that sometimes does not help in this sense instead of lamenting we can generate our own rules talking about travel there are many young people here i had the opportunity to play rugby and i got the chance to play in australia for a years and in italy for two years traveling is not easy today but there are endless opportunities and it is worth trying traveling generates personal growth and life experience that you cannot learn elsewhere it is a great way to learn languages and cultures if you get the chance choose wisely direct your efforts to places where you can gain the most like learning a new language finally having clear goals and dreams is essential it is crucial to have a great dream that motivates you no matter how big or small being convinced and determined will give you the strength to reach your goals with determination you can achieve whatever you want that is all thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 4: {'text': \"good morning let me tell you i am extremely excited to be here this morning i get the opportunity to stand before all of you and to tell you about the inspiration in my life organ and to tell you how she has played such a major role in my life in the lives of so many people who have special needs now before i get into all the details of that i want to back up a little bit and tell you how i got to this point as was mentioned i was in the home building business land development business started when i was 19 and really loved the business and had an opportunity for 21 years to really get the business to run exactly like i wanted it to i had an opportunity to get into the mortgage business title business all sorts of different businesses and then 2005 came and a company out of californium said we will not put you in retirement and if you remember back then business was really booming things were wild and crazy and the economy and so i said okay so i sold the companies and then i went from the day of running numerous companies to the point of then going okay what am i going to do in the second half of my life so many opportunities came to me i had an opportunity to get into different businesses reinvest in big ways and do some neat stuff but i also had the opportunity to take my daughter to school something i never had a chance to do i was able to go to organ's birthday parties and get to know her friends and talk to them and talk to parents he said let me tell you a little bit about organ organ just turned 18 years old but organ has special needs organ has a tough time adding two plus two she can get there but you got to work at it with her organ has a tough time reading a simple sentence she will get there but it is tough and she will get frustrated she will get upset at herself and wish she was someone else organ is someone who has 26 screws in her back and two rods and two hangers to allow her to stand up straight let me tell you what organ has it is more important than anything she has an attitude that is absolutely incredible every night when we put her to bed she has a smile on her face every morning she has a smile on her face she has gone through all these different obstacles and things but always keeps an attitude that is incredibly strong and so through that inspiration and the opportunity to talk and see more and understand more about the special needs community instead of all the opportunities that may exist from a business perspective i decided maybe the second half of my life she would be dedicated towards something else and that was all because of the inspiration and the attitude of this wonderful young lady now what does that mean well what i thought i had should do is build a foundation or form a foundation which i did and we do numerous things but one of the things that we wanted to do is we wanted to go out and build something or things as we were building the foundation that would be here for a long term would that be building medical facilities or different things in the community such as schools et that would be here long lasting to help the special needs community but then something happened about five years ago that really caused what i am here to talk about today and that is organ's wonderland you see we were on a family trip and organ loves to go swimming she does not really know how to swim like a and she is not real good at it but she loves to flap around in the water and do what kids do we went down to the pool at the hotel and it was late and day it was a smaller hotel a smaller pool and there were three kids at the other end of the pool and there were two of them were throwing a ball back and forth and organ and i were to pull i got out and organ i saw was slowly inching her way over and she wanted to play with those kids she could not tell him that she did not know how to really bring about that interaction so what happened is is organ started moving closer and closer she eventually hit the ball she got that close and the kids were looking at her like what are you doing organ just wanted to play what happened at that point is where this all happened those nice kids grabbed the ball and they all got out of the pool they got out of the pool because they did not know what it would be like to really explore the habit of the joy and the happiness of playing was someone who maybe could not verbally say exactly what she wanted but she would just like them in so many ways but because they did not understand that the interaction of play did not occur as organ turned around i saw her face and i thought to myself oh my god she just looked at me like i do not get it she did not say anything she went back i jumped in the pool we played i sat there and we did we continued on for a couple weeks i after that vacation i kept thinking about that turner organ's head to me and the look that she had and i have to tell you kept thinking about it thinking about it i said there is got to be a place that i can we can take organ to where everybody understands what is going on there in the element of play and there will be interaction between those who have special needs and those who do not have special needs i did not know what that meant so i thought well i will call some people i will go around look at different parks in the country just to see if there is something outside that we could replicate or take organ to or do something so somehow bring that barrier down to where the next time there are kids in that pool they will go hey come on over they will understand and that play will occur so i went around the country looking at a different place is that at least we are told that may be in line and nothing was closed what i found if anything had anything to tie with special needs that a lot of times it was off the beaten path it was not in the middle of everything else it was all kind of by itself and i said to myself let us do one of these in san anionic what is this i do not know what i am going to do i am just going to do it so i invited a bunch of people to a meeting to talk about the idea of building this part but and i just had a sheet of paper behind me that was basically white and i said i got this idea tell you what happened and we can do better nine invited doctors and therapists and teachers and people who have special needs and we all spent hours and hours and hundreds of people showed up i thought this is kind of cool because we do not really know what we are even gonna be talking about doll and they all showed up and we went over and we went over and over and talked about if we built this park with the theory of and the idea of trying to bring down that barrier what would be in it well what i heard was numerous things eight and a half pages of single tight ideas then i said okay what i want to do is i want to get outside the box i want to hire people to do this who have never done a part before i want to hire an architect who is never done a part before i wanted to hire an engineer who is never done a part before i want to hire graphics people have never done a part before because i am gonna be told by them how you are supposed to build a park and we are gonna be different this time so all these people who in did everything from organ's wonderland had never done it before that was the cool part what they had those some real grassroots ideas presented by people in the middle of it all the people who really work with special needs individuals on a daily basis and understand it and those who has special needs themselves what i heard more than anything was give us a place that is safe you see if i have a child who is autistic to go to the park is tough because you never know when that child might take a run would not we need to go to a park and know that somehow if that child did run that you could kind of relax for a little bit so when you go to organ's wonderland everybody gets an rid tag so we know exactly where they are at all times in the parking you can find them through any of the video screens that exist throughout the park the reason that exists is so that you can sit in if johnny runs off it is okay you can go find them you know exactly where he is and you will know everybody in your party within three seconds we brought that kind of technology and we also said not only do we want a safe place but we want a good environment we want an environment that is a little different does that mean well think about it if you are in a wheelchair and you go to these wonderful places do great job from an 88 perspective gives new world in all these places but the crowds and the time it might take to do something and impatience of people because they are not sometimes old at organ's women let us build a place that maybe could hold 4,500 or 5,000 people but let us not ever have more than about 1,500 or 2,000 in there this build it bigger so that the environment is one to where if you want to get on to a carousel and it takes longer because our carousel allows no matter what your physical or mental special need may be that we will allow you an opportunity to get on that carousel and if it takes ten minutes see if the culture of organ's wonderland it is okay we will help you and get you on that carousel and everybody is patient because that is what organ's wonderland is about there is no other carousel like the one at organ's wonderland there is no other offload adventure ride like the one at organ's wonderland there is no other train like the one that is at organ's wonderland these are not big magical ideas what we did basically at organ's wonderland i am so proud of the people who had never done this before but they said this look we are going to design a park for special needs but we are going to build it for everyone because when you walk into organ's wonderland it looks like any other park you do not see ramps and all that kind of stuff it is a place where you walk in and go i can play here know whether i have a special need or not but those who do have special needs they can do everything we take the most fragile children and adults those who are on ventilators those who sometimes unfortunately just have three days to live who say then the family says can they come over there and have an opportunity we had a child come to organ's wonderland that was three days before he died he had an opportunity he smiled he had that because he was able to do what he wanted to do and the family knew what he wanted to do and he could not have done it anywhere else in the world except that this unique part now as i talked earlier when i got to know organ's friends and families and stuff what i found out his morning was really one of the lucky ones you see organ has what she needs she has a physical therapist and the doctors and the and all that because i have been blessed to be able to give that to her but see i noticed that many times those with special needs do not have always all those economic opportunities to give their child are those who they care for what they really need so we made it early on and commitment that anyone who comes to organ's wonderland always comes for free always comes for free it does not matter we do not look it up in a book and define what special needs is if you say you have a special needs when you especially need when you come to the front you get in for free we figure if you lie about it you have a special need and so it is it is it is it is our approach saying we are here because we are gonna give you a break and we are gonna allow it the opportunity that if you want to come to this park thirty times a year you come to the park 30 times a year and you can ride to train seven times if you want to and we have some children who just stay on the train the whole time that is what they want that is that consistency is what they like at another place could they do that no no now through this entire process it is been amazing to see what has occurred i have to tell you a story about organ it kind of gives you a sense of what a place like this does i know what people he is asked me what does organ like to do when she goes to the park well at first all she would do is go on the swings we have 35 swings five different kinds whether you are in a wheelchair whatever your physical or mental special need maybe you can swing at organ's cornball organ we just go on the swings i see organ let us go on the carousel no shooing too close to it just scared of it all right let us go no let us go stand next to the carousel okay finally she did that then organ after a while eventually said i said organ let us just go and sit on an animal no okay finally she did that then we got her on an elephant could not can go just will sit on and then organ and then getting her off the elevator was in up thumb will go under but then the next time we went organ said we wanted to go to the carousel and when she went to the carousel now she would get on it and she would go one time real slow remember everybody else is in the park and enjoying the park with her at this point no pressure there is no pressure it is just simply but here's the neat thing organ now when she goes to the park goes to the carousel first and rides it on her own okay well why is that a big deal well organ now when she finishes the first time she looked at me said are you proud of me dad yeah and that is what happens at organ's wonderland you take a child who it seems like a small thing to write on a care so that is a big deal little things are big things and at organ's wonderland through play they learn they learn that they have the opportunity to achieve something just as even if it is a small thing just riding a carousel organ does not want me near the carousel when she rides now because she does not independently and it is taught her something and on the 26 different attractions that fit in this thirty-five million dollar park ultra accessible park it gives opportunities to thousands tens of thousands and i am happy to say over two hundred thousand people in such a short period have already been through the park not just from here matter of fact one out of two people who come to spark going come from this area they come from outside here they come from outside this the state they come from outside this country thirty four different countries have been represented at organ's wonderland already and here's the neat thing we do not have a marketing budget it is all done by word of mouth because those who have special needs and those who are caregivers and those who are involved in this whole thing are really tight-knit people and they are starving for something like this i did not know that at first i knew they were but i did after i had that first meeting where my said yeah there is something here but what was the neatest thing about that meeting is once that happened and started is that how this community and the community even outside the city all joined together you see we just started this idea in 2007 when we actually started thinking let us talk about this we finished it thirty nine months later we raised almost all the money we are about five six million dollars short of raising all the 435 million dollars but we did it because of passionate people who came together quickly and said the time has been too long for something like this remember five and a half percent of population requires assistance every day or they cannot make it through there there is fifteen percent of the population is special-needs we are not talking from a million people we are talking 50 million people in this country who are special need it is a big big number and we are just scratching your surface since we do not have a marketing budget it is word of mouth but we are seeing people come from all over and finding always make a wish we are one the top locations for make-a-wish people come here because this is a place they can go anywhere but organ's wonderland is special it is a special place for our special friends and for all those it is not just about the special needs in the video though it is about everybody being able to play together three out of four people who come to more is where i do not have a special need you see they join in with those who have especially and it brings down that barrier that happened in that pool because then that child who is 21 years old who has the mental capacity of a five year old who is playing in that sand circle feels very comfortable and he is got eight year old and twelve year old playing right around him and that brings down that barrier and that allows him who could go nowhere else and playing a fan circle the opportunity to do that but do it in an environment that he loves a place that he feels safe his family feels comfortable and everybody is working in conjunction for the element of inclusion that is organ's wonderland that is organ's one life now when you let people a lot of them in for free and you put on a lot of free things you do not you are not going to make money that is what organ's wonderland is not about it is not about selling tickets it is about offering a service now how did you do that well i wanted to put something together working with a lot of wonderful people that would would do two things one being economics and one being about explaining that whole element of inclusion and that is next to organ's wonderland is a seventy-five acres soccer park so people always ask me i do not get it cordon soccer especially i do not get it soccer plays a big role why soccer well on what in our thoughts and my feeling about all this is that we need to bring something to san anionic and there is a sport in san anionic that i did not feel was really being properly dealt with from the standpoint of giving quality facilities to and that was soccer so why do not we take something help the overall community tie it next door to a special needs a part that is for those with special needs in the entire community so when thousands of people come and play soccer on these four of 14 different fields they will get that and ask the question what is it and then it will bring awareness you think it brings awareness so you do something good with your community you bring awareness but then you do another thing we rent those fields into renting these top-quality fields we bring money over to organ's wonderland to help with the operations of it it is incredible you can go there and see 7,000 people on a weekend play soccer on these fields when these big tournaments go and these tournaments do not just come from san anionic this region they come from around the state and around the country but when they come here they learn they learn and it brings the exposure up of those who have special needs in the idea of inclusion so let us take it one step further last year we bought a pro soccer team and we are bringing it to san anionic they will start play they will start playing in six months across the street from organ's woodland but then there is going to be a community stadium built right across the street from organ's water line and so through that through the scorpions through all the different events that occur in this community stadium that is being built all with private funds what will ultimately happen is we will bring hundreds of thousands of people and through the most popular sport in the world every time that team travels around north america competing it will be able to talk about soccer but it will also be able to talk about organ's wonderland what is foreland it is a place of inclusion we all bring people together so it plays a revenue source because money from that will ultimately go to organ's winner oil 100% but it will also bring awareness to what it is all about so organ's wonderland is not just the sticks and bricks to me it is about a movement it is about an approach of being able to do something different it is about the idea of saying the time is now to get outside the box let me in was one little thought i get letters and emails from people all the time basically daily telling me about organ's wonderland i love reading him but i got one the other day i want to share with you and it is this lady who this young lady who was leaving with her daughter who was autistic and as they were walking out to the car the young daughter said mom did we just leave heaven and when she told me that i thought to myself we have got a little heaven here on earth at organ's one life thank you very much the opportunity\"}\n",
      "Resultado 5: {'text': \"all right hello so i have had a lifelong fascination with how we organize how we humans work together to express some work or some purpose in the world and i would like to start by sharing a story bit about my journey it is a story that is true and it is become a bit of a metaphor for my own my own path i have a private a harrowing experience pilot's license and when i was first learning to fly i had a rather harrowing experience i am up in the plane i am still a student pilot i have 20-some hours of flight time i yes they let you fly a plane alone with 20-some hours of practice so i am up in this plane it is my first cross-country solo flight so the first time i am flying hundreds of miles away from home with no instructor with me and i am all ready for the journey i go up i start flying little nervous and the low voltage light comes on they do not teach you much about how the plane works right barely not apply the thing so you know what do i do well my first instinct is to you know tap the low voltage light but that does not change anything my next instinct is to check my other instruments to see if there is a big problem here right so one by one i check all of my other instruments the altimeter says you are not losing altitude there is nothing wrong all right the navigation aid says you are perfectly on course congratulations everything's fine the airspeed indicator says you are not losing speed you are flying fast everything's great so i let those other instruments outvote the low voltage light yeah i figured nothing else is reporting anything anomalous it must not be that big of a problem right that was a really bad idea turns out who would have thought that low voltage light is actually tuned in to different information than every other instrument on that control panel oops i nearly crashed the plane that day and fortunately i did make it down there were some steps in the middle there i will skip for you but i made it down and after the adrenaline wears off it occurs to me we do this in our organizations all the time when we humans show up in organizations we become the sensors the instruments for that organizations flight towards its purpose we sense reality on its behalf it is through us that it becomes aware of whatever it needs to deal with or do in the world and we humans are different and we sense different things we have different talents backgrounds different types different talents we sense different things and it is sometimes something sensed by only one person or by the many minority that is critical to integrate into how we proceed and we often ignore them and this really echoed my experience back when i worked in more conventional organizations that was my experience i showed up in a company i wanted to be a sensor for this company i wanted to be an instrument i sensed reality and i wanted to do something with it and i am sure all of you have had the experience of going into some organization somewhere and sensing something important maybe it is a hole in a process or a way to improve something that is not working as well as it could be something slipping through the cracks and i would often have those experiences but have nothing i could do to act on them right there would be no way to integrate that into the organization in fact i no way to integrate learned early on that if the boss did not sense it i was not gonna get it processed have you ever seen that you know you sense something important but the boss just does not see it good luck that shuts down the organization's capacity to integrate and harness whatever it was that i tuned in to find the low-voltage light were in trouble so my quest since then has been how can we humans show up as sensors for our organizations and i did the only logical thing i was i became a boss this is more personal now how can i show up and to be a sensor for organization the only logical thing once i realized that anything i sensed that the boss did not was not gonna get address well i became a boss right that is nice and simple now i get to really run things the way i think they should be you know and unfortunately i realized there was still another boss you know so after climbing the corporate ladder a bit i got fed up with that and realized all right the only way i am really going to be able to process anything my sense is if i drop out of this whole game and start my own company where i get to be the coo at the top and now there is no boss getting in the way of processing whatever it is i am sensing so i did that i started a software company and built it over many years and you know at first that worked great i could get a lot of the stuff i sensed processed but then something unfortunate happened i realized well i am not even able to even as the coo as this company's growing i am not even able to take everything that i see and get it processed the systems are not responsive enough right the way we have structured and built our organizations today does not let me even as the coo get everything i sense integrated and harnessed and processed and that was not actually the worst of it the far more painful realization was i had just built the very system that i had struggled so long and tried to move past right now everyone else in that company did not get whatever it was that they could tune into and sense harnessed and integrated unless i saw it and no matter how much i might work on myself focus on my own development try to be the most empowering servant leader i can be the reality is i am still a human i still have bad days i still miss things right and i had built the very system that i had tried to escape so my question then shifted a bit it became how do i build something different and how do i build a system where that is not the case where anything since by anyone can integrate and change the organization to help it better express whatever work it is doing in the world so one of the things we attention realized is there is incredible energy there in the things we sense when we tune in to a gap between where we are and what could be right we call this attention because we often sense it as tension right that it is not just intellectual it is that feeling in your gut the frustration that comes when you see a process that you know could be better or you are banging your head into the same damn problem multiple times you feel tense you feel this tension about it could also be an opportunity if something exciting but it is this gap between where we are and where you sense we could be and just like a rubber band stretched between two points there is such energy there although we often tension experience it as a negative i do not mean it that way at all and if we can do something with it becomes energy not frustration right the root of the word tension in satin tense era means to stretch it is a stretch so how can we power an organization fuel its continual evolution its continual updating how it works and how we work together based on these tensions that we sense so interesting question hard thing to do and we tried a lot of things so we experimented over years we tried running an organization via consensus seemed like a good idea at the time it was a complete disaster if you ever want to sit in long painful meetings all the time and never get anything done try running your organization with consensus what i realized was there is a consensus big difference between having a voice and actually being able to do something with your voice being able to actually process everything you sense into some kind of meaningful change consensus did not do it in fact often that would result in long painful meetings where we all tried to get everyone to see it the same way i do not want my low voltage light to have to see things the same way as my fuel gauge i do not need that and it is not a healthy system in fact i want to let each of them sense what they can sense best and all integrate into the flight plan so how can we have an organization where any tension sense by anyone anywhere in the company has someplace to go to get rapidly and reliably processed into meaningful change that was the question consensus did not work so we tried other things and we started finding approaches we started coming up with something and one of the first things we realized on that journey is we actually need to harness autocratic harness autocratic authority the very thing we moved away from in the beginning right autocratic authority because if we are sensing on behalf of the organization and we want to be dynamic and fast and responsive which we have to be to process everything everyone senses most of the things we sense we need to act on locally we need to be not just sensors but actors in this system and to do that we need the authority to act without having to go to a painful meeting and try to get everybody bought into every decision you want to make in cells in the human body other words we need to be a lot more like cells in the human body each one needs a clear boundary within which it has autonomy that has authority but what you do not see is a coo cell right a manager cell directing the others what to do each cell has its own autonomy but it is distributed that is the direction we moved in a system where everybody has autocratic authority but they know the bounds of their authority they know the interconnections they know when they have to get somebody ease's input or when they have to integrate with someone they know the bounds of their authority and the connections they know what they the process can expect of each other and in most organizations we have managers to fill the central point to do that to align all of us and to distribute authority but we have already covered the limits of that so how can we do that without managers in the way well for that we need a process if we do not have managers to align and integrate we need a process which aligns and integrates a process which lets each of us be a sovereign autonomous agent on behalf of this organization and its purpose and integrate in other words we need something that is a lot less like a feudal hierarchy and a lot more like a constitutional entity and that is exactly what we have so in my organization i work in every day i get to experience this it is quite liberating in my organization now we have no coo we have no managers every individual partner in that firm has real authority that no one else can trump but it is distributed we each have different authority and we know the bounds and the limits of each and we have a constitution that defines how we integrate together a constitution that defines a governance process which is not governed of the people by the people for the people but rather is governance of the organization through the people as sensors for the purpose whatever it is we are here to do together when we have that kind of tangible system real processes that hold and distribute real authority and integrate us and figure out how do we need to interconnect and align expectations when that process allows everyone to have a voice for the sake of the purpose and when you have a process to integrate anything you sense conclusion anything you sense whatsoever any constraint on expressing this this purpose in the world and you can integrate it and change and reshape the organization dynamically in real time reshape how we work together what authority everyone has you have got a system that is dramatically more responsive and adaptable without the waste of managers in the way limiting what tensions you can process all of this we have captured in what we call a new social technology for organizations it is a new operating system it is tangible that constitutions available on our website and you can find it you can find organizations running with it all over the world now it is spreading is called holacracy you can find more at our website holacracy or and learn a bit more about how this system aligns us to each to the purpose each of us to the purpose while giving us the freedom and autonomy and yet an integrated whole thank you\"}\n"

myself i could be a consultant i am going to go gluten free right after i eat that last piece of chocolate cake laughter you know one day i am going to stand up to that crabby boss i look good on paper i should feel great i just know there is more you know it because you feel it you lie awake at night you talk about your dreams with your partner and your friends but more often than not you continue to do those same behaviors that keep you from making the change you ask yourself how can i make it happened research shows the odds against you making a change in your life i i 9 to 1. 9 to i even if you are facing a life-threatening illness but let me show you how to beat those odds you can live the life you desire it is right there in front of you but in order to achieve it you must first see it then believe it and then you must graciously ask and train your brain to help you execute your vision so how do we see our vision through a picture a picture can create movement a picture... can unite nations a picture can pull at your heart and fill you with a deep desire to do something at rochet pharmaceutical the president asked us to create a picture of his vision prior to having one less than 40 percent of the employees understood the company's vision and strategy after seeing this picture 96 percent understood it and 84 percent understood how what they did everyday align to that picture so how can you use a picture to get what you want by simply drawing one you do not have to be an artist or know how to draw as naive as your drawings might be when you draw where you are your current state and where you want to be your desired new reality suddenly you have a road map for change so what is your current state well let us say you are joey job has a good job job has a lovely wife amyl job makes good money but like many of us job wants more from life and he would like to get rid of a couple of things maybe that intense workload maybe that negative boss maybe job has a higher purpose he is just not sure how to get there so now job's current state is visual we remember things better when they are attached to a picture 65 percent better to be exact so now let us imagine that job wants to change something in his current state he wants to build that desired new reality that he dreams about in order for job to freely dream he must first... ...trick his brain because the left side of your brain as you know houses the critics who is forever trying to keep you safe from harm make sure you do not do anything dangerous or stupid so let us have job tell the critic that he is just going to use his imagination using your imagination activates the right side of your brain which makes you creative and filled with possibility so now let us dream job's new life in the best case scenario one year from today what is job's life like hey job has a new job great job has a new boss himself job has a couple of great collaborators and job is just bursting with creativity and ideas and all of those things we dream about connection and purpose and freedom and love now i am drawing this picture as the favor to job today but in real life he would have to draw his own picture because he cannot afford me laughter actually because you get the most power when you paint your own picture so now job has his drawing so now he is got to soak it in he has to fill it with color he has to fill it with emotions he has to get inside of it as if he is on the inside looking out your brain actually emits serotonin and oxytocin when you draw and dream so you feel happy capable creative you feel cool so now we have job's current state and job's desired new reality so how can job get from here to there in just three bold steps three bold steps if i knew how to get from here to there in three bold steps i would have done it 25 years ago when i had a mullet laughter here is where the magic begins your brain knows you it is cataloged everything you have ever seen heard experienced real or imagined you just have to ask it to put the pieces together for you it as simple as that we live in a three-dimensional world but the light falls on the retina in a two-dimensional fashion and the brain it has to cope with it so how does it deal with this extra dimension it guesses it guesses and just as it can guess where your cup of coffee is when it goes to pick it up it can correctly guess what the three bold steps are that you should take all you have to do is look at your picture and then close your eyes this allows the brain to recycle what it sees and reconstruct it add to it everything you have ever seen heard experienced or fantasized about and then it will serve you up with the best possible solution if you just relax and you ask it now what is the boldest thing i could do to get from here to there boom immediately it will tell you see it believe it act on it now the danger is if any of those three bold steps are too scary this instinctual rational side of your brain is going to try to talk you out of this oh not not not i do not want to do that... oh that desk it is not too small my legs are not cramped under there oh 20,000 a years oh that is a decent salary oh that boss he is not that mean to me you know what i am just going to stay right here i feel really comfortable here so how can you get yourself to do the boldest thing by drawing the most compelling picture so when you look here you are in pain it hurts when you are here you are ecstatic it is fantastic you are already living inside that connected and free life you drew so everyday you get up you soak in your picture you step into the possibility and this is the most important part you act on it you do one small thing you call up that friend you know who started her own business you ask her how did you do it you ask amyl will you support me in my vision you go to your boss and you ask him for a raise and you become that one person out of ten to make change happen now i put this template on your chairs so that you can do for yourself what i just did for joey you have seen some fantastic ideas today that have inspired your dream i dare you to draw that dream into that template i double dare you to choose a symbol in your drawing that represents that desired new reality take a picture of it with your phone and send it to us at tedxrainier. maya angel said a solitary fantasy can transform a million realities just three bold steps can transform one reality yours thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 2: {'text': \"what keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life if you were going to invest now in your future best self where would you put your time and your energy there was a recent survey of millennial asking them what their most important life goals were and over 80 % said that a major life goal for them was to get rich and another 50 % of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous and we are constantly told to lean in to work to push harder and achieve more we are given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them those pictures are almost impossible to get most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but 2020. we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative but what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study many people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy we did that the hazard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that is ever been done for 75 years we have tracked the lives of 724 men year after years asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball further down the field but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived about 60 of our original 724 men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s. and we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men and i am the fourth director of the study since 1938, we have tracked the lives of two groups of men the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at hazard college they all finished college during world war i and then most went off to serve in the war and the second group that we have followed was a group of boys from button's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boson of the 1930s. most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed they were given medical exams we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top and some made that journey in the opposite direction the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today 75 years later telling you that the study still continues every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives many of the inner city boson men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just is not that interesting the hazard men never ask that question to get the clearest picture of these lives we do not just send them questionnaires we interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records from their doctors we draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said it is about time so what have we learned what are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we have generated on these lives well the lessons are not about wealth or fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get from this 75 year study is this good relationships keep us happier and healthier period we have learned three big lessons about relationships the first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier they are physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five america will report that they are lonely and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that it is not just the number of friends you have and it is not whether or not you are in a committed relationship but it is the quality of your close relationships that matters it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health high conflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective once we had followed our men all all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who was not and when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it was not their middle'-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old it was how satisfied they were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men and women reported in their is that on the days when they had more physical pain their moods stayed just as happy but the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain and the third big lesson that we learn about relationships on our health is that good relationships do not just protect our bodies they protect our brains it turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your is is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those people's memories stay sharper longer and the people in relationships where they feel they really cannot count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier memory decline and those good relationships they do not have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments did not take a toll on their memories so this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well'-being, this is wisdom that is as old as the hills why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore well we are human what we would really like is a quick fix something we can get that will make our lives good and keep them that way relationships are messy and they are complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends that is not sexy or glamorous it is also lifelong it never ends the people in our 75'-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates just like the millennial in that recent survey many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life but over and over over these 75 years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let us say you are 25 or you are 40 or you are 60. what might leaning into relationships even look like well the possibilities are practically endless it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member who you have not spoken to in years because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges i would like to close with a quote from mark twain more than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this there is not time so brief is life for bickering apologies heart burnings callings to account there is only time for loving but an instant so to speak for that the good life is built with good relationships thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 3: {'text': \"i am here to help you do even more unzipping of your minds and of your hearts moxie clay came out here and challenged your expectations and i am going to ask you to unzip and let your expectations fall out and push them aside all together because they are holding you back expectations are those lists of things what are expectations we build up that tell us how things should be they keep us feeling safe and they also often prevent us from being fully present in our lives and from living to our highest potential so i am going to tell you about my journey away from expectation which also turned out to be a journey toward self empowerment and hope and then how it might apply to your relationships as well i first learned about the power of letting go of expectation on my journey back to my natural family my birth family i am adopted and my adoption is a fairly standard post world war two story in great brain my natural parents live next door to each other in a small town near the east coast of scotland and when they finished high school they went to the west of scotland to glasgow a whopping 38 miles away my father went to heathers story glasgow university my mother went to nursing school and when she became pregnant they decided they were going to get married but they were going to wait and tell their families when they went home on christian break so they expected to end that year by becoming a family that was remember 1966 what they got instead was a tearful break up outside my father's garage from my mother that was followed by a stay at a mothering home a daughter who left the hospital before she did a bill for my foster care and ultimately my adoption my father paid penance by working as a bricklayer for a year before he to university in edinburgh they never saw each other again whatever expectations they had were letting go of expectations shattered on top of that they were told that they should be grateful privileged that they had a chance to redeem themselves and move on this is all pretty standard stuff for that time in place and i am telling you this because i want to note that although my parents learned not to expect in the wake of our separation this is not the productive kind of letting go the kind of letting go that they learned is rooted in shame and in punishment there is not any hope in it it is about shutting down and what i would like us to do today is learn how to let go and open up so fast-forward 18 years from that tearful breakup in the garage my adoptive father my dad had made it clear that he would totally understand if i wanted to go and find my natural family this is a lot easier in scotland than it is here they do not alter birth certificates the adoptee has the rights to all the records so i took myself off to the house of records in edinburgh and got hold of my birth certificate it had my birth name my mother's name her then address it took me another 18 years to decide to search the lead up to that would take another tedtalk or two mostly something had shifted inside me on a trip back in 2003 i walked past the house listed on the birth certificate and i just could not let it go after that i was led entirely by my gut i kind of had to be adoptee are less than i of the population only a few of assert and only a fraction of the people who search actually wind up being in reunion there are not enough of us for there to be a guidebook and for me this turned out to be a good thing it did help that i had had my own child my first child in somewhat similar circumstances to my own birth it also helped that i knew two other friends who were adoptee who were in reunion they had gone into the reunion with a litany of expectations one friend was in a relationship with her natural father that could best be termed as clandestine the other friend's father drank himself into ice the first time they met their relationships with all their natural families were fraught to say the least so i went in with an awareness of the letting go of hope risks i looked clearly at the risks and i decided to go ahead i went in also trying to pare back to what i really hoped without the expectation and what i hoped was to find my natural mother i wanted to know where i came from yes part of me did want the opah style reunion you know the one where you go and the whole gigantic attractive successful natural family welcomes the adoptee on whom they have been waiting their whole lives but i did not go expecting it i pared back and back to what was driving the hope i knew i had to hang on to that i knew i had to be whole and i had to expect nothing when i felt ready to do that i contacted birth link in scotland this is a nonprofit agency that helps adoptee and their families connect with each other i put my name on the list for a searcher that takes some months so in the waiting time i searched more deeply within myself i asked myself all kinds of odd questions what would i do if i found my mother and she was dying and needed my help what would i make of it if i found her and she was alcoholic obese if she was destitute a retired prostitute and i realized that anything that would bother me deeply would do so because i already saw it as a weakness in myself in other words anything i might want her to change was really something i wanted to change in myself i believe this is also called owning your own stuff owning your own stuff also talk to my brother he is also adopted and he said look heather the only thing you really have to worry about is if you go to meet her and she comes to the door with her bags packed and goes alright darling we are we going cut she thinks she is moving in with you anything else you can just run away from start is often good for a little bit of comedy with some truth embedded and he was right either one of us could end the relationship at any moment and is not that the case with all our relationships we behave as though in our relationships especially our significant ones we behave as though we are operating with some kind of a relationship union like a pipe fitters union that is going to uphold our expectation contract but the truth is relationships live in a right-to-work state any party and sometimes a third party like sudden death can end the contract with no notice and no cause and that is a scary truth to face but as with any other no guidebook truth all the expectation in the world cannot stop it what i knew what my net natural parents and i had lived for nearly four decades before we came face-to-face is that expectation does not guarantee you a thing so i entered the relationship knowing the risks i entered the relationship owning what i brought i entered the relationship without that guidebook and here's the good thing about there not being a guidebook there are not any articles about what a good reunion looks like like the articles you read that imply that all the other married couples have more sex than you the skinny woman next door eats cherry pie for breakfast the other guy's business makes more money than yours and it is more fun to work there all the things that build up our expectations and they record chances of honoring what is right in front of us so when i entered the relationship in this rest in way what i found that i was able to really rest in and notice small moments and to take joy there i noticed for instance the grain of my mother's freckled hand wrapped around her mug of tea the first time we met i got to experience her with the surest sureness of adulthood and the heart of a child i did not have my expectation checklist running through my head that is what expectations do they tend to run through our head act like a third party in our relationship constantly vying for our attention and that feels okay when things match up but even then we have stepped away from the moment and the relationship to check in with them and when things do not measure up then we really go aside we start talking to expectation asking it for affirmation he should have brought me flowers should not he she should run those meetings on time and our expectation list says oh yes honey you are right get back in there and make them do it your way so you keep asking and asking and getting grumpier and grumpier when things do not measure up if you have asked a couple of times and you have not gotten the response you wanted you are probably not going to get it and in that stepping away to measure up with expectation you have missed the moment and the relationship as it unfolded that might have offered a path forward and even when the worst thing happens when your expectations are not met and another path forward is not on offer you are then resting in the truth and you can choose to move yourself forward from the truth of that relationship in that moment expectation does not stop painful stuff from happening it just blames it on somebody else what expectations do is pull us out of the moment they hold us in an infinite loop of false possibility so i challenge you today to free yourself from this loop of false possibility before you leave this building this afternoon think of one relationship that has one unfulfilled expectation in it let the expectation go search yourself own your stuff commit to entering your next interaction in that relationship without the expectation hanging on to some hope and then just allowing yourself to fully rest in the reality of the moment whatever needs or wants you might have it is possible that those can be met in some other way but not by this person at this moment settle your heart to that and then move yourself forward i think you will find that if you can be brave enough to rest in reality human and flawed and possibly beautiful reality it will take you places better than you have ever dared to expect\"}\n",

hence all the different mes - but it also gave me super antennas for the emotions of others this hypervigilance made me a certified mess of a person but a damn near-wizard-level observer so i got to work the last 20 years have shadowed people in their homes at their jobs while they shop and drive and go on dates i ask them to be honest and vulnerable with me and to do this i practice something that i call unconditional welcome which is like a researchers neutrality but a little extra the day i discovered it i was sitting in the living room of a research subject she was a very unpleasant woman if ism honest feeding french fries to an infant as she snapped at me that she would never have her children vaccinated not even to protect them from polio because she did not know it was in those shots now never mind that she said this an inch of ash deep into a virgin slim right laughter i was judging her i know ism not proud of it but at least one of me is a jerk laughter i needed to connect with her and i did not want to i did not like her i did not respect her i did not want to spend a single moment with her and the project required that i spend hours and that i used that time to get to know her what she values what she believes where she finds strength researcher neutrality was unavailable to me at the time so i had to get out the big guns i called up my new age visualization skills and i took a deep breath secondhand smoke and all and i imagined that my breath was inflating a shiny soap bubble filled with unconditional welcome not tolerance not even compassion total welcome as is - no comments no notes and as i inflated the bubble it became big enough to contain my whole body and then hers and in that moment i saw a mother feeding her baby in a world that she did not trust i told her that i could see that she cared about protecting her son and i asked her if she got that from her parents and then we had a conversation and i learned about her i learned why she was afraid and angry and how she fought through that fear to make a family when i welcomed this woman unconditionally i saw her more clearly but i also loved her instantly we have been told too often that love is hard it is not love is what happens when we stop trying to figure out who deserves it it is right there when we stop trying to figure out who deserves it and we welcome someone anyone exactly as they are in the moment it will be two more years before i learn to do this with all the parts of myself but it started just as simply a part of me had become very chatty - a part that was afraid and angry whiny demanding unreasonable and relentless she told me that we were never going to get better she wanted out of here i asked her what i could do she only told me she wanted to die over and over and over and over i begged her to shut up and she did not finally after weeks of harassment whether out of exhaustion or epiphany instead of shouting back i took a deep breath i became my own moderator i said out loud in a voice that surprised me thank you for sharing ism going to remind you of our agreement to be honest and reasonable and she answered me - that voice now do not get spooked this is all just thinking happening laughter but the part of me asking and the part answering did in fact seem like different parts she told me that she was in a lot of pain and i told her i know and i promise you ism going to take care of you but i need you to get on board i will listen to you but i will not obey you and as clearly as ism speaking to you now she said okay and then we started to talk as i continue the dialogue with myself i found more of me more voices with more points of view some of them more fun than others and the imagined landscape of my mind began to look a lot like a focus group this round table of wildly mixed characters and one moderator keeping some kind of order with honesty boundaries kindness and most importantly gratitude i thank my selves for their contributions no matter how bonkers or twisted they may seems because were all me i think of my fragmented self less like broken mirror and more like a prism were full spectrum today there is not a voice in my head that i do not welcome and while some of us are occasionally unreasonable were not mean even my whiny shame voice is trying to help in her weird way but when i ask her to be clear and kind she tells me exactly what i need to know what she needs to feel better and what she would like for me to learn but just like the scared and angry mother she only does this when i accept her exactly as she is in the moment so while my openings for self-talk and focus groups sound almost identical the closings are a little different at the round table i would hand out parking validation remind everyone to sign for their cash but when ism with all of me i say i love you thank you for helping me see what you see - which is why this practice is so useful for all of us here with our different perspectives inside and outside of one another if we can receive one another with the curiosity and welcome of a focus group moderator perhaps we can do a better job of love because it is not true what they say that you cannot love anyone until you love yourself love is a house you can crawl in through a window if you cannot start with yourself start with the person next to you right now whether you know them or not all you have to do is let them be here it is easy is not it wherever they have been whatever they are carrying whatever talents they have or do not have whatever mistakes they have made can you just welcome them here can you welcome you were here right now like this were beautiful and strange and complicated and scared and sometimes kind of horrible but all of us are worthy of welcome and everyone that you show unconditional welcome may show you a part of yourself to love you are welcome thank you'}\n",
      "Resultado 5: {'text': \"early in my life i learned that there was one thing that could kill a festive mood at a dinner party and that was to talk about me to talk about my life my life as the daughter of a cult leader there was very little that was joking or lighthearted about the first 28 years of my life so i avoided that topic at all costs it was too painful nobody could understand so i became a master at diverting attention at during the conversation on to somebody else but not me i so rarely talked about my life that on the rare occasion when i would slip and somebody would kind of push for me to divulge i could not just casually and comfortably share it i would bond with the story and it would go something like this well i grew up outside of chico and my dad pastured actually a wonderful church there that through the years evolved into a 15,000 member cult it operated and it still operates under the guise of an independent fundamental baptist church but those who have left the followers have tried to leave outsiders even the media it was on 20/20 last year recognize that it is clearly a cult every member was in complete obedience father they did not dare disagree or be disloyal for fear of being publicly ridiculed or punished or banished for doing so they did not go on a vacation without asking my dad's permission and he had said they drink the kool-aid i am not kidding they would have my dad lived a double life one of righteous family man and dynamic speaker in the public eye but one of sordid sexual secrets privately secrets that only my siblings and me and my mom knew he hated my mom hated her treated her terribly abused her and even turned his own children against our mother we hated her he told us she was crazy we thought to make him happy we would hate her too our home was felt full of turmoil hatred stress strife and as a little girl it was isolating it was intense and it was frightening he had affairs had a mistress for many years the wife of a sunday-school teacher built her family a beautiful home right around the corner from our house you could see their family from our back door it was it was craziness living one way preaching another my brother my older brother he became another version of my father he took a he pastured a church in texts was found to have been having affairs with 14 different women divorced that current wife married one of the 14 my father tried desperately to cover it up moved into another church where he was found to have had 17 there was with different women and he just recreated what he had seen my dad with and my dad did nothing but cover it up i felt like i had one main responsibility as a child it was simple but daunting and that was to keep all the secrets there were so many you see he had taught us that the best way to please god was to please him because he was god's man and he taught us that to please him we had to keep all the secrets we could not even tell our best friends what went on in our home because we might be the causes for the destruction of his ministry i literally feared my very life if i ever talked about my dad's ministry but what went on in our home for fear that it would hurt his ministry i was so afraid and the greater the secrets the greater the fear and the greed of my determination to keep quiet i gotta tell you the money part of it was pretty nice as a kid i mean think about it tithes and offerings from 50,000 people know it created a lavish lifestyle for our family my father owned most of the city where the church was he owned to college to high schools to great schools a cemetery blocks of buildings he was very wealthy and even into our adult years he owned us he owned our homes our cars our furniture he owned our lives and we did not dare cross him because we were to her whose everything he died a multimillionaire he left nothing to his children he left everything to the organization which my younger sister and her husband now need and they still perpetuate his legacy the strict rules the undying loyalty and they still try to keep all the secrets i never understood why was i the only one that the four kids so tortured by the hypocrisy so disturbed by the mind control over thousands and thousands of people and so determined to find a better life why was i the only one that insisted on answers to my questions and why was i the only one that ultimately broke away and cut ties with the brainwashing the oppression the fear the secrets and the life that had never been my life i finally walked away when i was about 28 years of age then being estranged from my entire family and i did not see my family again until many years later at my dad's funeral okay see what i mean not a story to share at a dinner party i really got to the point after i left dinner that i could not talk about me for one thing who would understand for another thing it was too hard it hurt too bad so i made a mental note and permanent marker that said must never talk about my life and for many years i did not i could not however wonderful things had happened through the years since their therapy a lot of therapy deprogramming freedom from the mind control and i began to heal and learn and accept and forgive and even learn to be thankful that bizarre life that i had because i realized i was learning some amazing lessons from not only being there but from having the guts to leave and i now have values that are deeply carved in my very soul from that instead of these you do not get for reading a book or from a workshop or another person bellies that are only this deeply ingrained when you live what i live because my dad was a cult leader i now embrace three values and no one will ever take these away from me the first one is freedom to explore my own interests freedom to live within my own value system freedom to determine my own value system freedom to believe what i believe and never stifle what i believe freedom to disagree for you to ask questions and require honest answers freedom to learn who i am and freedom to love who i am the second value was truth i learned pretty quickly that i was not going to be very free until i dealt with what was true and that was hard for me truth was a scary word for me because i mean my entire life i had never been allowed to speak of what went on in our home i had never told even my best friends what went on in our house being truthful was one of the scariest things i could think of i learned that secrets grown in the dark but when exposed to the light of truth they start to lose their power many person my dear amazing therapist in callas texts who nurtured me and who loved me through years and years of healing she used to say to me kinda you are only as sick as your secrets you are only as sick as your secrets so i stopped keeping secrets and as scared as i was in my late is i finally began to deal with what was true i think it finally began to speak what was true and eventually learned how to live openly only in truth and the third value is courage did you know that you actually cannot have freedom or truth if you have no courage is a requirement for both you may desire to live in complete free and the complete truth but if you are lacking and courage you will live in neither one in my late is i had a tiny shred of courage not much but it was all i needed because my desire to live and be free and honest was somewhat great but that teeny shred of courage that i had was enough to allow me to walk away i have a plaque on my desk that i have had for years and it is gone with me everywhere i have ever moved it says the secret to happiness is freedom and the secrets of freedom is courage and that resonated with me i knew it was not going to be happy unless i was free but i knew i was not going to be free my second some courage to get out of there i had to cling to and act upon that tiny shred of courage in order to finally leave a cult the only friends i never know my childhood connections my history my family knowing that in doing so i finally have what i had longed for my entire life and that was freedom true freedom truth courage three words that maybe kind of trite and overused to some people to me they are the air that i breathe values upon which i insist on living and loving in my life oh and one other thing i actually know about you sharing my story talking about me i now recognize that it is in sharing my story and i can so passionately share with you my values gained over 28 years not an emotional prison that kept my heart under lock and key and kept my mind for knowing what i knew you know i sometimes wonder if perhaps living in the absence of our values is what can most clearly determine what indeed our values are and for me i really believe that the apes and the denial of created the presence of for so many years i was denied freedom truth and courage and now i will never let them go not to worry you are still not going to find me at a dinner party he is talking about my childhood not going to happen you will not find me sitting around elaborating over my father who took a wonderful church and turn it into a fifty thousand member cult i still know that is a mood killer i get it but you will find me here and in other appropriate settings especially if i can help somebody talking about my life with sincere gratitude for all that i have learned in spite of and because of living in the absence of freedom truth and courage and thank god i now have by now you\"}\n"

      "Resultado 1: {'text': \"what keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life if you were going to invest now in your future best self where would you put your time and your energy there was a recent survey of millennial asking them what their most important life goals were and over 80 % said that a major life goal for them was to get rich and another 50 % of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous and we are constantly told to lean in to work to push harder and achieve more we are given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them those pictures are almost impossible to get most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but 2020. we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative but what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study many people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy we did that the hazard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that is ever been done for 75 years we have tracked the lives of 724 men year after years asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball further down the field but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived about 60 of our original 724 men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s. and we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men and i am the fourth director of the study since 1938, we have tracked the lives of two groups of men the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at hazard college they all finished college during world war i and then most went off to serve in the war and the second group that we have followed was a group of boys from button's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boson of the 1930s. most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed they were given medical exams we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top and some made that journey in the opposite direction the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today 75 years later telling you that the study still continues every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives many of the inner city boson men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just is not that interesting the hazard men never ask that question to get the clearest picture of these lives we do not just send them questionnaires we interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records from their doctors we draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said it is about time so what have we learned what are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we have generated on these lives well the lessons are not about wealth or fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get from this 75 year study is this good relationships keep us happier and healthier period we have learned three big lessons about relationships the first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier they are physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five america will report that they are lonely and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that it is not just the number of friends you have and it is not whether or not you are in a committed relationship but it is the quality of your close relationships that matters it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health high conflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective once we had followed our men all all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who was not and when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it was not their middle'-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old it was how satisfied they were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men and women reported in their is that on the days when they had more physical pain their moods stayed just as happy but the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain and the third big lesson that we learn about relationships on our health is that good relationships do not just protect our bodies they protect our brains it turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your is is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those people's memories stay sharper longer and the people in relationships where they feel they really cannot count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier memory decline and those good relationships they do not have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments did not take a toll on their memories so this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well'-being, this is wisdom that is as old as the hills why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore well we are human what we would really like is a quick fix something we can get that will make our lives good and keep them that way relationships are messy and they are complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends that is not sexy or glamorous it is also lifelong it never ends the people in our 75'-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates just like the millennial in that recent survey many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life but over and over over these 75 years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let us say you are 25 or you are 40 or you are 60. what might leaning into relationships even look like well the possibilities are practically endless it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member who you have not spoken to in years because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges i would like to close with a quote from mark twain more than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this there is not time so brief is life for bickering apologies heart burnings callings to account there is only time for loving but an instant so to speak for that the good life is built with good relationships thank you\"}\n",

speak what was true and eventually learned how to live openly only in truth and the third value is courage did you know that you actually cannot have freedom or truth if you have no courage is a requirement for both you may desire to live in complete free and the complete truth but if you are lacking and courage you will live in neither one in my late is i had a tiny shred of courage not much but it was all i needed because my desire to live and be free and honest was somewhat great but that teeny shred of courage that i had was enough to allow me to walk away i have a plaque on my desk that i have had for years and it is gone with me everywhere i have ever moved it says the secret to happiness is freedom and the secrets of freedom is courage and that resonated with me i knew it was not going to be happy unless i was free but i knew i was not going to be free my second some courage to get out of there i had to cling to and act upon that tiny shred of courage in order to finally leave a cult the only friends i never know my childhood connections my history my family knowing that in doing so i finally have what i had longed for my entire life and that was freedom true freedom truth courage three words that maybe kind of trite and overused to some people to me they are the air that i breathe values upon which i insist on living and loving in my life oh and one other thing i actually know about you sharing my story talking about me i now recognize that it is in sharing my story and i can so passionately share with you my values gained over 28 years not an emotional prison that kept my heart under lock and key and kept my mind for knowing what i knew you know i sometimes wonder if perhaps living in the absence of our values is what can most clearly determine what indeed our values are and for me i really believe that the apes and the denial of created the presence of for so many years i was denied freedom truth and courage and now i will never let them go not to worry you are still not going to find me at a dinner party he is talking about my childhood not going to happen you will not find me sitting around elaborating over my father who took a wonderful church and turn it into a fifty thousand member cult i still know that is a mood killer i get it but you will find me here and in other appropriate settings especially if i can help somebody talking about my life with sincere gratitude for all that i have learned in spite of and because of living in the absence of freedom truth and courage and thank god i now have by now you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 3: {'text': 'how exciting to be here what i am going to try and do today is add to the amazing lineup of speakers today by bringing the brain into our discussion of the creative spark and i want to do that by telling you about some of the newest research that i have been doing in my neuroscience research lab at new york university asking the question can aerobic exercise that is can going to the gym actually improve your learning memory and cognition i also want to address the question of whether increased aerobic exercise can also make you more creative now i remember the day that i realized i wanted to become a neuroscientist i was a freshman at up berkeley, and i was taking a freshman seminar class with just 10 or 15 of us called the brain and its potential taught by martian diamond she was standing at the front of the classroom and she had this beautiful hat box and with her gloved hands she opened that hat box and out she pulled a real live fixed human brain now it was the very first time i would seen a human brain and what she told us was that what she was holding in her hands was the most complex structure known to mankind it is the only structure that can think about itself and one of the most amazing things about the brain is that it can change as a function of the environment it can learn it can grow and i thought that was the coolest thing i would ever heard in my whole life and i did not know it that day but that idea of the brain and its potential and what is called neural plasticity - the ability to change as a function of the environment - was going to become my life\\'s work in science that is what i want to tell you about today so i started out studying a structure in the brain called the hippocampus it is really important for long-term memory but more recently i have become interested in how exercise can actually improve our learning memory and cognition and i got interested in that not because i read a paper or went to a talk i went to the gym when i turned 40, i decided i wanted to get in the best shape of my life and i went to the gym and the class that i found that kept me coming back to the gym on a really regular basis was a class called \"intensati,\" developed by this amazing fitness instructor named patrician more in new york city now intensity is unique because it takes physical movements from kickbox, dance yoga and martial arts but the unique part is that it pairs each physical movement with a positive spoken affirmation what do i mean by that so in intensati, we do not just punch we say i am strong now and the class says it back to you so what happens is that you not only get that great aerobic exercise but because you are speaking out you actually get an increase in aerobic output and it makes you feel great so the bottom line was i got in great shape but there were two amazing benefits that i noticed one was that i had this amazing motivation i felt like a million bucks after i came out of this class and i could not wait to go back and i thought my gosh patrician more is an amazing teacher to instill that kind of motivation and then i thought well wait a second i am a teacher i wonder if my students feel that way after my neuroanatomy class i am going to come back to that in a second the second amazing benefit was that when i went back to work - when i started doing intensity i was writing a lot of grants - and i noticed that as i got more regular with the workouts my writing got easier i was able to make associations better i was able to focus better and i thought this is amazing i want to look at the neuroscience literature to understand what is going on and i looked at the literature - a lot of new studies coming out as well as looking at some of the older studies that had led to our current understanding and when i looked at those i found a very familiar name that name was martian diamond so she was not only my undergraduate advisor but she was a real pioneer in neuroscience research and really only one of the only women working in this field back in the late 1950s and \\'60s, when she discovered that when you raise rats in what she called an enriched environment with lots of toys to play with other rats to play with and they run around a lot and you compared their brains to rats raised in what she called an impoverished environment with no toys just a couple of rats in a small box what you can do is measure their brain you measure actually the thickness of that outer covering of their brain called the cortex and what she found is that the rats raised in enriched environments had cortices that were actually thicker their brain grew as a function of this enriched environment and later studies showed that exercise the increased exercise those rats were getting because they were running around a lot more was a big factor in that brain change so i thought okay this is an area that i really want to get to know and as a professor the best way to get to know topic area is to teach a class so i decided i am going to teach a class at nu called can exercise change your brain and i decided because i got inspired to do this because of exercise i thought would not it be great if i could bring exercise into the classroom and not only teach students about what exercise is doing to their brain but also teach them have them experience what exercise felt like so i thought i could do this so i decided to go to the gym and of course i loved intensati, so i became a certified intensity instructor and a certified fitness instructor i could tell you oh it was so hard i was teaching classes i was writing grants but the truth is it was so much fun it was really fun because i got to learn a whole new way to move a whole new way to motivate students and i stayed in great shape so there was nothing better so i had this class i was teaching i was going to teach an hour of aerobic exercise i trained for six months to be able to teach in front of this class - i had never done this before but i thought it would be fun - so teach an hour of aerobic exercise an hour of intensati, followed by an hour-and-a-half lecture on the effects of exercise in the brain but then i realized i had my first study right there my students could be my subjects in my first study all i had to do was test them cognitively at the beginning at the end of the semester and compare their performance to a class that did not exercise and ask whether in fact exercise could improve their cognitive performance so that is exactly what i did and before i tell you what our prediction was and what our results were i just want to take you back for a moment to september i 2009, which was the first day of this can exercise change your brain class and it is seared in my memory mainly because i was really scared and nervous i give many many lectures i love giving lectures but this one i was very nervous why because my goal was to actually try and inspire these kids to love exercise in the way that patrician more inspired me but also inspire them to love neurobiology and the brain and plasticity the way that martian diamond inspired me so i had a pretty high bar and i was pretty scared to step out in front of that classroom but i have to say i think the students were a bit scared too they would never come to a class where the instructor came in workout clothes they would never sweated in front of their professor and i got a lot of nervous laughter when i told them they were going to have to say positive affirmations not not say yell positive affirmations in class but i have to say it was the most memorable first class i have ever taught the students really got into it okay there was nervous laughter and a lot of giggling but they really got into it they were shouting the affirmations they were really going all out in the workout and the best thing was that motivation and that inspiration oozed over into our academic our lecture part they remained engaged asked lots of questions it was a fantastic first class and a fantastic semester so what did we find so our prediction goes back to that structure that i said was important for long-term memory the hippocampus it goes back to the hippocampus because the hippocampus is one of only two brain structures where new brain cells new neurons are born so you and i have shiny new hippocampus cells being born in our hippocampus but the cool thing is that experimental studies in animals have shown that increased aerobic exercise can actually enhance the birth of those new hippocampus neurons and make them live even longer so our prediction was that this increase in aerobic exercise in my nu students would actually improve their learning and memory improve their ability to learn new pieces of information and improve their ability to retain those new pieces of information did we find that well we tested them on a whole battery of different cognitive tests and what we found was one significant improvement in my class that improvement was in the ability to encode new long-term memories what task was that it was a complicated task it was actually a quite difficult task students were given a really complex geometrical image - it was like an etch-a-sketch image - and then after a delay they would have to discriminate between that etch-a-sketch image and one that looked very very similar to it my students got significantly faster at identifying the correct image that they saw before so they are able to separate out things that are coming in your memory for example you are meeting lots of new people here today and so you might be better if you exercise and come to my class at differentiating between the faces of different people that you meet today so that is a very very useful thing to be able to do so is this new what is new about this well it is new and exciting because - i have to say we are not the only people my lab is not the only lab interested in the effects of exercise but the majority of the work has been done on looking at the effects of exercise in the elderly population why because cognitive decline is a major health issue in the elderly not to even mention alzheimer\\'s disease the exciting news in the elderly population is that increased aerobic exercise has clearly been shown to improve cognition so that is great but the idea there is that there is decline already so you have a little bit of room to see improvement what about my healthy young very smart nu neuroscience majors they are at the peak of their cognitive abilities as are you and i could exercise actually help us our studies suggest that yes they can now we are not only interested in learning memory and cognition but there is a really exciting link to the topic of today\\'s conference that is creativity and that comes from one of the newest directions of study of the hippocampus we have known for a very very long time that exercise can improve - sorry - that the hippocampus is important for long-term memory but recent studies have suggested the hippocampus is also important for creativity and imagination why because patients with hippocampus damage have significant impairments at being able to imagine new situations so we ask a patient with hippocampus damage describe for me a tropical beach scene - they have never been to a tropical beach they can barely say anything about sand or water whereas a control subject would be able to tell you about the white sand and the corona in their left hand with that an umbrella in it all these different details so the idea is the hippocampus is not only important for putting new associations in mind that help you remember the events like this in your past - it will be in your past - but also important for putting new concepts together in unique ways the basis of both creativity and imagination so what we want to do - we have not done this - is to look at the effects of exercise not only on learning and memory but on increased creativity as well so what is the bottom line here the bottom line is simple increased aerobic exercise can improve learning memory and possibly creativity what is more to know and everybody wants a magic pill to get smarter well this is not a pills and it comes with a lot more sweat than a pills but it can help you it is free it helps you every day and our goal over the next ten years is trying to figure out exactly how that is helping you what exactly is changing in the brain so i only have one question for you who wants to go to the gym anybody okay great thank you'}\n",
      "Resultado 4: {'text': \"when i was 27 years old i left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding teaching i went to teach seventh'-graders math in the new york city public schools and like any teacher i i did quizzes and tests i gave out homework assignments when the work came back i calculated grades what struck me was that i was not the only difference between my best and my worst students some of my strongest performers did not have stratosphere i scores some of my smartest kids were not doing so well and that got me thinking the kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math sure they are hard ratios decimals the area of a parallelogram but these concepts are not impossible and i was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough after several more years of teaching i came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective from a psychological school perspective in education the one thing we know how to measure best is i but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily so i left the classroom and i went to graduate school to become a psychologist i started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings and in every study today my question was who is successful here and why my research team and i went to west point military academy we tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out we went to the national spelling bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition we studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the of the school years and of those who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students we partnered with private companies asking which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs and who is going to earn the most money in in all those very different contexts one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success and it was not social intelligence it was not good looks physical health and it was not i it was grit grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals grit is having stamina grit is sticking with your future day in day out not just for the week not just for the months but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality grit is living life like it is a marathon not a sprint a few years ago i started started studying grit in the chico public schools i asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduated turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduated even when i match them on every characteristic i could measure things like family income standardized achievement test scores even how safe kids felt when they were at school so it is not just at west point or the national spelling bee that grit matters it is also in school especially for kids at risk for dropping out to me the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know how little science knows about building it every day parents and teachers ask me how do i build grit in kids what do i do to teach kids a solid work ethics how do i keep them motivated for the long run the honest answer is i do not know what i do know is that talent does not make you gritty our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments in fact in our data grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent so far the best idea i have heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset this is an it is an idea developed at standard university by carol deck and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change with your effort dry deck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge they are much more likely to persevere when they fail because they do not believe that failure is a permanent condition so growth mindset i said is a great idea for building grit but we need more and that is where i am going to end my remarks because that is where we are that is the work that stands before us we need to take our best ideas our strongest intuitions and we need to test them we need to measure whether we have been successful and we have to be willing to fail to be wrong to start over again with lessons learned in other words we need to be gritty about getting kids grittier thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 5: {'text': \"maya angel once said a solitary fantasy can transform a million realities what dream or vision do you want to turn into reality i always wanted to go into business for myself i could be a consultant i am going to go gluten free right after i eat that last piece of chocolate cake laughter you know one day i am going to stand up to that crabby boss i look good on paper i should feel great i just know there is more you know it because you feel it you lie awake at night you talk about your dreams with your partner and your friends but more often than not you continue to do those same behaviors that keep you from making the change you ask yourself how can i make it happened research shows the odds against you making a change in your life i i 9 to 1. 9 to i even if you are facing a life-threatening illness but let me show you how to beat those odds you can live the life you desire it is right there in front of you but in order to achieve it you must first see it then believe it and then you must graciously ask and train your brain to help you execute your vision so how do we see our vision through a picture a picture can create movement a picture... can unite nations a picture can pull at your heart and fill you with a deep desire to do something at rochet pharmaceutical the president asked us to create a picture of his vision prior to having one less than 40 percent of the employees understood the company's vision and strategy after seeing this picture 96 percent understood it and 84 percent understood how what they did everyday align to that picture so how can you use a picture to get what you want by simply drawing one you do not have to be an artist or know how to draw as naive as your drawings might be when you draw where you are your current state and where you want to be your desired new reality suddenly you have a road map for change so what is your current state well let us say you are joey job has a good job job has a lovely wife amyl job makes good money but like many of us job wants more from life and he would like to get rid of a couple of things maybe that intense workload maybe that negative boss maybe job has a higher purpose he is just not sure how to get there so now job's current state is visual we remember things better when they are attached to a picture 65 percent better to be exact so now let us imagine that job wants to change something in his current state he wants to build that desired new reality that he dreams about in order for job to freely dream he must first... ...trick his brain because the left side of your brain as you know houses the critics who is forever trying to keep you safe from harm make sure you do not do anything dangerous or stupid so let us have job tell the critic that he is just going to use his imagination using your imagination activates the right side of your brain which makes you creative and filled with possibility so now let us dream job's new life in the best case scenario one year from today what is job's life like hey job has a new job great job has a new boss himself job has a couple of great collaborators and job is just bursting with creativity and ideas and all of those things we dream about connection and purpose and freedom and love now i am drawing this picture as the favor to job today but in real life he would have to draw his own picture because he cannot afford me laughter actually because you get the most power when you paint your own picture so now job has his drawing so now he is got to soak it in he has to fill it with color he has to fill it with emotions he has to get inside of it as if he is on the inside looking out your brain actually emits serotonin and oxytocin when you draw and dream so you feel happy capable creative you feel cool so now we have job's current state and job's desired new reality so how can job get from here to there in just three bold steps three bold steps if i knew how to get from here to there in three bold steps i would have done it 25 years ago when i had a mullet laughter here is where the magic begins your brain knows you it is cataloged everything you have ever seen heard experienced real or imagined you just have to ask it to put the pieces together for you it as simple as that we live in a three-dimensional world but the light falls on the retina in a two-dimensional fashion and the brain it has to cope with it so how does it deal with this extra dimension it guesses it guesses and just as it can guess where your cup of coffee is when it goes to pick it up it can correctly guess what the three bold steps are that you should take all you have to do is look at your picture and then close your eyes this allows the brain to recycle what it sees and reconstruct it add to it everything you have ever seen heard experienced or fantasized about and then it will serve you up with the best possible solution if you just relax and you ask it now what is the boldest thing i could do to get from here to there boom immediately it will tell you see it believe it act on it now the danger is if any of those three bold steps are too scary this instinctual rational side of your brain is going to try to talk you out of this oh not not not i do not want to do that... oh that desk it is not too small my legs are not cramped under there oh 20,000 a years oh that is a decent salary oh that boss he is not that mean to me you know what i am just going to stay right here i feel really comfortable here so how can you get yourself to do the boldest thing by drawing the most compelling picture so when you look here you are in pain it hurts when you are here you are ecstatic it is fantastic you are already living inside that connected and free life you drew so everyday you get up you soak in your picture you step into the possibility and this is the most important part you act on it you do one small thing you call up that friend you know who started her own business you ask her how did you do it you ask amyl will you support me in my vision you go to your boss and you ask him for a raise and you become that one person out of ten to make change happen now i put this template on your chairs so that you can do for yourself what i just did for joey you have seen some fantastic ideas today that have inspired your dream i dare you to draw that dream into that template i double dare you to choose a symbol in your drawing that represents that desired new reality take a picture of it with your phone and send it to us at tedxrainier. maya angel said a solitary fantasy can transform a million realities just three bold steps can transform one reality yours thank you\"}\n"

i had never done this before but i thought it would be fun - so teach an hour of aerobic exercise an hour of intensati, followed by an hour-and-a-half lecture on the effects of exercise in the brain but then i realized i had my first study right there my students could be my subjects in my first study all i had to do was test them cognitively at the beginning at the end of the semester and compare their performance to a class that did not exercise and ask whether in fact exercise could improve their cognitive performance so that is exactly what i did and before i tell you what our prediction was and what our results were i just want to take you back for a moment to september i 2009, which was the first day of this can exercise change your brain class and it is seared in my memory mainly because i was really scared and nervous i give many many lectures i love giving lectures but this one i was very nervous why because my goal was to actually try and inspire these kids to love exercise in the way that patrician more inspired me but also inspire them to love neurobiology and the brain and plasticity the way that martian diamond inspired me so i had a pretty high bar and i was pretty scared to step out in front of that classroom but i have to say i think the students were a bit scared too they would never come to a class where the instructor came in workout clothes they would never sweated in front of their professor and i got a lot of nervous laughter when i told them they were going to have to say positive affirmations not not say yell positive affirmations in class but i have to say it was the most memorable first class i have ever taught the students really got into it okay there was nervous laughter and a lot of giggling but they really got into it they were shouting the affirmations they were really going all out in the workout and the best thing was that motivation and that inspiration oozed over into our academic our lecture part they remained engaged asked lots of questions it was a fantastic first class and a fantastic semester so what did we find so our prediction goes back to that structure that i said was important for long-term memory the hippocampus it goes back to the hippocampus because the hippocampus is one of only two brain structures where new brain cells new neurons are born so you and i have shiny new hippocampus cells being born in our hippocampus but the cool thing is that experimental studies in animals have shown that increased aerobic exercise can actually enhance the birth of those new hippocampus neurons and make them live even longer so our prediction was that this increase in aerobic exercise in my nu students would actually improve their learning and memory improve their ability to learn new pieces of information and improve their ability to retain those new pieces of information did we find that well we tested them on a whole battery of different cognitive tests and what we found was one significant improvement in my class that improvement was in the ability to encode new long-term memories what task was that it was a complicated task it was actually a quite difficult task students were given a really complex geometrical image - it was like an etch-a-sketch image - and then after a delay they would have to discriminate between that etch-a-sketch image and one that looked very very similar to it my students got significantly faster at identifying the correct image that they saw before so they are able to separate out things that are coming in your memory for example you are meeting lots of new people here today and so you might be better if you exercise and come to my class at differentiating between the faces of different people that you meet today so that is a very very useful thing to be able to do so is this new what is new about this well it is new and exciting because - i have to say we are not the only people my lab is not the only lab interested in the effects of exercise but the majority of the work has been done on looking at the effects of exercise in the elderly population why because cognitive decline is a major health issue in the elderly not to even mention alzheimer\\'s disease the exciting news in the elderly population is that increased aerobic exercise has clearly been shown to improve cognition so that is great but the idea there is that there is decline already so you have a little bit of room to see improvement what about my healthy young very smart nu neuroscience majors they are at the peak of their cognitive abilities as are you and i could exercise actually help us our studies suggest that yes they can now we are not only interested in learning memory and cognition but there is a really exciting link to the topic of today\\'s conference that is creativity and that comes from one of the newest directions of study of the hippocampus we have known for a very very long time that exercise can improve - sorry - that the hippocampus is important for long-term memory but recent studies have suggested the hippocampus is also important for creativity and imagination why because patients with hippocampus damage have significant impairments at being able to imagine new situations so we ask a patient with hippocampus damage describe for me a tropical beach scene - they have never been to a tropical beach they can barely say anything about sand or water whereas a control subject would be able to tell you about the white sand and the corona in their left hand with that an umbrella in it all these different details so the idea is the hippocampus is not only important for putting new associations in mind that help you remember the events like this in your past - it will be in your past - but also important for putting new concepts together in unique ways the basis of both creativity and imagination so what we want to do - we have not done this - is to look at the effects of exercise not only on learning and memory but on increased creativity as well so what is the bottom line here the bottom line is simple increased aerobic exercise can improve learning memory and possibly creativity what is more to know and everybody wants a magic pill to get smarter well this is not a pills and it comes with a lot more sweat than a pills but it can help you it is free it helps you every day and our goal over the next ten years is trying to figure out exactly how that is helping you what exactly is changing in the brain so i only have one question for you who wants to go to the gym anybody okay great thank you'}\n",
      "Resultado 2: {'text': \"what keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life if you were going to invest now in your future best self where would you put your time and your energy there was a recent survey of millennial asking them what their most important life goals were and over 80 % said that a major life goal for them was to get rich and another 50 % of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous and we are constantly told to lean in to work to push harder and achieve more we are given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them those pictures are almost impossible to get most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but 2020. we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative but what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study many people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy we did that the hazard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that is ever been done for 75 years we have tracked the lives of 724 men year after years asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball further down the field but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived about 60 of our original 724 men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s. and we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men and i am the fourth director of the study since 1938, we have tracked the lives of two groups of men the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at hazard college they all finished college during world war i and then most went off to serve in the war and the second group that we have followed was a group of boys from button's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boson of the 1930s. most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed they were given medical exams we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top and some made that journey in the opposite direction the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today 75 years later telling you that the study still continues every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives many of the inner city boson men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just is not that interesting the hazard men never ask that question to get the clearest picture of these lives we do not just send them questionnaires we interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records from their doctors we draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said it is about time so what have we learned what are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we have generated on these lives well the lessons are not about wealth or fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get from this 75 year study is this good relationships keep us happier and healthier period we have learned three big lessons about relationships the first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier they are physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five america will report that they are lonely and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that it is not just the number of friends you have and it is not whether or not you are in a committed relationship but it is the quality of your close relationships that matters it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health high conflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective once we had followed our men all all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who was not and when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it was not their middle'-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old it was how satisfied they were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men and women reported in their is that on the days when they had more physical pain their moods stayed just as happy but the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain and the third big lesson that we learn about relationships on our health is that good relationships do not just protect our bodies they protect our brains it turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your is is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those people's memories stay sharper longer and the people in relationships where they feel they really cannot count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier memory decline and those good relationships they do not have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments did not take a toll on their memories so this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well'-being, this is wisdom that is as old as the hills why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore well we are human what we would really like is a quick fix something we can get that will make our lives good and keep them that way relationships are messy and they are complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends that is not sexy or glamorous it is also lifelong it never ends the people in our 75'-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates just like the millennial in that recent survey many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life but over and over over these 75 years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let us say you are 25 or you are 40 or you are 60. what might leaning into relationships even look like well the possibilities are practically endless it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member who you have not spoken to in years because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges i would like to close with a quote from mark twain more than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this there is not time so brief is life for bickering apologies heart burnings callings to account there is only time for loving but an instant so to speak for that the good life is built with good relationships thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 3: {'text': \"all right hello so i have had a lifelong fascination with how we organize how we humans work together to express some work or some purpose in the world and i would like to start by sharing a story bit about my journey it is a story that is true and it is become a bit of a metaphor for my own my own path i have a private a harrowing experience pilot's license and when i was first learning to fly i had a rather harrowing experience i am up in the plane i am still a student pilot i have 20-some hours of flight time i yes they let you fly a plane alone with 20-some hours of practice so i am up in this plane it is my first cross-country solo flight so the first time i am flying hundreds of miles away from home with no instructor with me and i am all ready for the journey i go up i start flying little nervous and the low voltage light comes on they do not teach you much about how the plane works right barely not apply the thing so you know what do i do well my first instinct is to you know tap the low voltage light but that does not change anything my next instinct is to check my other instruments to see if there is a big problem here right so one by one i check all of my other instruments the altimeter says you are not losing altitude there is nothing wrong all right the navigation aid says you are perfectly on course congratulations everything's fine the airspeed indicator says you are not losing speed you are flying fast everything's great so i let those other instruments outvote the low voltage light yeah i figured nothing else is reporting anything anomalous it must not be that big of a problem right that was a really bad idea turns out who would have thought that low voltage light is actually tuned in to different information than every other instrument on that control panel oops i nearly crashed the plane that day and fortunately i did make it down there were some steps in the middle there i will skip for you but i made it down and after the adrenaline wears off it occurs to me we do this in our organizations all the time when we humans show up in organizations we become the sensors the instruments for that organizations flight towards its purpose we sense reality on its behalf it is through us that it becomes aware of whatever it needs to deal with or do in the world and we humans are different and we sense different things we have different talents backgrounds different types different talents we sense different things and it is sometimes something sensed by only one person or by the many minority that is critical to integrate into how we proceed and we often ignore them and this really echoed my experience back when i worked in more conventional organizations that was my experience i showed up in a company i wanted to be a sensor for this company i wanted to be an instrument i sensed reality and i wanted to do something with it and i am sure all of you have had the experience of going into some organization somewhere and sensing something important maybe it is a hole in a process or a way to improve something that is not working as well as it could be something slipping through the cracks and i would often have those experiences but have nothing i could do to act on them right there would be no way to integrate that into the organization in fact i no way to integrate learned early on that if the boss did not sense it i was not gonna get it processed have you ever seen that you know you sense something important but the boss just does not see it good luck that shuts down the organization's capacity to integrate and harness whatever it was that i tuned in to find the low-voltage light were in trouble so my quest since then has been how can we humans show up as sensors for our organizations and i did the only logical thing i was i became a boss this is more personal now how can i show up and to be a sensor for organization the only logical thing once i realized that anything i sensed that the boss did not was not gonna get address well i became a boss right that is nice and simple now i get to really run things the way i think they should be you know and unfortunately i realized there was still another boss you know so after climbing the corporate ladder a bit i got fed up with that and realized all right the only way i am really going to be able to process anything my sense is if i drop out of this whole game and start my own company where i get to be the coo at the top and now there is no boss getting in the way of processing whatever it is i am sensing so i did that i started a software company and built it over many years and you know at first that worked great i could get a lot of the stuff i sensed processed but then something unfortunate happened i realized well i am not even able to even as the coo as this company's growing i am not even able to take everything that i see and get it processed the systems are not responsive enough right the way we have structured and built our organizations today does not let me even as the coo get everything i sense integrated and harnessed and processed and that was not actually the worst of it the far more painful realization was i had just built the very system that i had struggled so long and tried to move past right now everyone else in that company did not get whatever it was that they could tune into and sense harnessed and integrated unless i saw it and no matter how much i might work on myself focus on my own development try to be the most empowering servant leader i can be the reality is i am still a human i still have bad days i still miss things right and i had built the very system that i had tried to escape so my question then shifted a bit it became how do i build something different and how do i build a system where that is not the case where anything since by anyone can integrate and change the organization to help it better express whatever work it is doing in the world so one of the things we attention realized is there is incredible energy there in the things we sense when we tune in to a gap between where we are and what could be right we call this attention because we often sense it as tension right that it is not just intellectual it is that feeling in your gut the frustration that comes when you see a process that you know could be better or you are banging your head into the same damn problem multiple times you feel tense you feel this tension about it could also be an opportunity if something exciting but it is this gap between where we are and where you sense we could be and just like a rubber band stretched between two points there is such energy there although we often tension experience it as a negative i do not mean it that way at all and if we can do something with it becomes energy not frustration right the root of the word tension in satin tense era means to stretch it is a stretch so how can we power an organization fuel its continual evolution its continual updating how it works and how we work together based on these tensions that we sense so interesting question hard thing to do and we tried a lot of things so we experimented over years we tried running an organization via consensus seemed like a good idea at the time it was a complete disaster if you ever want to sit in long painful meetings all the time and never get anything done try running your organization with consensus what i realized was there is a consensus big difference between having a voice and actually being able to do something with your voice being able to actually process everything you sense into some kind of meaningful change consensus did not do it in fact often that would result in long painful meetings where we all tried to get everyone to see it the same way i do not want my low voltage light to have to see things the same way as my fuel gauge i do not need that and it is not a healthy system in fact i want to let each of them sense what they can sense best and all integrate into the flight plan so how can we have an organization where any tension sense by anyone anywhere in the company has someplace to go to get rapidly and reliably processed into meaningful change that was the question consensus did not work so we tried other things and we started finding approaches we started coming up with something and one of the first things we realized on that journey is we actually need to harness autocratic harness autocratic authority the very thing we moved away from in the beginning right autocratic authority because if we are sensing on behalf of the organization and we want to be dynamic and fast and responsive which we have to be to process everything everyone senses most of the things we sense we need to act on locally we need to be not just sensors but actors in this system and to do that we need the authority to act without having to go to a painful meeting and try to get everybody bought into every decision you want to make in cells in the human body other words we need to be a lot more like cells in the human body each one needs a clear boundary within which it has autonomy that has authority but what you do not see is a coo cell right a manager cell directing the others what to do each cell has its own autonomy but it is distributed that is the direction we moved in a system where everybody has autocratic authority but they know the bounds of their authority they know the interconnections they know when they have to get somebody ease's input or when they have to integrate with someone they know the bounds of their authority and the connections they know what they the process can expect of each other and in most organizations we have managers to fill the central point to do that to align all of us and to distribute authority but we have already covered the limits of that so how can we do that without managers in the way well for that we need a process if we do not have managers to align and integrate we need a process which aligns and integrates a process which lets each of us be a sovereign autonomous agent on behalf of this organization and its purpose and integrate in other words we need something that is a lot less like a feudal hierarchy and a lot more like a constitutional entity and that is exactly what we have so in my organization i work in every day i get to experience this it is quite liberating in my organization now we have no coo we have no managers every individual partner in that firm has real authority that no one else can trump but it is distributed we each have different authority and we know the bounds and the limits of each and we have a constitution that defines how we integrate together a constitution that defines a governance process which is not governed of the people by the people for the people but rather is governance of the organization through the people as sensors for the purpose whatever it is we are here to do together when we have that kind of tangible system real processes that hold and distribute real authority and integrate us and figure out how do we need to interconnect and align expectations when that process allows everyone to have a voice for the sake of the purpose and when you have a process to integrate anything you sense conclusion anything you sense whatsoever any constraint on expressing this this purpose in the world and you can integrate it and change and reshape the organization dynamically in real time reshape how we work together what authority everyone has you have got a system that is dramatically more responsive and adaptable without the waste of managers in the way limiting what tensions you can process all of this we have captured in what we call a new social technology for organizations it is a new operating system it is tangible that constitutions available on our website and you can find it you can find organizations running with it all over the world now it is spreading is called holacracy you can find more at our website holacracy or and learn a bit more about how this system aligns us to each to the purpose each of us to the purpose while giving us the freedom and autonomy and yet an integrated whole thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 4: {'text': 'so i will start with this a couple years ago an event planner called me because i was going to do a speaking event and she called and she said i am really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyers and i thought well what is the struggle and she said well i saw you speak and i am going to call you a researchers i think but i am afraid if i call you a researchers no one will come because they will think you are boring and irrelevant laughter and i was like \"okay.\" and she said but the thing i liked about your talk is you are a storyteller so i think what i will do is just call you a storyteller and of course the academic insecure part of me was like you are going to call me a what and she said i am going to call you a storyteller and i was like why not magic pixie\\'s laughter i was like let me think about this for a second i tried to call deep on my courage and i thought you know i am a storyteller i am a qualitative researchers i collect stories that is what i do and maybe stories are just data with a soul and maybe i am just a storyteller and so i said you know what why do not you just say i am a researcher-storyteller.\" and she went ha had there is no such thing laughter so i am a researcher-storyteller, and i am going to talk to you today we are talking about expanding perception and so i want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that i live and love and work and parents and this is where my story starts when i was a young researchers doctoral student my first years i had a research professor who said to us there is the thing if you cannot measure it it does not exist and i thought he was just sweet-talking me i was like \"really?\" and he was like \"absolutely.\" and so you have to understand that i have a bachelor\\'s and a master\\'s in social work and i was getting my ph.d. in social work so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the life\\'s messy love it and i am more of the life\\'s messy clean it up organize it and put it into a bent box laughter and so to think that i had found my way to found a career that takes me really one of the big sayings in social work is clean into the discomfort of the work and i am like knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all as that was my mantra so i was very excited about this and so i thought you know what this is the career for me because i am interested in some messy topics but i want to be able to make them not messy i want to understand them i want to hack into these things that i know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see so where i started was with connection because by the time you are a social worker for 10 years what you realize is that connection is why we are here it is what gives purpose and meaning to our lives this is what it is all about it does not matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice mental health and abuse and neglect what we know is that connection the ability to feel connected is neurobiologically that is how we are wired it is why we are here so i thought you know what i am going to start with connection well you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss and she tells you 37 things that you do really awesome and one opportunity for growth laughter and all you can think about is that opportunity for growth right well apparently this is the way my work went as well because when you ask people about love they tell you about heartbreak when you ask people about belonging they will tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded and when you ask people about connection the stories they told me were about disconnection so very quickly really about six weeks into this research i ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that i did not understand or had never seen and so i pulled back out of the research and thought i need to figure out what this is and it turned out to be shame and shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection is there something about me that if other people know it or see it that i will not be worthy of connection the things i can tell you about it it is universal we all have it the only people who do not experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection no one wants to talk about it and the less you talk about it the more you have it what underpinned this shame this i am not good enough which we all know that feeling i am not blank enough i am not thin enough rich enough beautiful enough smart enough promoted enough the thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability this idea of in order for connection to happen we have to allow ourselves to be seen really seen and you know how i feel about vulnerability i hate vulnerability and so i thought this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick i am going in i am going to figure this stuff out i am going to spend a years i am going to totally deconstruct shame i am going to understand how vulnerability works and i am going to outsmart it so i was ready and i was really excited as you know it is not going to turn out well laughter you know this so i could tell you a lot about shame but i would have to borrow everyone ease\\'s time but here\\'s what i can tell you that it boils down to and this may be one of the most important things that i have ever learned in the decade of doing this research my one year turned into six years thousands of stories hundreds of long interviews focus groups at one point people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories thousands of pieces of data in six years and i kind of got a handle on it i kind of understood this is what shame is this is how it works i wrote a book i published a theory but something was not okay and what it was is that if i roughly took the people i interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness that is what this comes down to a sense of worthiness they have a strong sense of love and belonging and folks who struggle for it and folks who are always wondering if they are good enough there was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it and that was the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they are worthy of love and belonging that is it they believe they are worthy and to me the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we are not worthy of connection was something that personally and professionally i felt like i needed to understand better so what i did is i took all of the interviews where i saw worthiness where i saw people living that way and just looked at those what do these people have in common i have a slight office supply addiction but that is another talk so i had a manila folder and i had a sharpie and i was like what am i going to call this research and the first words that came to my mind were \"whole-hearted.\" these are wholehearted people living from this deep sense of worthiness so i wrote at the top of the manila folder and i started looking at the data in fact i did it first in a four-day, very intensive data analysis where i went back pulled the interviews the stories pulled the incidents what is the theme what is the pattern my husband left town with the kids because i always go into this jacks pollock crazy thing where i am just writing and in my researcher model and so here\\'s what i found what they had in common was a sense of courage and i want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minutes courage the original definition of courage when it first came into the english language it is from the satin word \"cor,\" meaning heart and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart and so these folks had very simply the courage to be imperfect they had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others because as it turns out we cannot practice compassion with other people if we cannot treat ourselves kindly and the last was they had connection and this was the hard part as a result of authenticity they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were which you have to absolutely do that for connection the other thing that they had in common was this they fully embraced vulnerability they believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful they did not talk about vulnerability being comfortable nor did they really talk about it being excruciating as i had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing they just talked about it being necessary they talked about the willingness to say i love you first ... the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ... the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram they are willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out they thought this was fundamental i personally thought it was betrayal i could not believe i had pledged allegiance to research where our job you know the definition of research is to control and predict to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict and now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting this led to a little breakdown laughter which actually looked more like this laughter and it did i call it a breakdown my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening laughter a spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown but i assure you it was a breakdown and i had to put my data away and go find a therapist let me tell you something you know who you are when you call your friends and say i think i need to see somebody do you have any recommendations because about five of my friends were like \"wooo, i would not want to be your therapist laughter i was like what does that mean and they are like i am just saying you know do not bring your measuring stick laughter i was like \"okay.\" so i found a therapist my first meeting with her liana i brought in my list of the way the wholehearted live and i sat down and she said how are you and i said i am great i am okay she said what is going on and this is a therapist who sees therapists because we have to go to those because their best meters are good laughter and so i said there is the thing i am struggling and she said what is the struggle and i said well i have a vulnerability issue and i know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness but it appears that it is also the birthplace of joy of creativity of belonging of love and i think i have a problem and i need some help and i said but here\\'s the thing no family stuff no childhood shit laughter i just need some strategies laughter applause thank you so she goes like this laughter and then i said it is bad right and she said it is neither good nor bad laughter it just is what it is and i said oh my god this is going to suck laughter and it did and it did not and it took about a years and you know how there are people that when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important that they surrender and walk into it a that is not me and be i do not even hang out with people like that laughter for me it was a yearlong street fight it was a slugfest. vulnerability pushed i pushed back i lost the fight but probably won my life back and so then i went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they the wholehearted what choices they were making and what we are doing with vulnerability why do we struggle with it so much am i alone in struggling with vulnerability not so this is what i learned we numb vulnerability when we are waiting for the call it was funny i sent something out on twitter and on casebook that says how would you define vulnerability what makes you feel vulnerable and within an hour and a half i had 150 responses because i wanted to know what is out there having to ask my husband for help because i am sick and we are newly married initiating sex with my husband initiating sex with my wife being turned down asking someone out waiting for the doctor to call back getting laid off laying off people this is the world we live in we live in a vulnerable world and one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability and i think there is evidence and it is not the only reason this evidence exists but i think it is a huge cause we are the most indent ... obese ... addicted and medicated adult cohort in us history the problem is and i learned this from the research that you cannot selectively numb emotions you cannot say here\\'s the bad stuff here\\'s vulnerability here\\'s grief here\\'s shame here\\'s fear here\\'s disappointment i do not want to feel these i am going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin laughter i do not want to feel these and i know that is knowing laughter i hack into your lives for a living god laughter you cannot numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects our emotions you cannot selectively numb so when we numb those we numb joy we numb gratitude we numb happiness and then we are miserable and we are looking for purpose and meaning and then we feel vulnerable so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin and it becomes this dangerous cycle one of the things that i think we need to think about is why and how we numb and it does not just have to be addiction the other thing we do is we make everything that is uncertain certain religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty i am right you are wrong shut up that is it just certain the more afraid we are the more vulnerable we are the more afraid we are this is what politics looks like today there is no discourse anymore there is no conversation there is just blame you know how blame is described in the research a way to discharge pain and discomfort we perfect if there is anyone who wants their life to look like this it would be me but it does not work because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks laughter which just i hope in 100 years people will look back and got \"wow.\" laughter and we perfect most dangerously our children let me tell you what we think about children they are hardwired for struggle when they get here and when you hold those perfect little babies in your hands our job is not to say look at her she is perfect my job is just to keep her perfect make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and male by seventh that is not our job our job is to look and say you know what you are imperfect and you are wired for struggle but you are worthy of love and belonging that is our job show me a generation of kids raised like that and we will end the problems i think that we see today we pretend that what we do does not have an effect on people we do that in our personal lives we do that corporate whether it is a bailout an oil spill ... a recall we pretend like what we are doing does not have a huge impact on other people i would say to companies this is not our first rodeo people we just need you to be authentic and real and say ... we are sorry we will fix it but there is another way and i will leave you with this this is what i have found to let ourselves be seen deeply seen vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts even though there is no guarantee and that is really hard and i can tell you as a parents that is excruciatingly difficult to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror when we are wondering can i love you this much can i believe in this this passionately can i be this fierce about this just to be able to stop and instead of catastrophizing what might happen to say i am just so grateful because to feel this vulnerable means i am alive and the last which i think is probably the most important is to believe that we are enough because when we work from a place i believe that says i am enough ... then we stop screaming and start listening we are kinder and gentler to the people around us and we are kinder and gentler to ourselves that is all i have thank you'}\n",
      "Resultado 5: {'text': \"when i was 27 years old i left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding teaching i went to teach seventh'-graders math in the new york city public schools and like any teacher i i did quizzes and tests i gave out homework assignments when the work came back i calculated grades what struck me was that i was not the only difference between my best and my worst students some of my strongest performers did not have stratosphere i scores some of my smartest kids were not doing so well and that got me thinking the kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math sure they are hard ratios decimals the area of a parallelogram but these concepts are not impossible and i was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough after several more years of teaching i came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective from a psychological school perspective in education the one thing we know how to measure best is i but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily so i left the classroom and i went to graduate school to become a psychologist i started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings and in every study today my question was who is successful here and why my research team and i went to west point military academy we tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out we went to the national spelling bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition we studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the of the school years and of those who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students we partnered with private companies asking which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs and who is going to earn the most money in in all those very different contexts one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success and it was not social intelligence it was not good looks physical health and it was not i it was grit grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals grit is having stamina grit is sticking with your future day in day out not just for the week not just for the months but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality grit is living life like it is a marathon not a sprint a few years ago i started started studying grit in the chico public schools i asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduated turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduated even when i match them on every characteristic i could measure things like family income standardized achievement test scores even how safe kids felt when they were at school so it is not just at west point or the national spelling bee that grit matters it is also in school especially for kids at risk for dropping out to me the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know how little science knows about building it every day parents and teachers ask me how do i build grit in kids what do i do to teach kids a solid work ethics how do i keep them motivated for the long run the honest answer is i do not know what i do know is that talent does not make you gritty our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments in fact in our data grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent so far the best idea i have heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset this is an it is an idea developed at standard university by carol deck and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change with your effort dry deck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge they are much more likely to persevere when they fail because they do not believe that failure is a permanent condition so growth mindset i said is a great idea for building grit but we need more and that is where i am going to end my remarks because that is where we are that is the work that stands before us we need to take our best ideas our strongest intuitions and we need to test them we need to measure whether we have been successful and we have to be willing to fail to be wrong to start over again with lessons learned in other words we need to be gritty about getting kids grittier thank you\"}\n"

      "Resultado 1: {'text': 'so why is it the case that when we are feeling the most anxious uncomfortable socially awkward versions of ourselves when our hearts are pounding and our palms are sweating and we feel like crawling out of our skin are we also the most nice and often generic to the people around us i am a social psychologist and i have been studying the science of uncomfortable social interactions for over years so everything from new roommate relationships negotiations upward feedback with your boss to doctor patient-interactions, those moments where you need to break in and say yeah for the last minutes i actually have no idea what you were talking about can we maybe rewind a bit and to study these things i look at three main outcomes first i look at what people say the things we can control how friendly we are how much we complement one another how much we give gracious feedback second i look at the things that are tougher for us to control our nonverbal behaviors things like fidgeting avoiding eye contact playing with our hair doodling even even our tone of voice and then i look at the things that are impossible for us to control our under-the-skin responses our physiology our cardiovascular reactivity things like blood pressure heart rate these types of things that we often do not even really realize that we are feeling and the way i do this is by having people come into the lab and interact with each other in a bunch of different settings and i have them negotiate with each other i have them get acquainted with each other and often it is the case that in these interactions people are required to give some form of feedback to their partner tell them honestly what they are thinking or feeling come in with an offer for a negotiations tell them what they could have done better next time and i think we all kind of know what it feels like to be in one of these studies you might not know what it would really feel like to be in one of my studies there is a lot of equipment involved but we plug people up to all of these things to measure these under-the-skin responses we videotape them to capture those behaviors that i just mentioned now to get us all into this mindset of what it is like to feel awkward but maybe potentially a little bit nice i want you all to think about what was the last awkward interaction that you had oka so keep this thought in your mind you can think about it for a few moments because in a couple minutes i am actually going to randomly call on someone based on your seat to have you come up and share your story of what that moment felt like so before we do that i just want you all to kind of get a sense of the typical pattern that we see when people are engaging in these interactions so we bring them into the lab we hook them up to all this equipment and within moments within the first seconds we start to see those stress responses that i mentioned their heart rate goes up their blood pressure increases it does not take much to get people to start to feel anxious next we see it in those nonverbal behaviors they start to fidget they avoid eye contact they pull their chair a couple inches away from the person who is sitting next to them in an effort just to get a little bit more distance one of my favorite findings is in doctor-patient interactions uncomfortable doctors they look down at the chart more or they look more at the computer screen instead of making eye contact with those patients so let us all return to your awkward moment does everyone have an awkward moment in mind or thinking about one how many of you have increases in your heart rate maybe your palms are sweating you can start to feel yourself getting a little tingly just with the mere thought of being called upon today hey a few of you how many people would actually be excited about that opportunity not i oka same people laughter how many of you if i did call on you would walk up here you would grin through gritted teeth like this and you would do it even though you secretly hated me the whole time a few of you do not worry i am not going to actually do this this was all just a ruse to teach you a lesson which is in uncomfortable social interactions we often do not have a social script of what to do instead of telling people what we really think what we really feel we do the nice thing that makes us incredibly uncomfortable now one of my favorite findings illustrating this effect is in the context of negotiations i went to a major firm and i brought people together who were used to working with one another and we had them engage in a negotiations and at the end of it there was a winner and there was a loser so we said to the winner you know this is really a study about feedback and what we would like you to do is give some constructive feedback to the person who just lost what are some things that they could do better next time what are some potential missteps how many of you think that that is what they actually did they really followed our instructions oka nobody you can see where this is going what we found is that even when we are talking to someone who just lost a negotiation to us we tend to bend over backwards we say things like the way you made that really early offer and did not even ask for a counter that was amazing or it was so great how you did not even ask me anything about my side or what i was willing to kind of you know change on or be flexible on people layered on the compliments to someone who they just beat in a negotiations telling them how great they are so often these kinds of interactions that take the form of what ill call anxious niceness they involve a lot of compliments telling people what they do well in a very general nonspecific way but a lot of my work actually looks at what is it like to be on the receiving end of these types of interactions how do you feel when you interact with someone over and over again who is giving off these kinds of brittle smiles these are typically the kinds of facial expressions that we actually see from people kind of sneering a little bit of side eyes you know arms crossed these types of things after a lifetime of interacting with someone who engages in anxious niceness what we find is that most people on the receiving end are racial minorities they are disadvantaged group members they are the type of people that we are worried about appearing prejudiced in front of and that anxiety is regulated by being over-the-top nice to these folks we also find that these individuals tend to be more synchronized to and attentive to the how-we-say-it piece than the what-we-say part so in one study we had black and white america interact with each other in a cross-race interaction and we brought them into the lab and we measured the physiology of both partners what this allowed us to do is capture the degree to which people stress those under-the-skin responses can actually be caught by their partners and what we expected to find is that the black participants would become more synchronized physiologically to those whites they would be more attuned to those kind of nonverbal signals of anxiety and that is exactly what we found the more anxious those white participants appeared the more they fidgeted the more they avoided eye contact even the higher their cortisol reactivity indicating some real deep kind of under-the-skin stress response the more those black participants became linked up to them over time and i think this finding is a little bit terrifying i think it means that we often think of our own stress and our own physiology as independent of the people we interact with but our bodies are not always our own our physiology is not always our own and if you spend a lifetime interacting with people who are so nice to you in an effort to control their anxiety you could potentially catch that stress it could negatively affect your bodies now often what we find is the type of feedback that people are actually getting is not always super direct sometimes it is a little bit patronizing so you could probably see where i am going with this having over-the-top positive nice feedback can harm your performance it can make it very difficult for you to climb up difficult to kind of know where you stand what you should do better what you should stop doing but can also damage people in ways that we often do not think about it can affect their reputations outside of the interaction context so imagine the case that you are one of these people who loves giving this general nice feedback and you have someone who works for you and a recruiter calls maybe a past employee a recruiter calls you or someone asks you for a letter of recommendation the kinds of things you are going to put are going to be like they are are real team player they have great energy at work generic things yes they are nice but they are not very telling about what that person is really like and what we find is that the readers of these things at best think to themselves wow they must not really know this person at all i do not even know what this means at worst they think to themselves well they probably have some real opinions they are just afraid to share them so these kinds of general positive feedback tend to actually harm people\\'s reputation when they are not backed up with real data so i think we have to then think about what is the solution to this problem is it the case that we should all just be meaner to each other in an effort to be more direct i do not think that is the case at all i think there are some things we can do and i am going to highlight three of them to improve the degree to which we give clear consistent feedback to people particularly in the workplace so first we need to ask ourselves the question how many people are on board with this niceness culture really there is a bit of a plural ignorance that goes on when we think about how nice we are to people at work what i have found is that for every one person who loves this kind of general generic nice feedback there is another person who feels like it is lazy who feels like it is not helpful and i actually learned this lesson the hard way from one of my students recently she was giving a practice talk in my lab and she spent weeks and weeks preparing it probably harder than anyone else i would ever seen on preparing a talk like this and then she went and gave it and she came back and i said how did the talk got did it go well she said it was terrible it was horrible it was the worst experience i said well what happened and she said all i got were a bunch of great jobs that was interesting and then some clap emesis from the people on zoom not a single person asked a tough question she said and i had this moment where i realized that positive feedback can come across as lazy feedback it can come across as disengaged feedback and so if we want to change this culture we actually need to first do a quick pulse of how many people are actually more interested in doing the tougher constructive forms of this type of feedback so you might be thinking to yourselves alright i might be on board with this idea of tough yet honest feedback so what should i do should i go to people and say alright do you want me to be ... nice or honest and useful?\\'\" not do not do this you will by and large get a lot of people telling you you know i actually just want to keep it nice that just feels a lot more comfortable for me what i learned in my work is that this process i have been talking about about giving anxious nice feedback is just as much about the feedback receiver as it is about the feedback giver people get into a bit of a dance with each other i give you nice feedback you kind of know it is is but you smile and say thank you and then you know go on your way it takes a lot to break that interpersonal cycle and to do that we have to think about how we actually want to frame our feedback to other people so instead of asking people should i be nice or honest and useful what i like to do is ask people can i give you feedback on a couple dimensions can we think about feedback as general versus specific another dimension would be can we think about things that you are doing well you should keep doing versus things that please stop and i will get in a moment to how we can actually frame that form of negative feedback so i think a lot of us are actually pretty decent at the positive general feedback right i love how timely you are but what does that mean it could mean that you are on time for meetings it could mean that you turn your work in on time it could mean it in a very global way of you sure managed to do a lot in five years or it could mean something so specific like it is so helpful that you send in your reports by pm,√Ç\\x94 but i do not really want to comment on all those other kinds of forms of being timely and when we do the kind of general feedback that is negative the please stop we need it to be specific so kind of one of the more common forms of general negative feedback people get is you do not take enough initiative here how many of you have ever been told please take some more initiative i think most of us at some point in our lives have experienced this what does that mean does it mean i should speak up more in meetings does it mean i should be quicker on my email does it mean i should do your job without complaining about doing your job which is often what it actually means we have to break it down into the specifics and that could include things like do not wait for tom to ask if you found any errors before you say tomb i found some errors.\\'\" now an important piece here is what people should do instead often if we get to the stage where we are comfortable enough telling people i have a specific critical negative thing i want to tell you i please stop interrupting people you know not telling tom about the errors showing up five minutes late with coffee so i know what you were doing during those five minutes i we do not tend to replace them with anything but we know from our personal lives that replacing negative critical please stop behaviors is absolutely essential so i want to take you out of the workplace for a moment and we are going to go to the bedroom yes i said we are going to the bedroom so imagine it is the case that you just had sex with someone for the first time oka we are all there we have done a lot of tantalizing today and you turn to the person and you say those last three things you just did back there no good they are all bad did not like any of them they are going to look at you in shock and surprise and say well what should i do instead right and until we are ready to actually fire the person or kick them out of bed or fire them from our team we have to focus on those replacement behaviors what they should be doing instead and i think as we think through kind of scaling this type of feedback it can be very scary to make these types of change what i found is that cultures of anxious nice feedback are ingrained they are systemic they are deeply embedded in a community in the workplace in a team even in dyadic interpersonal relationships and so to break that cycle you have to start small you need to start neutral and by neutral i mean things that are not scary to hear critical feedback on you might be thinking to yourself what is some neutral feedback that you could give me at the end of my talk how about i would switch the order of the points on your talk or i would change the font these types of feedback are specific and so they are useful but they are not scary to deliver and they are not actually scary to received and what we find is that when people take these baby steps to work up to this type of feedback they are much less anxious in the delivery so those behaviors i opened with of people fidgeting engaging in what we call a brittle smile avoiding eye contact they actually go down and so do those stress responses when you know and you are anticipating giving this kind of feedback that is not going to sting and i think as you work through this i do not want to be a proponent of killing niceness entirely i think it is actually really important to put niceness in the delivery of your feedback and that can come across in a bunch of different ways it can come across as by showing you are engaged you listened you know what the person\\'s actually trying to do you are aligned with their goals the first time i actually got this type of critical nice feedback was after a talk i gave and the person came up to me and she said can i give you some feedback and immediately my heart started pounding i am like oh great here we got no one likes hearing can i give you some feedback and she opened with three things that she thought i did well i really liked points one two and three you made in that talk they really resonated with me but you have this habit when you are concentrating of looking up and to the right and so you spent half the talk kind of staring at the ceiling or the exit sign in this case instead of making eye contact with the audience and it is distracting and it creates a distance so i thought a little bit about it with my eyes probably rolled up inside my head and i thought oka i can actually make that change it does not feel super scary and so i did i made that change and i thought about how she framed that feedback through this culture of niceness so i want to wish you all luck on your journey of trying to change culture of feedback killing anxious niceness and hopefully have some concrete steps to help you move forward thank you'}\n",
      "Resultado 2: {'text': \"early in my life i learned that there was one thing that could kill a festive mood at a dinner party and that was to talk about me to talk about my life my life as the daughter of a cult leader there was very little that was joking or lighthearted about the first 28 years of my life so i avoided that topic at all costs it was too painful nobody could understand so i became a master at diverting attention at during the conversation on to somebody else but not me i so rarely talked about my life that on the rare occasion when i would slip and somebody would kind of push for me to divulge i could not just casually and comfortably share it i would bond with the story and it would go something like this well i grew up outside of chico and my dad pastured actually a wonderful church there that through the years evolved into a 15,000 member cult it operated and it still operates under the guise of an independent fundamental baptist church but those who have left the followers have tried to leave outsiders even the media it was on 20/20 last year recognize that it is clearly a cult every member was in complete obedience father they did not dare disagree or be disloyal for fear of being publicly ridiculed or punished or banished for doing so they did not go on a vacation without asking my dad's permission and he had said they drink the kool-aid i am not kidding they would have my dad lived a double life one of righteous family man and dynamic speaker in the public eye but one of sordid sexual secrets privately secrets that only my siblings and me and my mom knew he hated my mom hated her treated her terribly abused her and even turned his own children against our mother we hated her he told us she was crazy we thought to make him happy we would hate her too our home was felt full of turmoil hatred stress strife and as a little girl it was isolating it was intense and it was frightening he had affairs had a mistress for many years the wife of a sunday-school teacher built her family a beautiful home right around the corner from our house you could see their family from our back door it was it was craziness living one way preaching another my brother my older brother he became another version of my father he took a he pastured a church in texts was found to have been having affairs with 14 different women divorced that current wife married one of the 14 my father tried desperately to cover it up moved into another church where he was found to have had 17 there was with different women and he just recreated what he had seen my dad with and my dad did nothing but cover it up i felt like i had one main responsibility as a child it was simple but daunting and that was to keep all the secrets there were so many you see he had taught us that the best way to please god was to please him because he was god's man and he taught us that to please him we had to keep all the secrets we could not even tell our best friends what went on in our home because we might be the causes for the destruction of his ministry i literally feared my very life if i ever talked about my dad's ministry but what went on in our home for fear that it would hurt his ministry i was so afraid and the greater the secrets the greater the fear and the greed of my determination to keep quiet i gotta tell you the money part of it was pretty nice as a kid i mean think about it tithes and offerings from 50,000 people know it created a lavish lifestyle for our family my father owned most of the city where the church was he owned to college to high schools to great schools a cemetery blocks of buildings he was very wealthy and even into our adult years he owned us he owned our homes our cars our furniture he owned our lives and we did not dare cross him because we were to her whose everything he died a multimillionaire he left nothing to his children he left everything to the organization which my younger sister and her husband now need and they still perpetuate his legacy the strict rules the undying loyalty and they still try to keep all the secrets i never understood why was i the only one that the four kids so tortured by the hypocrisy so disturbed by the mind control over thousands and thousands of people and so determined to find a better life why was i the only one that insisted on answers to my questions and why was i the only one that ultimately broke away and cut ties with the brainwashing the oppression the fear the secrets and the life that had never been my life i finally walked away when i was about 28 years of age then being estranged from my entire family and i did not see my family again until many years later at my dad's funeral okay see what i mean not a story to share at a dinner party i really got to the point after i left dinner that i could not talk about me for one thing who would understand for another thing it was too hard it hurt too bad so i made a mental note and permanent marker that said must never talk about my life and for many years i did not i could not however wonderful things had happened through the years since their therapy a lot of therapy deprogramming freedom from the mind control and i began to heal and learn and accept and forgive and even learn to be thankful that bizarre life that i had because i realized i was learning some amazing lessons from not only being there but from having the guts to leave and i now have values that are deeply carved in my very soul from that instead of these you do not get for reading a book or from a workshop or another person bellies that are only this deeply ingrained when you live what i live because my dad was a cult leader i now embrace three values and no one will ever take these away from me the first one is freedom to explore my own interests freedom to live within my own value system freedom to determine my own value system freedom to believe what i believe and never stifle what i believe freedom to disagree for you to ask questions and require honest answers freedom to learn who i am and freedom to love who i am the second value was truth i learned pretty quickly that i was not going to be very free until i dealt with what was true and that was hard for me truth was a scary word for me because i mean my entire life i had never been allowed to speak of what went on in our home i had never told even my best friends what went on in our house being truthful was one of the scariest things i could think of i learned that secrets grown in the dark but when exposed to the light of truth they start to lose their power many person my dear amazing therapist in callas texts who nurtured me and who loved me through years and years of healing she used to say to me kinda you are only as sick as your secrets you are only as sick as your secrets so i stopped keeping secrets and as scared as i was in my late is i finally began to deal with what was true i think it finally began to speak what was true and eventually learned how to live openly only in truth and the third value is courage did you know that you actually cannot have freedom or truth if you have no courage is a requirement for both you may desire to live in complete free and the complete truth but if you are lacking and courage you will live in neither one in my late is i had a tiny shred of courage not much but it was all i needed because my desire to live and be free and honest was somewhat great but that teeny shred of courage that i had was enough to allow me to walk away i have a plaque on my desk that i have had for years and it is gone with me everywhere i have ever moved it says the secret to happiness is freedom and the secrets of freedom is courage and that resonated with me i knew it was not going to be happy unless i was free but i knew i was not going to be free my second some courage to get out of there i had to cling to and act upon that tiny shred of courage in order to finally leave a cult the only friends i never know my childhood connections my history my family knowing that in doing so i finally have what i had longed for my entire life and that was freedom true freedom truth courage three words that maybe kind of trite and overused to some people to me they are the air that i breathe values upon which i insist on living and loving in my life oh and one other thing i actually know about you sharing my story talking about me i now recognize that it is in sharing my story and i can so passionately share with you my values gained over 28 years not an emotional prison that kept my heart under lock and key and kept my mind for knowing what i knew you know i sometimes wonder if perhaps living in the absence of our values is what can most clearly determine what indeed our values are and for me i really believe that the apes and the denial of created the presence of for so many years i was denied freedom truth and courage and now i will never let them go not to worry you are still not going to find me at a dinner party he is talking about my childhood not going to happen you will not find me sitting around elaborating over my father who took a wonderful church and turn it into a fifty thousand member cult i still know that is a mood killer i get it but you will find me here and in other appropriate settings especially if i can help somebody talking about my life with sincere gratitude for all that i have learned in spite of and because of living in the absence of freedom truth and courage and thank god i now have by now you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 3: {'text': \"i am here to help you do even more unzipping of your minds and of your hearts moxie clay came out here and challenged your expectations and i am going to ask you to unzip and let your expectations fall out and push them aside all together because they are holding you back expectations are those lists of things what are expectations we build up that tell us how things should be they keep us feeling safe and they also often prevent us from being fully present in our lives and from living to our highest potential so i am going to tell you about my journey away from expectation which also turned out to be a journey toward self empowerment and hope and then how it might apply to your relationships as well i first learned about the power of letting go of expectation on my journey back to my natural family my birth family i am adopted and my adoption is a fairly standard post world war two story in great brain my natural parents live next door to each other in a small town near the east coast of scotland and when they finished high school they went to the west of scotland to glasgow a whopping 38 miles away my father went to heathers story glasgow university my mother went to nursing school and when she became pregnant they decided they were going to get married but they were going to wait and tell their families when they went home on christian break so they expected to end that year by becoming a family that was remember 1966 what they got instead was a tearful break up outside my father's garage from my mother that was followed by a stay at a mothering home a daughter who left the hospital before she did a bill for my foster care and ultimately my adoption my father paid penance by working as a bricklayer for a year before he to university in edinburgh they never saw each other again whatever expectations they had were letting go of expectations shattered on top of that they were told that they should be grateful privileged that they had a chance to redeem themselves and move on this is all pretty standard stuff for that time in place and i am telling you this because i want to note that although my parents learned not to expect in the wake of our separation this is not the productive kind of letting go the kind of letting go that they learned is rooted in shame and in punishment there is not any hope in it it is about shutting down and what i would like us to do today is learn how to let go and open up so fast-forward 18 years from that tearful breakup in the garage my adoptive father my dad had made it clear that he would totally understand if i wanted to go and find my natural family this is a lot easier in scotland than it is here they do not alter birth certificates the adoptee has the rights to all the records so i took myself off to the house of records in edinburgh and got hold of my birth certificate it had my birth name my mother's name her then address it took me another 18 years to decide to search the lead up to that would take another tedtalk or two mostly something had shifted inside me on a trip back in 2003 i walked past the house listed on the birth certificate and i just could not let it go after that i was led entirely by my gut i kind of had to be adoptee are less than i of the population only a few of assert and only a fraction of the people who search actually wind up being in reunion there are not enough of us for there to be a guidebook and for me this turned out to be a good thing it did help that i had had my own child my first child in somewhat similar circumstances to my own birth it also helped that i knew two other friends who were adoptee who were in reunion they had gone into the reunion with a litany of expectations one friend was in a relationship with her natural father that could best be termed as clandestine the other friend's father drank himself into ice the first time they met their relationships with all their natural families were fraught to say the least so i went in with an awareness of the letting go of hope risks i looked clearly at the risks and i decided to go ahead i went in also trying to pare back to what i really hoped without the expectation and what i hoped was to find my natural mother i wanted to know where i came from yes part of me did want the opah style reunion you know the one where you go and the whole gigantic attractive successful natural family welcomes the adoptee on whom they have been waiting their whole lives but i did not go expecting it i pared back and back to what was driving the hope i knew i had to hang on to that i knew i had to be whole and i had to expect nothing when i felt ready to do that i contacted birth link in scotland this is a nonprofit agency that helps adoptee and their families connect with each other i put my name on the list for a searcher that takes some months so in the waiting time i searched more deeply within myself i asked myself all kinds of odd questions what would i do if i found my mother and she was dying and needed my help what would i make of it if i found her and she was alcoholic obese if she was destitute a retired prostitute and i realized that anything that would bother me deeply would do so because i already saw it as a weakness in myself in other words anything i might want her to change was really something i wanted to change in myself i believe this is also called owning your own stuff owning your own stuff also talk to my brother he is also adopted and he said look heather the only thing you really have to worry about is if you go to meet her and she comes to the door with her bags packed and goes alright darling we are we going cut she thinks she is moving in with you anything else you can just run away from start is often good for a little bit of comedy with some truth embedded and he was right either one of us could end the relationship at any moment and is not that the case with all our relationships we behave as though in our relationships especially our significant ones we behave as though we are operating with some kind of a relationship union like a pipe fitters union that is going to uphold our expectation contract but the truth is relationships live in a right-to-work state any party and sometimes a third party like sudden death can end the contract with no notice and no cause and that is a scary truth to face but as with any other no guidebook truth all the expectation in the world cannot stop it what i knew what my net natural parents and i had lived for nearly four decades before we came face-to-face is that expectation does not guarantee you a thing so i entered the relationship knowing the risks i entered the relationship owning what i brought i entered the relationship without that guidebook and here's the good thing about there not being a guidebook there are not any articles about what a good reunion looks like like the articles you read that imply that all the other married couples have more sex than you the skinny woman next door eats cherry pie for breakfast the other guy's business makes more money than yours and it is more fun to work there all the things that build up our expectations and they record chances of honoring what is right in front of us so when i entered the relationship in this rest in way what i found that i was able to really rest in and notice small moments and to take joy there i noticed for instance the grain of my mother's freckled hand wrapped around her mug of tea the first time we met i got to experience her with the surest sureness of adulthood and the heart of a child i did not have my expectation checklist running through my head that is what expectations do they tend to run through our head act like a third party in our relationship constantly vying for our attention and that feels okay when things match up but even then we have stepped away from the moment and the relationship to check in with them and when things do not measure up then we really go aside we start talking to expectation asking it for affirmation he should have brought me flowers should not he she should run those meetings on time and our expectation list says oh yes honey you are right get back in there and make them do it your way so you keep asking and asking and getting grumpier and grumpier when things do not measure up if you have asked a couple of times and you have not gotten the response you wanted you are probably not going to get it and in that stepping away to measure up with expectation you have missed the moment and the relationship as it unfolded that might have offered a path forward and even when the worst thing happens when your expectations are not met and another path forward is not on offer you are then resting in the truth and you can choose to move yourself forward from the truth of that relationship in that moment expectation does not stop painful stuff from happening it just blames it on somebody else what expectations do is pull us out of the moment they hold us in an infinite loop of false possibility so i challenge you today to free yourself from this loop of false possibility before you leave this building this afternoon think of one relationship that has one unfulfilled expectation in it let the expectation go search yourself own your stuff commit to entering your next interaction in that relationship without the expectation hanging on to some hope and then just allowing yourself to fully rest in the reality of the moment whatever needs or wants you might have it is possible that those can be met in some other way but not by this person at this moment settle your heart to that and then move yourself forward i think you will find that if you can be brave enough to rest in reality human and flawed and possibly beautiful reality it will take you places better than you have ever dared to expect\"}\n",
      "Resultado 4: {'text': \"what keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life if you were going to invest now in your future best self where would you put your time and your energy there was a recent survey of millennial asking them what their most important life goals were and over 80 % said that a major life goal for them was to get rich and another 50 % of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous and we are constantly told to lean in to work to push harder and achieve more we are given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them those pictures are almost impossible to get most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but 2020. we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative but what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study many people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy we did that the hazard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that is ever been done for 75 years we have tracked the lives of 724 men year after years asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball further down the field but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived about 60 of our original 724 men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s. and we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men and i am the fourth director of the study since 1938, we have tracked the lives of two groups of men the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at hazard college they all finished college during world war i and then most went off to serve in the war and the second group that we have followed was a group of boys from button's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boson of the 1930s. most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed they were given medical exams we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top and some made that journey in the opposite direction the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today 75 years later telling you that the study still continues every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives many of the inner city boson men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just is not that interesting the hazard men never ask that question to get the clearest picture of these lives we do not just send them questionnaires we interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records from their doctors we draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said it is about time so what have we learned what are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we have generated on these lives well the lessons are not about wealth or fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get from this 75 year study is this good relationships keep us happier and healthier period we have learned three big lessons about relationships the first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier they are physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five america will report that they are lonely and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that it is not just the number of friends you have and it is not whether or not you are in a committed relationship but it is the quality of your close relationships that matters it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health high conflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective once we had followed our men all all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who was not and when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it was not their middle'-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old it was how satisfied they were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men and women reported in their is that on the days when they had more physical pain their moods stayed just as happy but the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain and the third big lesson that we learn about relationships on our health is that good relationships do not just protect our bodies they protect our brains it turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your is is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those people's memories stay sharper longer and the people in relationships where they feel they really cannot count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier memory decline and those good relationships they do not have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments did not take a toll on their memories so this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well'-being, this is wisdom that is as old as the hills why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore well we are human what we would really like is a quick fix something we can get that will make our lives good and keep them that way relationships are messy and they are complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends that is not sexy or glamorous it is also lifelong it never ends the people in our 75'-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates just like the millennial in that recent survey many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life but over and over over these 75 years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let us say you are 25 or you are 40 or you are 60. what might leaning into relationships even look like well the possibilities are practically endless it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member who you have not spoken to in years because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges i would like to close with a quote from mark twain more than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this there is not time so brief is life for bickering apologies heart burnings callings to account there is only time for loving but an instant so to speak for that the good life is built with good relationships thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 5: {'text': \"you could say i had an unconventional childhood for a couple reasons i was born to jewfish avocado and citrus growers in rural southern californium my dad was a surgeon at our local hospital and my mom ran the ranch where we sold our fruit commercially and they rescued donkeys my early childhood was so beautiful strange and very privileged and you could say that i really had nothing to worry about until i did when i was three and my dad was 42, he was diagnosed with metastatic bone cancer and he was told he had six months to live he had his right leg amputated and he went in for chemo and radiation which in the early 1980s, for bone cancer was especially brutal and then miraculously he did not die first we got a years then we got two then we got five and then we got seven and then when i was eleven the cancer came back and stayed for good we lived between scans like that is how our time was meted out and we lived with the constant ticking clock of mortality we all have a clock like this it is just in my family we could hear ours all the time more often than not one of his scans turned up something back tumor here a neck tumor there his other knees and then he would go in for treatment and then he would come back to us it was a little bit like a sinister version of the giving tree only he was trading body parts for time with us and then as i mentioned when i was eleven really he found out this is what was going to kill him and quickly and that is when he decided that he was going to teach my brother and i all the skills we would need to know to survive without him and so while other kids were having play dates after school and riding their bikes my brother and i were in my dad's version of survival school and we were learning all kinds of things how to squish a man's eyeballs out if i was ever attacked all about the dewy decimal system i do not know why the role of nitrogen in soil health member nations of the united nations and so much more he was also doing a lot of things to be present for us after he died so things like becoming a beekeeper and putting away enough honey that he knew would not spoil so that we would have it for decades or planting trees around the ranch that would shade and feed us after he was gone or even though i was only twelve at this point he started a coop of doves and put my brother in charge so that he would let them go at my wedding someday throughout it all i knew he was suffering and often in terrible pain even though he really did not like to talk about it and he always used to say that when he could not enjoy life with me my brother and my mom he would die and i took this at face value until one afternoon when i was 16, i went into their medicine cabinet looking for something and i found an unmarked pill bottle with dosage instructions and i just knew it was a terminal prescription it was right to die medication before it was legal i was not made i immediately understood what he had been saying all those years and that he had a plan that there was a level of pain and suffering that he was not willing to experience and i did not say anything to anybody just put it back and left and then six months later we were on the phone and we got into a terrible fight it was so stupid it was about me not wanting to do my college applications and i was so angry and i hung up on him without saying goodbye and without saying i loved him i did not know it but he was about to take his medication and i think when it came down to it saying goodbye to me was just too impossible by the time i got home he was unconscious and i would never hear his voice again i dealt with his death by doubling down on the things he wanted for me i chased academic honors like a drug i played not one but two division one college sports i wrote a book i got my pod and then in my mid thirties i realized i was just completely exhausted i had been living my entire adult life in a way to prove to myself that i was good because someone who is good is not someone who hangs up on her dying dad i was using achievement and all of the shiny things that come along with it as a way of anesthetizing my own bad feelings of shame regret and fear those feelings were so big i worried that if i let myself feel them for even a minutes i would never ever feel anything else again but you cannot kill negative feelings sadly with work and avoidance and mine came back with a jolt on the outside i was successful and thriving and on the inside i was anxious terrified and questioning my worth by avoiding all of the negative feelings i was muting the fantastic ones too i was so scared about missing out and losing more of the best things in life joy awe love wonderland that i could not even let myself experience them i needed to find a new way to be i wanted to find a new way to be so i did a bunch of stuff i interviewed a ton of grief specialists and therapists and i even went out into the wilderness with no food and no tent to do the thing that scared me most which was to be alone with my own thoughts and feelings and absolutely nothing to distract me from them i learned i can go about five days without eating about a week without talking to anyone and forever without checking my phone but what hit me the hardest was becoming a volunteer at a grief support organization for kids so many of them thought they were bad too they would been out of the room playing when their mom died or they would said something in anger to an ill parent that they regretted and i could so clearly see that the painful things that happened to these kids were not their fault for the first time i was able to see that that was probably true for me too by blaming themselves the kids were making their losses make sense even though it hurt to blame themselves it gave them a reason for the terrible thing that happened like losing someone they love for no reason at all maybe some of you can related often when we feel difficult things we blame ourselves because it is easier than admitting we have no control that is what i had been doing for the 25 years since my dad died but just because you feel guilt and shame does not mean you did something wrong just because you feel regret does not necessarily mean you should have acted differently it sounds very simple and it is very hard to accept but life is nothing except one long sushi conveyor belt of things that are going to test you and teach you at the same time i know this because first i lost my dad but then we lost our family home to wildfire the house and everything in it burned including almost everything that my dad had worked so hard hard to do and leave for us after he died and yet in one small wooden shed that i do not know how this was spared by the fire behind a bunch of old farming equipment we found a couple five gallon plastic buckets of my dad's honey he would harvested it more than 30 years earlier and it was still perfect the ancient egyptians used honey as a sweetener and also as a natural antibiotics on one papyrus it was written that when the sun god cried his tears fell to earth and became bees that made honey for the people life from grief pain into sweetness sorrow into medicine two years after the fire i lost my mom also to cancer but quickly this time she chose right to die too which was legal now and because of the experience we would had with my dad we vowed that this time would be totally different no one would be left wondering if they messed up or if she knew how much she meant to them so we had a living memorial service for her and we each took turns telling her how much she meant to us and she said the same thing back it was so beautiful and it also really hurt i think if you can swing it everyone deserves the chance to say goodbye what i know now and what i wish i could tell my younger self is that you cannot have joy without pain you cannot have resilience without challenges happiness without sadness or bravery without fear these things are not opposites they are partners there is no such thing as happily ever after i am sorry there is only sadly happy and happily sad and that is enough it is more than enough honestly i like to think that before we enter this world we are asked to sign a kind of cosmic release form acknowledging the extreme risk it is to care deeply about anyone or anything or any place i imagine it goes something like this i hereby acknowledge that in exchange for the chance to live i must accept both pain and pleasure joy and sorrow often at the exact same time this is the ticket price for the chance that is to live it is never too late to sign it thank you\"}\n"

      "Resultado 1: {'text': \"early in my life i learned that there was one thing that could kill a festive mood at a dinner party and that was to talk about me to talk about my life my life as the daughter of a cult leader there was very little that was joking or lighthearted about the first 28 years of my life so i avoided that topic at all costs it was too painful nobody could understand so i became a master at diverting attention at during the conversation on to somebody else but not me i so rarely talked about my life that on the rare occasion when i would slip and somebody would kind of push for me to divulge i could not just casually and comfortably share it i would bond with the story and it would go something like this well i grew up outside of chico and my dad pastured actually a wonderful church there that through the years evolved into a 15,000 member cult it operated and it still operates under the guise of an independent fundamental baptist church but those who have left the followers have tried to leave outsiders even the media it was on 20/20 last year recognize that it is clearly a cult every member was in complete obedience father they did not dare disagree or be disloyal for fear of being publicly ridiculed or punished or banished for doing so they did not go on a vacation without asking my dad's permission and he had said they drink the kool-aid i am not kidding they would have my dad lived a double life one of righteous family man and dynamic speaker in the public eye but one of sordid sexual secrets privately secrets that only my siblings and me and my mom knew he hated my mom hated her treated her terribly abused her and even turned his own children against our mother we hated her he told us she was crazy we thought to make him happy we would hate her too our home was felt full of turmoil hatred stress strife and as a little girl it was isolating it was intense and it was frightening he had affairs had a mistress for many years the wife of a sunday-school teacher built her family a beautiful home right around the corner from our house you could see their family from our back door it was it was craziness living one way preaching another my brother my older brother he became another version of my father he took a he pastured a church in texts was found to have been having affairs with 14 different women divorced that current wife married one of the 14 my father tried desperately to cover it up moved into another church where he was found to have had 17 there was with different women and he just recreated what he had seen my dad with and my dad did nothing but cover it up i felt like i had one main responsibility as a child it was simple but daunting and that was to keep all the secrets there were so many you see he had taught us that the best way to please god was to please him because he was god's man and he taught us that to please him we had to keep all the secrets we could not even tell our best friends what went on in our home because we might be the causes for the destruction of his ministry i literally feared my very life if i ever talked about my dad's ministry but what went on in our home for fear that it would hurt his ministry i was so afraid and the greater the secrets the greater the fear and the greed of my determination to keep quiet i gotta tell you the money part of it was pretty nice as a kid i mean think about it tithes and offerings from 50,000 people know it created a lavish lifestyle for our family my father owned most of the city where the church was he owned to college to high schools to great schools a cemetery blocks of buildings he was very wealthy and even into our adult years he owned us he owned our homes our cars our furniture he owned our lives and we did not dare cross him because we were to her whose everything he died a multimillionaire he left nothing to his children he left everything to the organization which my younger sister and her husband now need and they still perpetuate his legacy the strict rules the undying loyalty and they still try to keep all the secrets i never understood why was i the only one that the four kids so tortured by the hypocrisy so disturbed by the mind control over thousands and thousands of people and so determined to find a better life why was i the only one that insisted on answers to my questions and why was i the only one that ultimately broke away and cut ties with the brainwashing the oppression the fear the secrets and the life that had never been my life i finally walked away when i was about 28 years of age then being estranged from my entire family and i did not see my family again until many years later at my dad's funeral okay see what i mean not a story to share at a dinner party i really got to the point after i left dinner that i could not talk about me for one thing who would understand for another thing it was too hard it hurt too bad so i made a mental note and permanent marker that said must never talk about my life and for many years i did not i could not however wonderful things had happened through the years since their therapy a lot of therapy deprogramming freedom from the mind control and i began to heal and learn and accept and forgive and even learn to be thankful that bizarre life that i had because i realized i was learning some amazing lessons from not only being there but from having the guts to leave and i now have values that are deeply carved in my very soul from that instead of these you do not get for reading a book or from a workshop or another person bellies that are only this deeply ingrained when you live what i live because my dad was a cult leader i now embrace three values and no one will ever take these away from me the first one is freedom to explore my own interests freedom to live within my own value system freedom to determine my own value system freedom to believe what i believe and never stifle what i believe freedom to disagree for you to ask questions and require honest answers freedom to learn who i am and freedom to love who i am the second value was truth i learned pretty quickly that i was not going to be very free until i dealt with what was true and that was hard for me truth was a scary word for me because i mean my entire life i had never been allowed to speak of what went on in our home i had never told even my best friends what went on in our house being truthful was one of the scariest things i could think of i learned that secrets grown in the dark but when exposed to the light of truth they start to lose their power many person my dear amazing therapist in callas texts who nurtured me and who loved me through years and years of healing she used to say to me kinda you are only as sick as your secrets you are only as sick as your secrets so i stopped keeping secrets and as scared as i was in my late is i finally began to deal with what was true i think it finally began to speak what was true and eventually learned how to live openly only in truth and the third value is courage did you know that you actually cannot have freedom or truth if you have no courage is a requirement for both you may desire to live in complete free and the complete truth but if you are lacking and courage you will live in neither one in my late is i had a tiny shred of courage not much but it was all i needed because my desire to live and be free and honest was somewhat great but that teeny shred of courage that i had was enough to allow me to walk away i have a plaque on my desk that i have had for years and it is gone with me everywhere i have ever moved it says the secret to happiness is freedom and the secrets of freedom is courage and that resonated with me i knew it was not going to be happy unless i was free but i knew i was not going to be free my second some courage to get out of there i had to cling to and act upon that tiny shred of courage in order to finally leave a cult the only friends i never know my childhood connections my history my family knowing that in doing so i finally have what i had longed for my entire life and that was freedom true freedom truth courage three words that maybe kind of trite and overused to some people to me they are the air that i breathe values upon which i insist on living and loving in my life oh and one other thing i actually know about you sharing my story talking about me i now recognize that it is in sharing my story and i can so passionately share with you my values gained over 28 years not an emotional prison that kept my heart under lock and key and kept my mind for knowing what i knew you know i sometimes wonder if perhaps living in the absence of our values is what can most clearly determine what indeed our values are and for me i really believe that the apes and the denial of created the presence of for so many years i was denied freedom truth and courage and now i will never let them go not to worry you are still not going to find me at a dinner party he is talking about my childhood not going to happen you will not find me sitting around elaborating over my father who took a wonderful church and turn it into a fifty thousand member cult i still know that is a mood killer i get it but you will find me here and in other appropriate settings especially if i can help somebody talking about my life with sincere gratitude for all that i have learned in spite of and because of living in the absence of freedom truth and courage and thank god i now have by now you\"}\n",

      "Resultado 3: {'text': \"they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions but let us be honest do we really want to live in a world where we no longer maintain good intentions despite how negative and polarizing the world may seem at times many of us are still doing our best to maintain good intentions and positive interactions with each other and yet it can be frustrating sometimes to discover that something that we have said or done was still experienced by someone else as being offensive in response to this it is easy to get stuck in unhealthy extreme reactions such as strongly defending our character from perceived attacks only to realize that we have invalidated someone ease's feelings as a results or maybe we walk on eggshells or jump through every hoop possible to avoid offending anyone only to shame ourselves for making any mistakes or blame others for being too sensitive or maybe we just give up altogether concluding that you know you just cannot make anybody happy these days so why even try i do not know about you but that makes me scared because i do not know how we can maintain good intentions and positive interactions with each other if we are still going around living in fear of even unintentional offenses however i believe there is another way with your help i believe that we can maintain good intentions avoid the shame and blame game and even strengthen interactions with those who we encounter on a regular basis if that is of interest to you then i invite you to join me in learning to accept the inevitability of offense let me explain during my 20-plus years as a marriage and family therapist i have considered it an honor to be welcomed into the emotionally vulnerable spaces of new and seasoned couples through a variety of life circumstances and challenges during that time i have gained a great appreciation for four relationships strengthening principles that have helped not only the couples who i serve but also individual personal and professional relationships in all walks of life this first relationship-strengthening principle comes to life for me during one of my greatest professional joys which is when premarital engaged couples come into my office with a big smile on their face expressing how confident they are that they have found the one who they are to spend the rest of their life with primarily because they never disagree or argue with each other.(laughter) that is when i get a big smile on my face and i say that is awesome you guys are in the right place because i can help you fix that laughter they get confused just like that and they say wait what you want us to argue and fight with each other i reassuringly say not not but i do want you to know that you can disagree with each other and still love each other you can misunderstand each other and not conclude that maybe we were not meant to be for end the relationship prematurely due to seemingly irreconcilable offenses you see no matter how hard you try you will we will all offend someone at some point in time in our lives you know how i know because there is no absolute list of what is offensive and what is not what is offensive changes over time what is offensive to one person is perfectly fine to the next after all you cannot tell someone what they should be offended by and what they should not not only that but what is offensive is not always about an absolute list of right or wrongs but more often something that was said or done that reminds someone of a past hurt and makes them fear that future harm is on the way as a results if you find out that you have unintentionally offended someone i encourage you to resist the temptation to get stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense instead accept the inevitability of offense take the time to learn what made that offensive to the person in front of you and then make every reasonable effort to reduce the likelihood of repeating that offense moving forward the second relationship-strengthening principle that comes to life for me often does so when i see couples believing that if you do not know me by now you will never never know me laughter as if to convey that if you do not instantly understand and know everything about me then you must not truly love me but in reality i found that some of the best and long-lasting couple relationships are the ones that embrace not knowing everything that there is to know about a person instantly but actually appreciate the opportunity to keep the relationship fresh by learning new things about each other for years to come similarly in your personal and professional relationships i encourage you to acknowledge that you cannot know everything there is to know about everyone all the time or put more simply i encourage you to accept the inevitability of ignorance now i do not know about you but i grew up with ignorance as an insult synonymous with lack of intelligence but in reality ignorance is merely the lack of knowledge and if we are honest we all lack knowledge about a variety of different life circumstances including the things that many people find offensive however i do fair warn you if you are informed that you have unintentionally offended someone and the first thing out of your mouth is the justification for how you did not know that it was offensive it is emotionally reasonable for someone else to respond in frustration how could you not know everybody knows that that is offensive except there is nothing that everyone knows not only that but how did you not know that it was offensive maybe you were never taught by someone important to you that it was offensive maybe you never personally experienced the hurt that would have taught you that was offensive maybe you were never surrounded by people who experienced the hurt that would have taught you by witnessing that it was offensive how could you not know or how could you also know what makes this not just another insensitive defensive excuse is that we can learn to accept the inevitability of ignorance as a temporary state turning that accusation into an opportunity to reduce our ignorance by increasing our knowledge and using that knowledge to reduce the likelihood of the next offense moving forward the third relationship-strengthening principle comes to life for me when i see couples stuck in the reasonable yet futile search for perfect communication for while healthy communication is essential to a good relationship it is also perfectly reasonable for partners to use the same words but mean completely different things based on their family of origin and life experiences even before meeting each other this often results in partners getting stuck in a defensive battle protecting themselves from perceived threats that were never really attacks in the first place but unhealthily expressed pleas for understanding support and empathy similarly in your personal and professional relationships i encourage you to learn to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding for even our reasonable intentions can result in unintentionally negative impacts leading others to feel the need to protect themselves from us as a perceived threat but wait a minutes why would you be a perceived threat if all you have is good intentions well consider this for a moment consider the possibility that before their encounter with you they experienced nine times of someone else saying the exact same thing or doing the exact same thing that you did but after each of those times it was followed by a hurtful experience then you come along the tenth person to do or say that exact thing despite your reasonable intentions it is also reasonable for them to see the pattern and to fear similar harm from you it is because of this that if you find out that you have unintentionally offended someone i encourage you to resist the temptation of getting stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense and instead ask yourself am i really being attacked or have i simply reminded them of a past hurt and made them fear the future harm is on the way if that is even a remote possibility in your life i encourage you to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding and channel your efforts into the fourth relationship-strengthening strategy which is to learn to reassure the hurt person that you are not the threats that they fear that you are you see when my couples get stuck in a defensive battle protecting themselves from perceived threats and misrepresentations what turns things around is not more explanations and justifications it is instead when one or both partners can get to the point of saying i see better than i did before your past hurts i see the impact that they have had on your current unmet needs and i want to come alongside of you to help make your future better than your hurtful past similarly in your personal and professional relationships i encourage you to look for opportunities to reassure a hurt person that you are not the threat that they fear that you are how can you do this well it can start with a verbal acknowledgment of the limitations of your intentions recognizing that your intent does not always determine your impact but some of you even here may actually resent intentions but i find that many people do not actually resent intentions because they actually have a problem with good intentions but more often because people have received the gift of good intentions being offered instead of what they really need changed behavior you can separate yourself from these experiences by making sure that your verbal acknowledgment of reassurance is always followed by a meaningful behavioral change showing that your commitment is more than just words but action showing to make their future better than their hurtful past now i am not really here to tell you one more thing that you should already be doing but might not be doing not i am here to tell you what the next person who you unintentionally offend needs you to do they need you to accept the inevitability of offense getting stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense does less to help that person than your efforts to reduce the likelihood of the next offense they need you to accept the inevitability of ignorance you do not need to know everything about everyone all the time but you can accept what you do not know value what you do know and learn more one experience at a time they need you to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding acknowledging that your intent does not always determine your impact and they need you to reassure hurt persons that you are not the threat that they fear that you are you can do this with flexibility and openness to change but not change out of correction for being a bad person but change out of consideration for the welling of someone else you never know you might be the one in your environment to reduce the likelihood of the next misunderstanding-influenced divorce friendship breakup job resignation or even cultural cancellation all often influenced by unintentional offenses and just like my couples i want you to know that you do not have to live in fear of even unintentional offenses instead you can accept the inevitability of offense make every reasonable effort to reduce the frequency of those offenses and move forward repairing and strengthening every relationship you encounter thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 4: {'text': \"i am here to help you do even more unzipping of your minds and of your hearts moxie clay came out here and challenged your expectations and i am going to ask you to unzip and let your expectations fall out and push them aside all together because they are holding you back expectations are those lists of things what are expectations we build up that tell us how things should be they keep us feeling safe and they also often prevent us from being fully present in our lives and from living to our highest potential so i am going to tell you about my journey away from expectation which also turned out to be a journey toward self empowerment and hope and then how it might apply to your relationships as well i first learned about the power of letting go of expectation on my journey back to my natural family my birth family i am adopted and my adoption is a fairly standard post world war two story in great brain my natural parents live next door to each other in a small town near the east coast of scotland and when they finished high school they went to the west of scotland to glasgow a whopping 38 miles away my father went to heathers story glasgow university my mother went to nursing school and when she became pregnant they decided they were going to get married but they were going to wait and tell their families when they went home on christian break so they expected to end that year by becoming a family that was remember 1966 what they got instead was a tearful break up outside my father's garage from my mother that was followed by a stay at a mothering home a daughter who left the hospital before she did a bill for my foster care and ultimately my adoption my father paid penance by working as a bricklayer for a year before he to university in edinburgh they never saw each other again whatever expectations they had were letting go of expectations shattered on top of that they were told that they should be grateful privileged that they had a chance to redeem themselves and move on this is all pretty standard stuff for that time in place and i am telling you this because i want to note that although my parents learned not to expect in the wake of our separation this is not the productive kind of letting go the kind of letting go that they learned is rooted in shame and in punishment there is not any hope in it it is about shutting down and what i would like us to do today is learn how to let go and open up so fast-forward 18 years from that tearful breakup in the garage my adoptive father my dad had made it clear that he would totally understand if i wanted to go and find my natural family this is a lot easier in scotland than it is here they do not alter birth certificates the adoptee has the rights to all the records so i took myself off to the house of records in edinburgh and got hold of my birth certificate it had my birth name my mother's name her then address it took me another 18 years to decide to search the lead up to that would take another tedtalk or two mostly something had shifted inside me on a trip back in 2003 i walked past the house listed on the birth certificate and i just could not let it go after that i was led entirely by my gut i kind of had to be adoptee are less than i of the population only a few of assert and only a fraction of the people who search actually wind up being in reunion there are not enough of us for there to be a guidebook and for me this turned out to be a good thing it did help that i had had my own child my first child in somewhat similar circumstances to my own birth it also helped that i knew two other friends who were adoptee who were in reunion they had gone into the reunion with a litany of expectations one friend was in a relationship with her natural father that could best be termed as clandestine the other friend's father drank himself into ice the first time they met their relationships with all their natural families were fraught to say the least so i went in with an awareness of the letting go of hope risks i looked clearly at the risks and i decided to go ahead i went in also trying to pare back to what i really hoped without the expectation and what i hoped was to find my natural mother i wanted to know where i came from yes part of me did want the opah style reunion you know the one where you go and the whole gigantic attractive successful natural family welcomes the adoptee on whom they have been waiting their whole lives but i did not go expecting it i pared back and back to what was driving the hope i knew i had to hang on to that i knew i had to be whole and i had to expect nothing when i felt ready to do that i contacted birth link in scotland this is a nonprofit agency that helps adoptee and their families connect with each other i put my name on the list for a searcher that takes some months so in the waiting time i searched more deeply within myself i asked myself all kinds of odd questions what would i do if i found my mother and she was dying and needed my help what would i make of it if i found her and she was alcoholic obese if she was destitute a retired prostitute and i realized that anything that would bother me deeply would do so because i already saw it as a weakness in myself in other words anything i might want her to change was really something i wanted to change in myself i believe this is also called owning your own stuff owning your own stuff also talk to my brother he is also adopted and he said look heather the only thing you really have to worry about is if you go to meet her and she comes to the door with her bags packed and goes alright darling we are we going cut she thinks she is moving in with you anything else you can just run away from start is often good for a little bit of comedy with some truth embedded and he was right either one of us could end the relationship at any moment and is not that the case with all our relationships we behave as though in our relationships especially our significant ones we behave as though we are operating with some kind of a relationship union like a pipe fitters union that is going to uphold our expectation contract but the truth is relationships live in a right-to-work state any party and sometimes a third party like sudden death can end the contract with no notice and no cause and that is a scary truth to face but as with any other no guidebook truth all the expectation in the world cannot stop it what i knew what my net natural parents and i had lived for nearly four decades before we came face-to-face is that expectation does not guarantee you a thing so i entered the relationship knowing the risks i entered the relationship owning what i brought i entered the relationship without that guidebook and here's the good thing about there not being a guidebook there are not any articles about what a good reunion looks like like the articles you read that imply that all the other married couples have more sex than you the skinny woman next door eats cherry pie for breakfast the other guy's business makes more money than yours and it is more fun to work there all the things that build up our expectations and they record chances of honoring what is right in front of us so when i entered the relationship in this rest in way what i found that i was able to really rest in and notice small moments and to take joy there i noticed for instance the grain of my mother's freckled hand wrapped around her mug of tea the first time we met i got to experience her with the surest sureness of adulthood and the heart of a child i did not have my expectation checklist running through my head that is what expectations do they tend to run through our head act like a third party in our relationship constantly vying for our attention and that feels okay when things match up but even then we have stepped away from the moment and the relationship to check in with them and when things do not measure up then we really go aside we start talking to expectation asking it for affirmation he should have brought me flowers should not he she should run those meetings on time and our expectation list says oh yes honey you are right get back in there and make them do it your way so you keep asking and asking and getting grumpier and grumpier when things do not measure up if you have asked a couple of times and you have not gotten the response you wanted you are probably not going to get it and in that stepping away to measure up with expectation you have missed the moment and the relationship as it unfolded that might have offered a path forward and even when the worst thing happens when your expectations are not met and another path forward is not on offer you are then resting in the truth and you can choose to move yourself forward from the truth of that relationship in that moment expectation does not stop painful stuff from happening it just blames it on somebody else what expectations do is pull us out of the moment they hold us in an infinite loop of false possibility so i challenge you today to free yourself from this loop of false possibility before you leave this building this afternoon think of one relationship that has one unfulfilled expectation in it let the expectation go search yourself own your stuff commit to entering your next interaction in that relationship without the expectation hanging on to some hope and then just allowing yourself to fully rest in the reality of the moment whatever needs or wants you might have it is possible that those can be met in some other way but not by this person at this moment settle your heart to that and then move yourself forward i think you will find that if you can be brave enough to rest in reality human and flawed and possibly beautiful reality it will take you places better than you have ever dared to expect\"}\n",
      "Resultado 5: {'text': \"as i have been recently hearing about disturbing sad news i often think about the idea of loving yourself we have been taught to love other people as an important value but i think loving our own selves has not been considered to be an issue worth talking about why it may be because it is too obvious that we love ourselves to take up the issue and stress the importance all of us cannot avoid being egoistic sometimes we want to have things our own way if everything in our life is going well can we love ourselves not necessarily so the reason why it is hard to discuss 'self-love' may be that it has a kind of a narcissistic whiff and sounds a little icky to people if we saw somebody looking in the mirror saying how i love myself do not bother me!'... i am not talking about myself we would want to say suit yourself keep looking in the mirror i want to say it does not have to be like that to love ourselves life is not always easy it would be of course nice if we were happy all our life but in our life many people might say i hate you or i wish you would disappear from this world going through the agony we ultimately reach the realization that we have to love ourselves in the sense of taking responsibility for ourselves and looking after ourselves if when people tell us i hate you we respond to it by saying eyes i hate myself too the moment we said so i am sure we would lose our desire to go on living i have felt the need for that kind of attitude more than once myself since we do not know what will happen in the future the kind of situation in which we have to love ourselves might arise again in the sense of needing to take care of ourselves it would be wonderful if you could live a trouble-free life for a quite long time i could not figure out what kind of person i was when i did something good for others people showed appreciation to me and then i thought i was basically a pretty good person like that i had occasions that made me feel relieved on the other hands when i would really hurt someone i was very disappointed in myself feeling like i was fundamentally a cruel person to love ourselves actually may be harder than to love any other person because we know ourselves thoroughly through and through looking back at all we have done in the past and remembering boy i did such things as this and that...' and not only the good things we have done but unpleasant things we have done also come back at us can we love ourselves with knowing all those sides of us at this point i thought in our thought process there must be something fundamentally wrong then i started by doing this to change it first i honestly looked back at myself seeing a pretty good person or one not so good and for the time being i accepted all my 'selves,' good or bad instead of being judgmental about myself thinking i may be a nice guy at heart or i may be basically a cruel person which one is really me i decided to accept all my selves as parts of myself and thought about why i had so many varied selves in this one person to sum it up it is in response to different people and different situations when i talk to my grandmother i am very relaxed when i talk to people at work i may sound serious putting on a serious look talking about difficult things when i talk to somebody who rubs me the wrong way you can bet the tone of my voice cannot be this calm i try not to come into contact with such a person in the first place in any case each self of mine has its own uniqueness to love each self of mine equally in order to love myself may be very difficult but i can say i love my self when i am with this person i become somebody whom i even abhor when i am with that person but i like my self pretty well when i am with this particular person i am not too bad in fact to love ourselves may not be that hard after all take romance suppose there are two girls and i have feelings toward both of them one day i have a date with one of them and have dinner with her i enjoy being with her talking a lot frequently interjecting jokes smiling at each other and we interact with each other very well then suddenly i notice it is the time for the last train i rush to the train station to catch the last one and at home i am happy with myself as for the other girl i also like her but during our date i cannot talk or joke that much... and we often get awkward silences i feel like a miserable loser i do not feel like going on with her so after having dinner we say goodbye to each other after the two dates if i were asked which one i would rather see again i would choose the first one without hesitation there is no doubt i like her but rather because i like my self when i am with her i enjoy my self when i am with her and find life worth living in the life of that self of mine the definition of love may be to love somebody else this surely is not wrong but what i would like to add to it is rather to love means with the help of the person we love for us to be able to love ourselves that is what i would like to think i can reveal my inner self as i wish without any difficulties being true to myself when i am with that person and it will never happen with anybody else unfortunately some of our relationships come to end some end out of disputes others end due to death when we grieve over losing our loved ones we miss the voice and hug of the person and many other things but i wonder if we may rather be grieving over losing the life of our self who lived with that person thinking only with them could i talk freely like that only with them could i be honest with myself only with them could i be silly like that but that person is gone now and i cannot live the life of that self of mine i love any longer i wonder if that is what we really grieve over and of course vice versus if somebody says to me i love you i will be euphoric yelling 'yes!' but if i were told thanks to you i come to love myself or i love myself when i am with you more than when i am with anybody else that would be something which strikes my heart more that my existence validates one person's existence that way moves me with a deep joy something poignant each time when we find one self we love we may be finding our foothold we need to go on living in our life we feel like we need to be loved by many people a certain percentage of people in our groups in our class our workplace but not that many of those selves we love may be necessary if we find two or three of our selves we love in ourselves we can go on with those as our foothold five or six may be more than enough you may think you only have 3 friends in your class at school or you may think three that many friends who help you like yourself all depends on how you take it to love ourselves does not mean saying i am crazy about myself looking into a mirror but instead it means with the help of or via somebody else for us to come to love ourselves it is probably where we start really loving ourselves and that is why as we feel the need we love others as indispensable individuals that is all i want to say thank you\"}\n"

      "Resultado 1: {'text': \"what keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life if you were going to invest now in your future best self where would you put your time and your energy there was a recent survey of millennial asking them what their most important life goals were and over 80 % said that a major life goal for them was to get rich and another 50 % of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous and we are constantly told to lean in to work to push harder and achieve more we are given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them those pictures are almost impossible to get most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but 2020. we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative but what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study many people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy we did that the hazard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that is ever been done for 75 years we have tracked the lives of 724 men year after years asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball further down the field but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived about 60 of our original 724 men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s. and we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men and i am the fourth director of the study since 1938, we have tracked the lives of two groups of men the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at hazard college they all finished college during world war i and then most went off to serve in the war and the second group that we have followed was a group of boys from button's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boson of the 1930s. most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed they were given medical exams we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top and some made that journey in the opposite direction the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today 75 years later telling you that the study still continues every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives many of the inner city boson men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just is not that interesting the hazard men never ask that question to get the clearest picture of these lives we do not just send them questionnaires we interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records from their doctors we draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said it is about time so what have we learned what are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we have generated on these lives well the lessons are not about wealth or fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get from this 75 year study is this good relationships keep us happier and healthier period we have learned three big lessons about relationships the first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier they are physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five america will report that they are lonely and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that it is not just the number of friends you have and it is not whether or not you are in a committed relationship but it is the quality of your close relationships that matters it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health high conflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective once we had followed our men all all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who was not and when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it was not their middle'-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old it was how satisfied they were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men and women reported in their is that on the days when they had more physical pain their moods stayed just as happy but the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain and the third big lesson that we learn about relationships on our health is that good relationships do not just protect our bodies they protect our brains it turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your is is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those people's memories stay sharper longer and the people in relationships where they feel they really cannot count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier memory decline and those good relationships they do not have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments did not take a toll on their memories so this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well'-being, this is wisdom that is as old as the hills why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore well we are human what we would really like is a quick fix something we can get that will make our lives good and keep them that way relationships are messy and they are complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends that is not sexy or glamorous it is also lifelong it never ends the people in our 75'-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates just like the millennial in that recent survey many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life but over and over over these 75 years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let us say you are 25 or you are 40 or you are 60. what might leaning into relationships even look like well the possibilities are practically endless it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member who you have not spoken to in years because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges i would like to close with a quote from mark twain more than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this there is not time so brief is life for bickering apologies heart burnings callings to account there is only time for loving but an instant so to speak for that the good life is built with good relationships thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 2: {'text': \"all right hello so i have had a lifelong fascination with how we organize how we humans work together to express some work or some purpose in the world and i would like to start by sharing a story bit about my journey it is a story that is true and it is become a bit of a metaphor for my own my own path i have a private a harrowing experience pilot's license and when i was first learning to fly i had a rather harrowing experience i am up in the plane i am still a student pilot i have 20-some hours of flight time i yes they let you fly a plane alone with 20-some hours of practice so i am up in this plane it is my first cross-country solo flight so the first time i am flying hundreds of miles away from home with no instructor with me and i am all ready for the journey i go up i start flying little nervous and the low voltage light comes on they do not teach you much about how the plane works right barely not apply the thing so you know what do i do well my first instinct is to you know tap the low voltage light but that does not change anything my next instinct is to check my other instruments to see if there is a big problem here right so one by one i check all of my other instruments the altimeter says you are not losing altitude there is nothing wrong all right the navigation aid says you are perfectly on course congratulations everything's fine the airspeed indicator says you are not losing speed you are flying fast everything's great so i let those other instruments outvote the low voltage light yeah i figured nothing else is reporting anything anomalous it must not be that big of a problem right that was a really bad idea turns out who would have thought that low voltage light is actually tuned in to different information than every other instrument on that control panel oops i nearly crashed the plane that day and fortunately i did make it down there were some steps in the middle there i will skip for you but i made it down and after the adrenaline wears off it occurs to me we do this in our organizations all the time when we humans show up in organizations we become the sensors the instruments for that organizations flight towards its purpose we sense reality on its behalf it is through us that it becomes aware of whatever it needs to deal with or do in the world and we humans are different and we sense different things we have different talents backgrounds different types different talents we sense different things and it is sometimes something sensed by only one person or by the many minority that is critical to integrate into how we proceed and we often ignore them and this really echoed my experience back when i worked in more conventional organizations that was my experience i showed up in a company i wanted to be a sensor for this company i wanted to be an instrument i sensed reality and i wanted to do something with it and i am sure all of you have had the experience of going into some organization somewhere and sensing something important maybe it is a hole in a process or a way to improve something that is not working as well as it could be something slipping through the cracks and i would often have those experiences but have nothing i could do to act on them right there would be no way to integrate that into the organization in fact i no way to integrate learned early on that if the boss did not sense it i was not gonna get it processed have you ever seen that you know you sense something important but the boss just does not see it good luck that shuts down the organization's capacity to integrate and harness whatever it was that i tuned in to find the low-voltage light were in trouble so my quest since then has been how can we humans show up as sensors for our organizations and i did the only logical thing i was i became a boss this is more personal now how can i show up and to be a sensor for organization the only logical thing once i realized that anything i sensed that the boss did not was not gonna get address well i became a boss right that is nice and simple now i get to really run things the way i think they should be you know and unfortunately i realized there was still another boss you know so after climbing the corporate ladder a bit i got fed up with that and realized all right the only way i am really going to be able to process anything my sense is if i drop out of this whole game and start my own company where i get to be the coo at the top and now there is no boss getting in the way of processing whatever it is i am sensing so i did that i started a software company and built it over many years and you know at first that worked great i could get a lot of the stuff i sensed processed but then something unfortunate happened i realized well i am not even able to even as the coo as this company's growing i am not even able to take everything that i see and get it processed the systems are not responsive enough right the way we have structured and built our organizations today does not let me even as the coo get everything i sense integrated and harnessed and processed and that was not actually the worst of it the far more painful realization was i had just built the very system that i had struggled so long and tried to move past right now everyone else in that company did not get whatever it was that they could tune into and sense harnessed and integrated unless i saw it and no matter how much i might work on myself focus on my own development try to be the most empowering servant leader i can be the reality is i am still a human i still have bad days i still miss things right and i had built the very system that i had tried to escape so my question then shifted a bit it became how do i build something different and how do i build a system where that is not the case where anything since by anyone can integrate and change the organization to help it better express whatever work it is doing in the world so one of the things we attention realized is there is incredible energy there in the things we sense when we tune in to a gap between where we are and what could be right we call this attention because we often sense it as tension right that it is not just intellectual it is that feeling in your gut the frustration that comes when you see a process that you know could be better or you are banging your head into the same damn problem multiple times you feel tense you feel this tension about it could also be an opportunity if something exciting but it is this gap between where we are and where you sense we could be and just like a rubber band stretched between two points there is such energy there although we often tension experience it as a negative i do not mean it that way at all and if we can do something with it becomes energy not frustration right the root of the word tension in satin tense era means to stretch it is a stretch so how can we power an organization fuel its continual evolution its continual updating how it works and how we work together based on these tensions that we sense so interesting question hard thing to do and we tried a lot of things so we experimented over years we tried running an organization via consensus seemed like a good idea at the time it was a complete disaster if you ever want to sit in long painful meetings all the time and never get anything done try running your organization with consensus what i realized was there is a consensus big difference between having a voice and actually being able to do something with your voice being able to actually process everything you sense into some kind of meaningful change consensus did not do it in fact often that would result in long painful meetings where we all tried to get everyone to see it the same way i do not want my low voltage light to have to see things the same way as my fuel gauge i do not need that and it is not a healthy system in fact i want to let each of them sense what they can sense best and all integrate into the flight plan so how can we have an organization where any tension sense by anyone anywhere in the company has someplace to go to get rapidly and reliably processed into meaningful change that was the question consensus did not work so we tried other things and we started finding approaches we started coming up with something and one of the first things we realized on that journey is we actually need to harness autocratic harness autocratic authority the very thing we moved away from in the beginning right autocratic authority because if we are sensing on behalf of the organization and we want to be dynamic and fast and responsive which we have to be to process everything everyone senses most of the things we sense we need to act on locally we need to be not just sensors but actors in this system and to do that we need the authority to act without having to go to a painful meeting and try to get everybody bought into every decision you want to make in cells in the human body other words we need to be a lot more like cells in the human body each one needs a clear boundary within which it has autonomy that has authority but what you do not see is a coo cell right a manager cell directing the others what to do each cell has its own autonomy but it is distributed that is the direction we moved in a system where everybody has autocratic authority but they know the bounds of their authority they know the interconnections they know when they have to get somebody ease's input or when they have to integrate with someone they know the bounds of their authority and the connections they know what they the process can expect of each other and in most organizations we have managers to fill the central point to do that to align all of us and to distribute authority but we have already covered the limits of that so how can we do that without managers in the way well for that we need a process if we do not have managers to align and integrate we need a process which aligns and integrates a process which lets each of us be a sovereign autonomous agent on behalf of this organization and its purpose and integrate in other words we need something that is a lot less like a feudal hierarchy and a lot more like a constitutional entity and that is exactly what we have so in my organization i work in every day i get to experience this it is quite liberating in my organization now we have no coo we have no managers every individual partner in that firm has real authority that no one else can trump but it is distributed we each have different authority and we know the bounds and the limits of each and we have a constitution that defines how we integrate together a constitution that defines a governance process which is not governed of the people by the people for the people but rather is governance of the organization through the people as sensors for the purpose whatever it is we are here to do together when we have that kind of tangible system real processes that hold and distribute real authority and integrate us and figure out how do we need to interconnect and align expectations when that process allows everyone to have a voice for the sake of the purpose and when you have a process to integrate anything you sense conclusion anything you sense whatsoever any constraint on expressing this this purpose in the world and you can integrate it and change and reshape the organization dynamically in real time reshape how we work together what authority everyone has you have got a system that is dramatically more responsive and adaptable without the waste of managers in the way limiting what tensions you can process all of this we have captured in what we call a new social technology for organizations it is a new operating system it is tangible that constitutions available on our website and you can find it you can find organizations running with it all over the world now it is spreading is called holacracy you can find more at our website holacracy or and learn a bit more about how this system aligns us to each to the purpose each of us to the purpose while giving us the freedom and autonomy and yet an integrated whole thank you\"}\n",

daughter of a cult leader there was very little that was joking or lighthearted about the first 28 years of my life so i avoided that topic at all costs it was too painful nobody could understand so i became a master at diverting attention at during the conversation on to somebody else but not me i so rarely talked about my life that on the rare occasion when i would slip and somebody would kind of push for me to divulge i could not just casually and comfortably share it i would bond with the story and it would go something like this well i grew up outside of chico and my dad pastured actually a wonderful church there that through the years evolved into a 15,000 member cult it operated and it still operates under the guise of an independent fundamental baptist church but those who have left the followers have tried to leave outsiders even the media it was on 20/20 last year recognize that it is clearly a cult every member was in complete obedience father they did not dare disagree or be disloyal for fear of being publicly ridiculed or punished or banished for doing so they did not go on a vacation without asking my dad's permission and he had said they drink the kool-aid i am not kidding they would have my dad lived a double life one of righteous family man and dynamic speaker in the public eye but one of sordid sexual secrets privately secrets that only my siblings and me and my mom knew he hated my mom hated her treated her terribly abused her and even turned his own children against our mother we hated her he told us she was crazy we thought to make him happy we would hate her too our home was felt full of turmoil hatred stress strife and as a little girl it was isolating it was intense and it was frightening he had affairs had a mistress for many years the wife of a sunday-school teacher built her family a beautiful home right around the corner from our house you could see their family from our back door it was it was craziness living one way preaching another my brother my older brother he became another version of my father he took a he pastured a church in texts was found to have been having affairs with 14 different women divorced that current wife married one of the 14 my father tried desperately to cover it up moved into another church where he was found to have had 17 there was with different women and he just recreated what he had seen my dad with and my dad did nothing but cover it up i felt like i had one main responsibility as a child it was simple but daunting and that was to keep all the secrets there were so many you see he had taught us that the best way to please god was to please him because he was god's man and he taught us that to please him we had to keep all the secrets we could not even tell our best friends what went on in our home because we might be the causes for the destruction of his ministry i literally feared my very life if i ever talked about my dad's ministry but what went on in our home for fear that it would hurt his ministry i was so afraid and the greater the secrets the greater the fear and the greed of my determination to keep quiet i gotta tell you the money part of it was pretty nice as a kid i mean think about it tithes and offerings from 50,000 people know it created a lavish lifestyle for our family my father owned most of the city where the church was he owned to college to high schools to great schools a cemetery blocks of buildings he was very wealthy and even into our adult years he owned us he owned our homes our cars our furniture he owned our lives and we did not dare cross him because we were to her whose everything he died a multimillionaire he left nothing to his children he left everything to the organization which my younger sister and her husband now need and they still perpetuate his legacy the strict rules the undying loyalty and they still try to keep all the secrets i never understood why was i the only one that the four kids so tortured by the hypocrisy so disturbed by the mind control over thousands and thousands of people and so determined to find a better life why was i the only one that insisted on answers to my questions and why was i the only one that ultimately broke away and cut ties with the brainwashing the oppression the fear the secrets and the life that had never been my life i finally walked away when i was about 28 years of age then being estranged from my entire family and i did not see my family again until many years later at my dad's funeral okay see what i mean not a story to share at a dinner party i really got to the point after i left dinner that i could not talk about me for one thing who would understand for another thing it was too hard it hurt too bad so i made a mental note and permanent marker that said must never talk about my life and for many years i did not i could not however wonderful things had happened through the years since their therapy a lot of therapy deprogramming freedom from the mind control and i began to heal and learn and accept and forgive and even learn to be thankful that bizarre life that i had because i realized i was learning some amazing lessons from not only being there but from having the guts to leave and i now have values that are deeply carved in my very soul from that instead of these you do not get for reading a book or from a workshop or another person bellies that are only this deeply ingrained when you live what i live because my dad was a cult leader i now embrace three values and no one will ever take these away from me the first one is freedom to explore my own interests freedom to live within my own value system freedom to determine my own value system freedom to believe what i believe and never stifle what i believe freedom to disagree for you to ask questions and require honest answers freedom to learn who i am and freedom to love who i am the second value was truth i learned pretty quickly that i was not going to be very free until i dealt with what was true and that was hard for me truth was a scary word for me because i mean my entire life i had never been allowed to speak of what went on in our home i had never told even my best friends what went on in our house being truthful was one of the scariest things i could think of i learned that secrets grown in the dark but when exposed to the light of truth they start to lose their power many person my dear amazing therapist in callas texts who nurtured me and who loved me through years and years of healing she used to say to me kinda you are only as sick as your secrets you are only as sick as your secrets so i stopped keeping secrets and as scared as i was in my late is i finally began to deal with what was true i think it finally began to speak what was true and eventually learned how to live openly only in truth and the third value is courage did you know that you actually cannot have freedom or truth if you have no courage is a requirement for both you may desire to live in complete free and the complete truth but if you are lacking and courage you will live in neither one in my late is i had a tiny shred of courage not much but it was all i needed because my desire to live and be free and honest was somewhat great but that teeny shred of courage that i had was enough to allow me to walk away i have a plaque on my desk that i have had for years and it is gone with me everywhere i have ever moved it says the secret to happiness is freedom and the secrets of freedom is courage and that resonated with me i knew it was not going to be happy unless i was free but i knew i was not going to be free my second some courage to get out of there i had to cling to and act upon that tiny shred of courage in order to finally leave a cult the only friends i never know my childhood connections my history my family knowing that in doing so i finally have what i had longed for my entire life and that was freedom true freedom truth courage three words that maybe kind of trite and overused to some people to me they are the air that i breathe values upon which i insist on living and loving in my life oh and one other thing i actually know about you sharing my story talking about me i now recognize that it is in sharing my story and i can so passionately share with you my values gained over 28 years not an emotional prison that kept my heart under lock and key and kept my mind for knowing what i knew you know i sometimes wonder if perhaps living in the absence of our values is what can most clearly determine what indeed our values are and for me i really believe that the apes and the denial of created the presence of for so many years i was denied freedom truth and courage and now i will never let them go not to worry you are still not going to find me at a dinner party he is talking about my childhood not going to happen you will not find me sitting around elaborating over my father who took a wonderful church and turn it into a fifty thousand member cult i still know that is a mood killer i get it but you will find me here and in other appropriate settings especially if i can help somebody talking about my life with sincere gratitude for all that i have learned in spite of and because of living in the absence of freedom truth and courage and thank god i now have by now you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 4: {'text': \"maya angel once said a solitary fantasy can transform a million realities what dream or vision do you want to turn into reality i always wanted to go into business for myself i could be a consultant i am going to go gluten free right after i eat that last piece of chocolate cake laughter you know one day i am going to stand up to that crabby boss i look good on paper i should feel great i just know there is more you know it because you feel it you lie awake at night you talk about your dreams with your partner and your friends but more often than not you continue to do those same behaviors that keep you from making the change you ask yourself how can i make it happened research shows the odds against you making a change in your life i i 9 to 1. 9 to i even if you are facing a life-threatening illness but let me show you how to beat those odds you can live the life you desire it is right there in front of you but in order to achieve it you must first see it then believe it and then you must graciously ask and train your brain to help you execute your vision so how do we see our vision through a picture a picture can create movement a picture... can unite nations a picture can pull at your heart and fill you with a deep desire to do something at rochet pharmaceutical the president asked us to create a picture of his vision prior to having one less than 40 percent of the employees understood the company's vision and strategy after seeing this picture 96 percent understood it and 84 percent understood how what they did everyday align to that picture so how can you use a picture to get what you want by simply drawing one you do not have to be an artist or know how to draw as naive as your drawings might be when you draw where you are your current state and where you want to be your desired new reality suddenly you have a road map for change so what is your current state well let us say you are joey job has a good job job has a lovely wife amyl job makes good money but like many of us job wants more from life and he would like to get rid of a couple of things maybe that intense workload maybe that negative boss maybe job has a higher purpose he is just not sure how to get there so now job's current state is visual we remember things better when they are attached to a picture 65 percent better to be exact so now let us imagine that job wants to change something in his current state he wants to build that desired new reality that he dreams about in order for job to freely dream he must first... ...trick his brain because the left side of your brain as you know houses the critics who is forever trying to keep you safe from harm make sure you do not do anything dangerous or stupid so let us have job tell the critic that he is just going to use his imagination using your imagination activates the right side of your brain which makes you creative and filled with possibility so now let us dream job's new life in the best case scenario one year from today what is job's life like hey job has a new job great job has a new boss himself job has a couple of great collaborators and job is just bursting with creativity and ideas and all of those things we dream about connection and purpose and freedom and love now i am drawing this picture as the favor to job today but in real life he would have to draw his own picture because he cannot afford me laughter actually because you get the most power when you paint your own picture so now job has his drawing so now he is got to soak it in he has to fill it with color he has to fill it with emotions he has to get inside of it as if he is on the inside looking out your brain actually emits serotonin and oxytocin when you draw and dream so you feel happy capable creative you feel cool so now we have job's current state and job's desired new reality so how can job get from here to there in just three bold steps three bold steps if i knew how to get from here to there in three bold steps i would have done it 25 years ago when i had a mullet laughter here is where the magic begins your brain knows you it is cataloged everything you have ever seen heard experienced real or imagined you just have to ask it to put the pieces together for you it as simple as that we live in a three-dimensional world but the light falls on the retina in a two-dimensional fashion and the brain it has to cope with it so how does it deal with this extra dimension it guesses it guesses and just as it can guess where your cup of coffee is when it goes to pick it up it can correctly guess what the three bold steps are that you should take all you have to do is look at your picture and then close your eyes this allows the brain to recycle what it sees and reconstruct it add to it everything you have ever seen heard experienced or fantasized about and then it will serve you up with the best possible solution if you just relax and you ask it now what is the boldest thing i could do to get from here to there boom immediately it will tell you see it believe it act on it now the danger is if any of those three bold steps are too scary this instinctual rational side of your brain is going to try to talk you out of this oh not not not i do not want to do that... oh that desk it is not too small my legs are not cramped under there oh 20,000 a years oh that is a decent salary oh that boss he is not that mean to me you know what i am just going to stay right here i feel really comfortable here so how can you get yourself to do the boldest thing by drawing the most compelling picture so when you look here you are in pain it hurts when you are here you are ecstatic it is fantastic you are already living inside that connected and free life you drew so everyday you get up you soak in your picture you step into the possibility and this is the most important part you act on it you do one small thing you call up that friend you know who started her own business you ask her how did you do it you ask amyl will you support me in my vision you go to your boss and you ask him for a raise and you become that one person out of ten to make change happen now i put this template on your chairs so that you can do for yourself what i just did for joey you have seen some fantastic ideas today that have inspired your dream i dare you to draw that dream into that template i double dare you to choose a symbol in your drawing that represents that desired new reality take a picture of it with your phone and send it to us at tedxrainier. maya angel said a solitary fantasy can transform a million realities just three bold steps can transform one reality yours thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 5: {'text': \"they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions but let us be honest do we really want to live in a world where we no longer maintain good intentions despite how negative and polarizing the world may seem at times many of us are still doing our best to maintain good intentions and positive interactions with each other and yet it can be frustrating sometimes to discover that something that we have said or done was still experienced by someone else as being offensive in response to this it is easy to get stuck in unhealthy extreme reactions such as strongly defending our character from perceived attacks only to realize that we have invalidated someone ease's feelings as a results or maybe we walk on eggshells or jump through every hoop possible to avoid offending anyone only to shame ourselves for making any mistakes or blame others for being too sensitive or maybe we just give up altogether concluding that you know you just cannot make anybody happy these days so why even try i do not know about you but that makes me scared because i do not know how we can maintain good intentions and positive interactions with each other if we are still going around living in fear of even unintentional offenses however i believe there is another way with your help i believe that we can maintain good intentions avoid the shame and blame game and even strengthen interactions with those who we encounter on a regular basis if that is of interest to you then i invite you to join me in learning to accept the inevitability of offense let me explain during my 20-plus years as a marriage and family therapist i have considered it an honor to be welcomed into the emotionally vulnerable spaces of new and seasoned couples through a variety of life circumstances and challenges during that time i have gained a great appreciation for four relationships strengthening principles that have helped not only the couples who i serve but also individual personal and professional relationships in all walks of life this first relationship-strengthening principle comes to life for me during one of my greatest professional joys which is when premarital engaged couples come into my office with a big smile on their face expressing how confident they are that they have found the one who they are to spend the rest of their life with primarily because they never disagree or argue with each other.(laughter) that is when i get a big smile on my face and i say that is awesome you guys are in the right place because i can help you fix that laughter they get confused just like that and they say wait what you want us to argue and fight with each other i reassuringly say not not but i do want you to know that you can disagree with each other and still love each other you can misunderstand each other and not conclude that maybe we were not meant to be for end the relationship prematurely due to seemingly irreconcilable offenses you see no matter how hard you try you will we will all offend someone at some point in time in our lives you know how i know because there is no absolute list of what is offensive and what is not what is offensive changes over time what is offensive to one person is perfectly fine to the next after all you cannot tell someone what they should be offended by and what they should not not only that but what is offensive is not always about an absolute list of right or wrongs but more often something that was said or done that reminds someone of a past hurt and makes them fear that future harm is on the way as a results if you find out that you have unintentionally offended someone i encourage you to resist the temptation to get stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense instead accept the inevitability of offense take the time to learn what made that offensive to the person in front of you and then make every reasonable effort to reduce the likelihood of repeating that offense moving forward the second relationship-strengthening principle that comes to life for me often does so when i see couples believing that if you do not know me by now you will never never know me laughter as if to convey that if you do not instantly understand and know everything about me then you must not truly love me but in reality i found that some of the best and long-lasting couple relationships are the ones that embrace not knowing everything that there is to know about a person instantly but actually appreciate the opportunity to keep the relationship fresh by learning new things about each other for years to come similarly in your personal and professional relationships i encourage you to acknowledge that you cannot know everything there is to know about everyone all the time or put more simply i encourage you to accept the inevitability of ignorance now i do not know about you but i grew up with ignorance as an insult synonymous with lack of intelligence but in reality ignorance is merely the lack of knowledge and if we are honest we all lack knowledge about a variety of different life circumstances including the things that many people find offensive however i do fair warn you if you are informed that you have unintentionally offended someone and the first thing out of your mouth is the justification for how you did not know that it was offensive it is emotionally reasonable for someone else to respond in frustration how could you not know everybody knows that that is offensive except there is nothing that everyone knows not only that but how did you not know that it was offensive maybe you were never taught by someone important to you that it was offensive maybe you never personally experienced the hurt that would have taught you that was offensive maybe you were never surrounded by people who experienced the hurt that would have taught you by witnessing that it was offensive how could you not know or how could you also know what makes this not just another insensitive defensive excuse is that we can learn to accept the inevitability of ignorance as a temporary state turning that accusation into an opportunity to reduce our ignorance by increasing our knowledge and using that knowledge to reduce the likelihood of the next offense moving forward the third relationship-strengthening principle comes to life for me when i see couples stuck in the reasonable yet futile search for perfect communication for while healthy communication is essential to a good relationship it is also perfectly reasonable for partners to use the same words but mean completely different things based on their family of origin and life experiences even before meeting each other this often results in partners getting stuck in a defensive battle protecting themselves from perceived threats that were never really attacks in the first place but unhealthily expressed pleas for understanding support and empathy similarly in your personal and professional relationships i encourage you to learn to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding for even our reasonable intentions can result in unintentionally negative impacts leading others to feel the need to protect themselves from us as a perceived threat but wait a minutes why would you be a perceived threat if all you have is good intentions well consider this for a moment consider the possibility that before their encounter with you they experienced nine times of someone else saying the exact same thing or doing the exact same thing that you did but after each of those times it was followed by a hurtful experience then you come along the tenth person to do or say that exact thing despite your reasonable intentions it is also reasonable for them to see the pattern and to fear similar harm from you it is because of this that if you find out that you have unintentionally offended someone i encourage you to resist the temptation of getting stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense and instead ask yourself am i really being attacked or have i simply reminded them of a past hurt and made them fear the future harm is on the way if that is even a remote possibility in your life i encourage you to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding and channel your efforts into the fourth relationship-strengthening strategy which is to learn to reassure the hurt person that you are not the threats that they fear that you are you see when my couples get stuck in a defensive battle protecting themselves from perceived threats and misrepresentations what turns things around is not more explanations and justifications it is instead when one or both partners can get to the point of saying i see better than i did before your past hurts i see the impact that they have had on your current unmet needs and i want to come alongside of you to help make your future better than your hurtful past similarly in your personal and professional relationships i encourage you to look for opportunities to reassure a hurt person that you are not the threat that they fear that you are how can you do this well it can start with a verbal acknowledgment of the limitations of your intentions recognizing that your intent does not always determine your impact but some of you even here may actually resent intentions but i find that many people do not actually resent intentions because they actually have a problem with good intentions but more often because people have received the gift of good intentions being offered instead of what they really need changed behavior you can separate yourself from these experiences by making sure that your verbal acknowledgment of reassurance is always followed by a meaningful behavioral change showing that your commitment is more than just words but action showing to make their future better than their hurtful past now i am not really here to tell you one more thing that you should already be doing but might not be doing not i am here to tell you what the next person who you unintentionally offend needs you to do they need you to accept the inevitability of offense getting stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense does less to help that person than your efforts to reduce the likelihood of the next offense they need you to accept the inevitability of ignorance you do not need to know everything about everyone all the time but you can accept what you do not know value what you do know and learn more one experience at a time they need you to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding acknowledging that your intent does not always determine your impact and they need you to reassure hurt persons that you are not the threat that they fear that you are you can do this with flexibility and openness to change but not change out of correction for being a bad person but change out of consideration for the welling of someone else you never know you might be the one in your environment to reduce the likelihood of the next misunderstanding-influenced divorce friendship breakup job resignation or even cultural cancellation all often influenced by unintentional offenses and just like my couples i want you to know that you do not have to live in fear of even unintentional offenses instead you can accept the inevitability of offense make every reasonable effort to reduce the frequency of those offenses and move forward repairing and strengthening every relationship you encounter thank you\"}\n"

than just words but action showing to make their future better than their hurtful past now i am not really here to tell you one more thing that you should already be doing but might not be doing not i am here to tell you what the next person who you unintentionally offend needs you to do they need you to accept the inevitability of offense getting stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense does less to help that person than your efforts to reduce the likelihood of the next offense they need you to accept the inevitability of ignorance you do not need to know everything about everyone all the time but you can accept what you do not know value what you do know and learn more one experience at a time they need you to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding acknowledging that your intent does not always determine your impact and they need you to reassure hurt persons that you are not the threat that they fear that you are you can do this with flexibility and openness to change but not change out of correction for being a bad person but change out of consideration for the welling of someone else you never know you might be the one in your environment to reduce the likelihood of the next misunderstanding-influenced divorce friendship breakup job resignation or even cultural cancellation all often influenced by unintentional offenses and just like my couples i want you to know that you do not have to live in fear of even unintentional offenses instead you can accept the inevitability of offense make every reasonable effort to reduce the frequency of those offenses and move forward repairing and strengthening every relationship you encounter thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 2: {'text': 'it is not true what they say that you cannot love anyone until you love yourself have you heard that people say you have to learn to love yourself before you can love anybody else but it is not true i loved everybody before i loved myself love does not care which way you come or what state you are in when you get here love welcomes everyone unconditionally oddly so do focus group moderators - laughter which is how and why i learned to do it if you have never been a part of a focus group you are missing a really special cultural experience so in every focus group there is a range of characters right there is always a shy one and a chatty one a grumpy one that does not want to do any of the exercises and a very excited mom with a notebook who wants to get an a plus in all of the exercises laughter there is a student who lied on the intake because they need the money and a dad full of jokes who cannot read the room laughter and usually there is one ex-military guy who keeps staring at the two-way mirror suspiciously laughter it is a situation where a group of people that may not otherwise ever meet have the chance to share their perspectives and it is my job as the moderator to make sure that they all get heard now it is not quite a classroom it is not group therapy and while the community feel has some elements of holiness probably no one would call it a spiritual experience i mean no one else because moderating rooms of strange and difficult voices is what taught me to welcome all the strange and difficult parts of myself no kidding i start every morning meditation with the same opener i use as a focus group moderator thanks everyone for being here laughter your input is valued laughter him going to hear from each of you ill give you all the chance to speak just do your best to be completely present honest and try to make any requests reasonable so i do not know about you but there are a lot of me in here in the mind of are faith ism not referring to psychiatric illness specifically but i do not exclude that laughter my mind has plenty of quirks but what i have to share is for anyone with an inner dialogue though i admit it is especially for those of us with a really noisy one so i noticed some time ago that i was arguing with myself and then i wondered if i did not agree with me who is i and who is me in that scenario and it turned out that there are quite a few of me there is a really sentimental emotional me an intellectual analytical me those two argue a lot there is a me who loves being on stage there is another one who is pretty shaky at the moment some of us - at this time i include you - some of us regard these as feelings or thoughts and maybe we have done our personal homework accepting that we can have conflicting feelings at the same time we can be excited about a new job and also dread going back to work we can be tired and want to stay up we can adore someone who also annoys us we can love someone who has badly betrayed us we know this and when were honest and rational we can see that these are common experiences but were not crazy to both love and hate camping laughter it does me no harm to embrace that i feel both ways about it but what about the thought that ism worthless that i do not belong here the mistakes have made are unforgivable that the bad things that happened in my life were my fault those thoughts are just as real as the rest of them but they are harder to live with and they send many of us to therapy or to yoga or the nearest bar which more or less describes my daily commute for many years laughter because i wanted to silence those thoughts completely and let me tell you i tried i have done every kind of therapy i have ever heard of i have done talk therapy energy healing body work hypnotherapy soul retrieval the tapping stuff the thing with the lights i did seven kinds of yoga i drank the special team with the shaman in the forest laughter i admit i did pass on the acupuncture they do with live honeybees - laughter people do that laughter suffice to say i tried and still sometimes when i was alone i would hear myself shouting shut up or worse to my own mind in my work as a people researchers it is my job to practice empathy with strangers to receive everything i can about their world in order to understand them as deeply as possible now it is noteworthy that i found this career at a temp job writing meeting notes when my supervisor noticed that i was not just paraphrasing conversation i was recording body language micro-expressions, tonal shifts specific verb choices what neither of us knew then is that the qualities which made me seem skillful were the symptoms of complex post-traumatic stress the most reasonable results of an appalling upbringing and a fact i share not to set me apart from you but to welcome you in here with me everyone in this room has walked through something difficult in order to be here and i want you to know that whatever path you have taken to get through it is honorable whether you never talk about it or you write bad poetry about it whether you make tons of money prosecuting it or if you just hit the gym like a champ to sweat it out of your body there is truly no wrong way there are some ways that cause other problems you know the ones laughter have done some of those i still do some of those and i do not judge those either because gifts and curses are buy one get one and mine were no exception my early life gave me heaps of shame and a splintered sense of self - hence all the different mes - but it also gave me super antennas for the emotions of others this hypervigilance made me a certified mess of a person but a damn near-wizard-level observer so i got to work the last 20 years have shadowed people in their homes at their jobs while they shop and drive and go on dates i ask them to be honest and vulnerable with me and to do this i practice something that i call unconditional welcome which is like a researchers neutrality but a little extra the day i discovered it i was sitting in the living room of a research subject she was a very unpleasant woman if ism honest feeding french fries to an infant as she snapped at me that she would never have her children vaccinated not even to protect them from polio because she did not know it was in those shots now never mind that she said this an inch of ash deep into a virgin slim right laughter i was judging her i know ism not proud of it but at least one of me is a jerk laughter i needed to connect with her and i did not want to i did not like her i did not respect her i did not want to spend a single moment with her and the project required that i spend hours and that i used that time to get to know her what she values what she believes where she finds strength researcher neutrality was unavailable to me at the time so i had to get out the big guns i called up my new age visualization skills and i took a deep breath secondhand smoke and all and i imagined that my breath was inflating a shiny soap bubble filled with unconditional welcome not tolerance not even compassion total welcome as is - no comments no notes and as i inflated the bubble it became big enough to contain my whole body and then hers and in that moment i saw a mother feeding her baby in a world that she did not trust i told her that i could see that she cared about protecting her son and i asked her if she got that from her parents and then we had a conversation and i learned about her i learned why she was afraid and angry and how she fought through that fear to make a family when i welcomed this woman unconditionally i saw her more clearly but i also loved her instantly we have been told too often that love is hard it is not love is what happens when we stop trying to figure out who deserves it it is right there when we stop trying to figure out who deserves it and we welcome someone anyone exactly as they are in the moment it will be two more years before i learn to do this with all the parts of myself but it started just as simply a part of me had become very chatty - a part that was afraid and angry whiny demanding unreasonable and relentless she told me that we were never going to get better she wanted out of here i asked her what i could do she only told me she wanted to die over and over and over and over i begged her to shut up and she did not finally after weeks of harassment whether out of exhaustion or epiphany instead of shouting back i took a deep breath i became my own moderator i said out loud in a voice that surprised me thank you for sharing ism going to remind you of our agreement to be honest and reasonable and she answered me - that voice now do not get spooked this is all just thinking happening laughter but the part of me asking and the part answering did in fact seem like different parts she told me that she was in a lot of pain and i told her i know and i promise you ism going to take care of you but i need you to get on board i will listen to you but i will not obey you and as clearly as ism speaking to you now she said okay and then we started to talk as i continue the dialogue with myself i found more of me more voices with more points of view some of them more fun than others and the imagined landscape of my mind began to look a lot like a focus group this round table of wildly mixed characters and one moderator keeping some kind of order with honesty boundaries kindness and most importantly gratitude i thank my selves for their contributions no matter how bonkers or twisted they may seems because were all me i think of my fragmented self less like broken mirror and more like a prism were full spectrum today there is not a voice in my head that i do not welcome and while some of us are occasionally unreasonable were not mean even my whiny shame voice is trying to help in her weird way but when i ask her to be clear and kind she tells me exactly what i need to know what she needs to feel better and what she would like for me to learn but just like the scared and angry mother she only does this when i accept her exactly as she is in the moment so while my openings for self-talk and focus groups sound almost identical the closings are a little different at the round table i would hand out parking validation remind everyone to sign for their cash but when ism with all of me i say i love you thank you for helping me see what you see - which is why this practice is so useful for all of us here with our different perspectives inside and outside of one another if we can receive one another with the curiosity and welcome of a focus group moderator perhaps we can do a better job of love because it is not true what they say that you cannot love anyone until you love yourself love is a house you can crawl in through a window if you cannot start with yourself start with the person next to you right now whether you know them or not all you have to do is let them be here it is easy is not it wherever they have been whatever they are carrying whatever talents they have or do not have whatever mistakes they have made can you just welcome them here can you welcome you were here right now like this were beautiful and strange and complicated and scared and sometimes kind of horrible but all of us are worthy of welcome and everyone that you show unconditional welcome may show you a part of yourself to love you are welcome thank you'}\n",
      "Resultado 3: {'text': \"i have a problem how many times do we say that and we tend to think that it is because we have problems that we struggle in life it is not true if we struggle in life it is because we have parts within ourselves parts who are suffering parts who are afraid and most importantly who believe nothing can be changed this is the reason why we struggle up until a few months ago i thought i had a problem which was that i found it hard to speak about me in public on a personal level but i did oka because as a doctor most often it was related to medical or scientific topics and as a results there was no discomfort until the day i received a call from someone who means a great deal to me and who invited me to talk about my experience on the use of the psychotherapy model which i am introducing to you tonight and that i use at my hospital but he did ask specifically for me to make it personal since it was my experience and i quickly declined his invitation because there was a little voice inside my head telling me you have nothing of interest to say well i thought i was at peace with that but then few weeks or months later that same person calls me up again and again asks for me to present at that time i thought there most certainly was something to unravel here because if this person who means a lot to me asks again for me to come and talk about my experience there is something unfinished about this at first i asked him to give me a little time told him that i needed to think it through and i used this time to look inwards to look inwards to know who was telling me that i had nothing interesting to say to other people on a personal level to do so it is important to take a moment here is how i did it i focused inwards on this voice calmly and in a curious manner who is it at first all i heard was this message you have nothing of interest to say and then as i kept asking i heard something else if this person really knew you he would not ask you to do that he really has no idea who you are you have nothing interesting to say it went on for a while after a while i realized that this voice came from a person a part of me and that this person had all the traits of a critics a judge from within this was an important discovery because i could really become aware of the presence of this person and as a results i could genuinely talk with him ask him questions such as why do you keep on telling me all this why do you have this purpose in my life to criticize me to judge me the way you do what are you afraid of if i did accept the invitation and went to the conference to talk about myself it was really interesting because all of a sudden the tone changed and instead of criticism came something quite moving deep inside i am afraid that you may relive something hard you have experienced before so first i thanked this part for his caring intention and i then asked it know would you agree to step aside and to let me reconnect with this hardship you want to prevent me from reliving he agreed to that and behind this part of me was another part a little boy eight years of age he was standing by the door of the apartment i used to live in at the time he was standing absolutely frozen and he did not know i was there because for all these years the critic was standing between the two of us and so it took a little time for this little boy to realize that i was there and that i was there for him and so we started talking open heatedly i asked him if he would want to tell me about himself his story why he was frozen we took a moment and talked about his suffering his emotions once he turned to me and recognized me and trusted me enough he started explaining to me telling me things things i already knew but he said them again from deep inside his heart told me that he was the youngest of a family who was going through a hard time then with many agencies to deal with and that whenever this little boy wanted to talk about himself there was no room no time for that as a consequences he ended up thinking that what he thought was important to say in his heart was of no interest since nobody cared or so it seemed to him this was an important time because from this moment on he felt completely understood and so i asked him now that he knew i understood him whether he would leave the past behind and be interested to join me in the present whether he was interested in changing his way of life clearly he was and so i told him for this to happen there is something important for you to do it is to get rid of everything linked to this hardship and that still weighs on you he agreed to do so to relieve himself of his burden and to my great surprise i met a bold adventurous little boy very eager to join me and go to this conference once this change had taken place i turned to the critic and asked so how are things for you now do you still need to play this role in my life and once again to my surprise he said no i do not need to anymore i see that you can take care of this boy he is safe now i then asked would you accept to play another part to do something else less difficult less burdening he said woke i will be your adviser now i will assist you so the little boy the adviser and myself got to work we prepared the conference and people quite liked it why did i choose to tell you this story here tonight after all it is a story pertaining to familiar elements being hurt being defensive and maybe one would frown upon such a happy ending still there are key points i want to share with you linked to my own experience both with this little boy but also with the therapy model i came here to tell you about first the importance to meet the parts within ourselves how important this relationship is second why is it stuck inside as a result of what and that not dealing with it will prevent any change thirdly it can change there is a plan be what i did when i looked within was that i connected with it i could have talked to somebody about my problem i even could have mentioned my parts to them but instead i went within myself francs within franchise and connected with these parts first the critics then the boy and this is essential because when a connection is created from within myself changes occur a feeling of security and trust emerges and this allows for an important thing to happen which is for this critic to show himself beyond what he tells me who he truly is his underlying positive intention towards me he wanted to protect me it allows him to take a risk the second thing was why was it all stuck inside why was the boy stuck in the apartment the answer is quite simple it is because of his burden what is his burden it is the suffering which is attached to the hardship and this suffering is still there it was in or on the little boy the little boy was stuck there thinking he was not interesting the problem with the burden and the parts of us bearing it is that these parts absorb it all these parts believe they are the burden itself they forgot that they are merely bearing it they believe they are it and as a results this burden becomes a poison a genuine poison bums in our societies we like them so long as they are far enough from us they are dirty they stink they drink they yell they are unclean and so we tend to stay away from these members of society the same thing happens within ourselves there are parts of ourselves who are not attractive who stink who have experienced such hardships that have come to be unworthy of love because they are not pretty inside and so within ourselves we do the same thing we do with bums we shield ourselves from them and isolate them inside how do we do that well it is quite simple actually there are other parts in us who are quite good at this and create a protective barrier they are called protectors so who are the protectors well they are these parts in us which are linked to our habits our reassuring ways of dealing with things for example taking a little pill before going to bed because it is a little too hard without it or to have a couple of glasses because there is a difficult meeting ahead and we want to be relaxed or this overwhelming urge to succeed in life or to rely on your intellect to understand everything or to do sports because one has to release one's energy somehow and calm one's anxiety all these behaviors which are a little bit over the top which make us feel like we do not really have a choice in the matter these are the protectors within us there are parts within us doing all this and fortunately so because they help us cope with our pain they help prevent us from feeling down and when we feel down because we are in contact with these wounded parts they help us getting away from them because it is just too painful to stay there the problem is that these parts are scared because they know that if they stop what they are doing the fire of pain will rise again in our lives and so this fear prevents them from stopping why well since the wounded parts are convinced that they are their own burden that they are dirty the protective parts have no choice but to protect them and behave in our lives sometimes to extremes even to the point of being destructive either for us or for others this is the first tragedy the second tragedy is that we end up thinking the same thing they do that change is not an option that we are stuck with this forever and that is why it is important to know that there is a plan be plan b is the plan you use whenever what you tried first did not succeed plan a is i am hurt i protect myself plan b is something else it is doing what i did it is going within myself francs within franchise meeting these parts it is important because first it allows for the understanding of the intention the history the pain but mostly it brings security it allows for my protectors your protectors to stand aside enough so that i in a loving way can access these wounded parts and when these parts feel the compassion and love they agree to do what my little boy did which is to release their burden and to come back to their real nature and from then on our protective parts can consider stopping what they do what they are exhausted doing and causes us problems in life this person this francs within francs who could do all this is like a flame inside it is who i really am deep inside of me in the ifs psychotherapy model i am introducing to you tonight the internal family systems model this flame is called the self and i would like to leave you with a message that we share the adviser the little boy and myself this message is that this self is always here no matter what happened to us even the worst situations even in the most chronic situations this flame is always here available as an invitation to our protectors to trust and an invitation to these suffering parts to relieve themselves from their pain an invitation to our parts to relieve themselves from what weighs on them and come back to their true nature thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 4: {'text': \"what keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life if you were going to invest now in your future best self where would you put your time and your energy there was a recent survey of millennial asking them what their most important life goals were and over 80 % said that a major life goal for them was to get rich and another 50 % of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous and we are constantly told to lean in to work to push harder and achieve more we are given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them those pictures are almost impossible to get most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but 2020. we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative but what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study many people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy we did that the hazard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that is ever been done for 75 years we have tracked the lives of 724 men year after years asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball further down the field but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived about 60 of our original 724 men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s. and we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men and i am the fourth director of the study since 1938, we have tracked the lives of two groups of men the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at hazard college they all finished college during world war i and then most went off to serve in the war and the second group that we have followed was a group of boys from button's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boson of the 1930s. most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed they were given medical exams we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top and some made that journey in the opposite direction the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today 75 years later telling you that the study still continues every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives many of the inner city boson men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just is not that interesting the hazard men never ask that question to get the clearest picture of these lives we do not just send them questionnaires we interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records from their doctors we draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said it is about time so what have we learned what are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we have generated on these lives well the lessons are not about wealth or fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get from this 75 year study is this good relationships keep us happier and healthier period we have learned three big lessons about relationships the first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier they are physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five america will report that they are lonely and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that it is not just the number of friends you have and it is not whether or not you are in a committed relationship but it is the quality of your close relationships that matters it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health high conflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective once we had followed our men all all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who was not and when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it was not their middle'-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old it was how satisfied they were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men and women reported in their is that on the days when they had more physical pain their moods stayed just as happy but the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain and the third big lesson that we learn about relationships on our health is that good relationships do not just protect our bodies they protect our brains it turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your is is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those people's memories stay sharper longer and the people in relationships where they feel they really cannot count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier memory decline and those good relationships they do not have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments did not take a toll on their memories so this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well'-being, this is wisdom that is as old as the hills why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore well we are human what we would really like is a quick fix something we can get that will make our lives good and keep them that way relationships are messy and they are complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends that is not sexy or glamorous it is also lifelong it never ends the people in our 75'-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates just like the millennial in that recent survey many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life but over and over over these 75 years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let us say you are 25 or you are 40 or you are 60. what might leaning into relationships even look like well the possibilities are practically endless it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member who you have not spoken to in years because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges i would like to close with a quote from mark twain more than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this there is not time so brief is life for bickering apologies heart burnings callings to account there is only time for loving but an instant so to speak for that the good life is built with good relationships thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 5: {'text': \"early in my life i learned that there was one thing that could kill a festive mood at a dinner party and that was to talk about me to talk about my life my life as the daughter of a cult leader there was very little that was joking or lighthearted about the first 28 years of my life so i avoided that topic at all costs it was too painful nobody could understand so i became a master at diverting attention at during the conversation on to somebody else but not me i so rarely talked about my life that on the rare occasion when i would slip and somebody would kind of push for me to divulge i could not just casually and comfortably share it i would bond with the story and it would go something like this well i grew up outside of chico and my dad pastured actually a wonderful church there that through the years evolved into a 15,000 member cult it operated and it still operates under the guise of an independent fundamental baptist church but those who have left the followers have tried to leave outsiders even the media it was on 20/20 last year recognize that it is clearly a cult every member was in complete obedience father they did not dare disagree or be disloyal for fear of being publicly ridiculed or punished or banished for doing so they did not go on a vacation without asking my dad's permission and he had said they drink the kool-aid i am not kidding they would have my dad lived a double life one of righteous family man and dynamic speaker in the public eye but one of sordid sexual secrets privately secrets that only my siblings and me and my mom knew he hated my mom hated her treated her terribly abused her and even turned his own children against our mother we hated her he told us she was crazy we thought to make him happy we would hate her too our home was felt full of turmoil hatred stress strife and as a little girl it was isolating it was intense and it was frightening he had affairs had a mistress for many years the wife of a sunday-school teacher built her family a beautiful home right around the corner from our house you could see their family from our back door it was it was craziness living one way preaching another my brother my older brother he became another version of my father he took a he pastured a church in texts was found to have been having affairs with 14 different women divorced that current wife married one of the 14 my father tried desperately to cover it up moved into another church where he was found to have had 17 there was with different women and he just recreated what he had seen my dad with and my dad did nothing but cover it up i felt like i had one main responsibility as a child it was simple but daunting and that was to keep all the secrets there were so many you see he had taught us that the best way to please god was to please him because he was god's man and he taught us that to please him we had to keep all the secrets we could not even tell our best friends what went on in our home because we might be the causes for the destruction of his ministry i literally feared my very life if i ever talked about my dad's ministry but what went on in our home for fear that it would hurt his ministry i was so afraid and the greater the secrets the greater the fear and the greed of my determination to keep quiet i gotta tell you the money part of it was pretty nice as a kid i mean think about it tithes and offerings from 50,000 people know it created a lavish lifestyle for our family my father owned most of the city where the church was he owned to college to high schools to great schools a cemetery blocks of buildings he was very wealthy and even into our adult years he owned us he owned our homes our cars our furniture he owned our lives and we did not dare cross him because we were to her whose everything he died a multimillionaire he left nothing to his children he left everything to the organization which my younger sister and her husband now need and they still perpetuate his legacy the strict rules the undying loyalty and they still try to keep all the secrets i never understood why was i the only one that the four kids so tortured by the hypocrisy so disturbed by the mind control over thousands and thousands of people and so determined to find a better life why was i the only one that insisted on answers to my questions and why was i the only one that ultimately broke away and cut ties with the brainwashing the oppression the fear the secrets and the life that had never been my life i finally walked away when i was about 28 years of age then being estranged from my entire family and i did not see my family again until many years later at my dad's funeral okay see what i mean not a story to share at a dinner party i really got to the point after i left dinner that i could not talk about me for one thing who would understand for another thing it was too hard it hurt too bad so i made a mental note and permanent marker that said must never talk about my life and for many years i did not i could not however wonderful things had happened through the years since their therapy a lot of therapy deprogramming freedom from the mind control and i began to heal and learn and accept and forgive and even learn to be thankful that bizarre life that i had because i realized i was learning some amazing lessons from not only being there but from having the guts to leave and i now have values that are deeply carved in my very soul from that instead of these you do not get for reading a book or from a workshop or another person bellies that are only this deeply ingrained when you live what i live because my dad was a cult leader i now embrace three values and no one will ever take these away from me the first one is freedom to explore my own interests freedom to live within my own value system freedom to determine my own value system freedom to believe what i believe and never stifle what i believe freedom to disagree for you to ask questions and require honest answers freedom to learn who i am and freedom to love who i am the second value was truth i learned pretty quickly that i was not going to be very free until i dealt with what was true and that was hard for me truth was a scary word for me because i mean my entire life i had never been allowed to speak of what went on in our home i had never told even my best friends what went on in our house being truthful was one of the scariest things i could think of i learned that secrets grown in the dark but when exposed to the light of truth they start to lose their power many person my dear amazing therapist in callas texts who nurtured me and who loved me through years and years of healing she used to say to me kinda you are only as sick as your secrets you are only as sick as your secrets so i stopped keeping secrets and as scared as i was in my late is i finally began to deal with what was true i think it finally began to speak what was true and eventually learned how to live openly only in truth and the third value is courage did you know that you actually cannot have freedom or truth if you have no courage is a requirement for both you may desire to live in complete free and the complete truth but if you are lacking and courage you will live in neither one in my late is i had a tiny shred of courage not much but it was all i needed because my desire to live and be free and honest was somewhat great but that teeny shred of courage that i had was enough to allow me to walk away i have a plaque on my desk that i have had for years and it is gone with me everywhere i have ever moved it says the secret to happiness is freedom and the secrets of freedom is courage and that resonated with me i knew it was not going to be happy unless i was free but i knew i was not going to be free my second some courage to get out of there i had to cling to and act upon that tiny shred of courage in order to finally leave a cult the only friends i never know my childhood connections my history my family knowing that in doing so i finally have what i had longed for my entire life and that was freedom true freedom truth courage three words that maybe kind of trite and overused to some people to me they are the air that i breathe values upon which i insist on living and loving in my life oh and one other thing i actually know about you sharing my story talking about me i now recognize that it is in sharing my story and i can so passionately share with you my values gained over 28 years not an emotional prison that kept my heart under lock and key and kept my mind for knowing what i knew you know i sometimes wonder if perhaps living in the absence of our values is what can most clearly determine what indeed our values are and for me i really believe that the apes and the denial of created the presence of for so many years i was denied freedom truth and courage and now i will never let them go not to worry you are still not going to find me at a dinner party he is talking about my childhood not going to happen you will not find me sitting around elaborating over my father who took a wonderful church and turn it into a fifty thousand member cult i still know that is a mood killer i get it but you will find me here and in other appropriate settings especially if i can help somebody talking about my life with sincere gratitude for all that i have learned in spite of and because of living in the absence of freedom truth and courage and thank god i now have by now you\"}\n"

      "\n",
      "1. **Acepta los Desaf√≠os**: Un aspecto clave de la mentalidad de crecimiento es ver los desaf√≠os como oportunidades para aprender y crecer. No te desanimes ante las dificultades, en su lugar, preg√∫ntate qu√© puedes aprender de cada situaci√≥n.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Reacciona Positivamente ante el Fracaso**: Aprende a ver el fracaso como una parte normal del proceso de aprendizaje.

      "\n",

recent survey of millennial asking them what their most important life goals were and over 80 % said that a major life goal for them was to get rich and another 50 % of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous and we are constantly told to lean in to work to push harder and achieve more we are given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them those pictures are almost impossible to get most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but 2020. we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative but what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study many people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy we did that the hazard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that is ever been done for 75 years we have tracked the lives of 724 men year after years asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball further down the field but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived about 60 of our original 724 men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s. and we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men and i am the fourth director of the study since 1938, we have tracked the lives of two groups of men the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at hazard college they all finished college during world war i and then most went off to serve in the war and the second group that we have followed was a group of boys from button's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boson of the 1930s. most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed they were given medical exams we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top and some made that journey in the opposite direction the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today 75 years later telling you that the study still continues every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives many of the inner city boson men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just is not that interesting the hazard men never ask that question to get the clearest picture of these lives we do not just send them questionnaires we interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records from their doctors we draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said it is about time so what have we learned what are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we have generated on these lives well the lessons are not about wealth or fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get from this 75 year study is this good relationships keep us happier and healthier period we have learned three big lessons about relationships the first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier they are physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five america will report that they are lonely and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that it is not just the number of friends you have and it is not whether or not you are in a committed relationship but it is the quality of your close relationships that matters it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health high conflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective once we had followed our men all all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who was not and when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it was not their middle'-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old it was how satisfied they were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men and women reported in their is that on the days when they had more physical pain their moods stayed just as happy but the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain and the third big lesson that we learn about relationships on our health is that good relationships do not just protect our bodies they protect our brains it turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your is is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those people's memories stay sharper longer and the people in relationships where they feel they really cannot count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier memory decline and those good relationships they do not have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments did not take a toll on their memories so this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well'-being, this is wisdom that is as old as the hills why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore well we are human what we would really like is a quick fix something we can get that will make our lives good and keep them that way relationships are messy and they are complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends that is not sexy or glamorous it is also lifelong it never ends the people in our 75'-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates just like the millennial in that recent survey many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life but over and over over these 75 years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let us say you are 25 or you are 40 or you are 60. what might leaning into relationships even look like well the possibilities are practically endless it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member who you have not spoken to in years because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges i would like to close with a quote from mark twain more than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this there is not time so brief is life for bickering apologies heart burnings callings to account there is only time for loving but an instant so to speak for that the good life is built with good relationships thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 2: {'text': \"you could say i had an unconventional childhood for a couple reasons i was born to jewfish avocado and citrus growers in rural southern californium my dad was a surgeon at our local hospital and my mom ran the ranch where we sold our fruit commercially and they rescued donkeys my early childhood was so beautiful strange and very privileged and you could say that i really had nothing to worry about until i did when i was three and my dad was 42, he was diagnosed with metastatic bone cancer and he was told he had six months to live he had his right leg amputated and he went in for chemo and radiation which in the early 1980s, for bone cancer was especially brutal and then miraculously he did not die first we got a years then we got two then we got five and then we got seven and then when i was eleven the cancer came back and stayed for good we lived between scans like that is how our time was meted out and we lived with the constant ticking clock of mortality we all have a clock like this it is just in my family we could hear ours all the time more often than not one of his scans turned up something back tumor here a neck tumor there his other knees and then he would go in for treatment and then he would come back to us it was a little bit like a sinister version of the giving tree only he was trading body parts for time with us and then as i mentioned when i was eleven really he found out this is what was going to kill him and quickly and that is when he decided that he was going to teach my brother and i all the skills we would need to know to survive without him and so while other kids were having play dates after school and riding their bikes my brother and i were in my dad's version of survival school and we were learning all kinds of things how to squish a man's eyeballs out if i was ever attacked all about the dewy decimal system i do not know why the role of nitrogen in soil health member nations of the united nations and so much more he was also doing a lot of things to be present for us after he died so things like becoming a beekeeper and putting away enough honey that he knew would not spoil so that we would have it for decades or planting trees around the ranch that would shade and feed us after he was gone or even though i was only twelve at this point he started a coop of doves and put my brother in charge so that he would let them go at my wedding someday throughout it all i knew he was suffering and often in terrible pain even though he really did not like to talk about it and he always used to say that when he could not enjoy life with me my brother and my mom he would die and i took this at face value until one afternoon when i was 16, i went into their medicine cabinet looking for something and i found an unmarked pill bottle with dosage instructions and i just knew it was a terminal prescription it was right to die medication before it was legal i was not made i immediately understood what he had been saying all those years and that he had a plan that there was a level of pain and suffering that he was not willing to experience and i did not say anything to anybody just put it back and left and then six months later we were on the phone and we got into a terrible fight it was so stupid it was about me not wanting to do my college applications and i was so angry and i hung up on him without saying goodbye and without saying i loved him i did not know it but he was about to take his medication and i think when it came down to it saying goodbye to me was just too impossible by the time i got home he was unconscious and i would never hear his voice again i dealt with his death by doubling down on the things he wanted for me i chased academic honors like a drug i played not one but two division one college sports i wrote a book i got my pod and then in my mid thirties i realized i was just completely exhausted i had been living my entire adult life in a way to prove to myself that i was good because someone who is good is not someone who hangs up on her dying dad i was using achievement and all of the shiny things that come along with it as a way of anesthetizing my own bad feelings of shame regret and fear those feelings were so big i worried that if i let myself feel them for even a minutes i would never ever feel anything else again but you cannot kill negative feelings sadly with work and avoidance and mine came back with a jolt on the outside i was successful and thriving and on the inside i was anxious terrified and questioning my worth by avoiding all of the negative feelings i was muting the fantastic ones too i was so scared about missing out and losing more of the best things in life joy awe love wonderland that i could not even let myself experience them i needed to find a new way to be i wanted to find a new way to be so i did a bunch of stuff i interviewed a ton of grief specialists and therapists and i even went out into the wilderness with no food and no tent to do the thing that scared me most which was to be alone with my own thoughts and feelings and absolutely nothing to distract me from them i learned i can go about five days without eating about a week without talking to anyone and forever without checking my phone but what hit me the hardest was becoming a volunteer at a grief support organization for kids so many of them thought they were bad too they would been out of the room playing when their mom died or they would said something in anger to an ill parent that they regretted and i could so clearly see that the painful things that happened to these kids were not their fault for the first time i was able to see that that was probably true for me too by blaming themselves the kids were making their losses make sense even though it hurt to blame themselves it gave them a reason for the terrible thing that happened like losing someone they love for no reason at all maybe some of you can related often when we feel difficult things we blame ourselves because it is easier than admitting we have no control that is what i had been doing for the 25 years since my dad died but just because you feel guilt and shame does not mean you did something wrong just because you feel regret does not necessarily mean you should have acted differently it sounds very simple and it is very hard to accept but life is nothing except one long sushi conveyor belt of things that are going to test you and teach you at the same time i know this because first i lost my dad but then we lost our family home to wildfire the house and everything in it burned including almost everything that my dad had worked so hard hard to do and leave for us after he died and yet in one small wooden shed that i do not know how this was spared by the fire behind a bunch of old farming equipment we found a couple five gallon plastic buckets of my dad's honey he would harvested it more than 30 years earlier and it was still perfect the ancient egyptians used honey as a sweetener and also as a natural antibiotics on one papyrus it was written that when the sun god cried his tears fell to earth and became bees that made honey for the people life from grief pain into sweetness sorrow into medicine two years after the fire i lost my mom also to cancer but quickly this time she chose right to die too which was legal now and because of the experience we would had with my dad we vowed that this time would be totally different no one would be left wondering if they messed up or if she knew how much she meant to them so we had a living memorial service for her and we each took turns telling her how much she meant to us and she said the same thing back it was so beautiful and it also really hurt i think if you can swing it everyone deserves the chance to say goodbye what i know now and what i wish i could tell my younger self is that you cannot have joy without pain you cannot have resilience without challenges happiness without sadness or bravery without fear these things are not opposites they are partners there is no such thing as happily ever after i am sorry there is only sadly happy and happily sad and that is enough it is more than enough honestly i like to think that before we enter this world we are asked to sign a kind of cosmic release form acknowledging the extreme risk it is to care deeply about anyone or anything or any place i imagine it goes something like this i hereby acknowledge that in exchange for the chance to live i must accept both pain and pleasure joy and sorrow often at the exact same time this is the ticket price for the chance that is to live it is never too late to sign it thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 3: {'text': \"i am here to help you do even more unzipping of your minds and of your hearts moxie clay came out here and challenged your expectations and i am going to ask you to unzip and let your expectations fall out and push them aside all together because they are holding you back expectations are those lists of things what are expectations we build up that tell us how things should be they keep us feeling safe and they also often prevent us from being fully present in our lives and from living to our highest potential so i am going to tell you about my journey away from expectation which also turned out to be a journey toward self empowerment and hope and then how it might apply to your relationships as well i first learned about the power of letting go of expectation on my journey back to my natural family my birth family i am adopted and my adoption is a fairly standard post world war two story in great brain my natural parents live next door to each other in a small town near the east coast of scotland and when they finished high school they went to the west of scotland to glasgow a whopping 38 miles away my father went to heathers story glasgow university my mother went to nursing school and when she became pregnant they decided they were going to get married but they were going to wait and tell their families when they went home on christian break so they expected to end that year by becoming a family that was remember 1966 what they got instead was a tearful break up outside my father's garage from my mother that was followed by a stay at a mothering home a daughter who left the hospital before she did a bill for my foster care and ultimately my adoption my father paid penance by working as a bricklayer for a year before he to university in edinburgh they never saw each other again whatever expectations they had were letting go of expectations shattered on top of that they were told that they should be grateful privileged that they had a chance to redeem themselves and move on this is all pretty standard stuff for that time in place and i am telling you this because i want to note that although my parents learned not to expect in the wake of our separation this is not the productive kind of letting go the kind of letting go that they learned is rooted in shame and in punishment there is not any hope in it it is about shutting down and what i would like us to do today is learn how to let go and open up so fast-forward 18 years from that tearful breakup in the garage my adoptive father my dad had made it clear that he would totally understand if i wanted to go and find my natural family this is a lot easier in scotland than it is here they do not alter birth certificates the adoptee has the rights to all the records so i took myself off to the house of records in edinburgh and got hold of my birth certificate it had my birth name my mother's name her then address it took me another 18 years to decide to search the lead up to that would take another tedtalk or two mostly something had shifted inside me on a trip back in 2003 i walked past the house listed on the birth certificate and i just could not let it go after that i was led entirely by my gut i kind of had to be adoptee are less than i of the population only a few of assert and only a fraction of the people who search actually wind up being in reunion there are not enough of us for there to be a guidebook and for me this turned out to be a good thing it did help that i had had my own child my first child in somewhat similar circumstances to my own birth it also helped that i knew two other friends who were adoptee who were in reunion they had gone into the reunion with a litany of expectations one friend was in a relationship with her natural father that could best be termed as clandestine the other friend's father drank himself into ice the first time they met their relationships with all their natural families were fraught to say the least so i went in with an awareness of the letting go of hope risks i looked clearly at the risks and i decided to go ahead i went in also trying to pare back to what i really hoped without the expectation and what i hoped was to find my natural mother i wanted to know where i came from yes part of me did want the opah style reunion you know the one where you go and the whole gigantic attractive successful natural family welcomes the adoptee on whom they have been waiting their whole lives but i did not go expecting it i pared back and back to what was driving the hope i knew i had to hang on to that i knew i had to be whole and i had to expect nothing when i felt ready to do that i contacted birth link in scotland this is a nonprofit agency that helps adoptee and their families connect with each other i put my name on the list for a searcher that takes some months so in the waiting time i searched more deeply within myself i asked myself all kinds of odd questions what would i do if i found my mother and she was dying and needed my help what would i make of it if i found her and she was alcoholic obese if she was destitute a retired prostitute and i realized that anything that would bother me deeply would do so because i already saw it as a weakness in myself in other words anything i might want her to change was really something i wanted to change in myself i believe this is also called owning your own stuff owning your own stuff also talk to my brother he is also adopted and he said look heather the only thing you really have to worry about is if you go to meet her and she comes to the door with her bags packed and goes alright darling we are we going cut she thinks she is moving in with you anything else you can just run away from start is often good for a little bit of comedy with some truth embedded and he was right either one of us could end the relationship at any moment and is not that the case with all our relationships we behave as though in our relationships especially our significant ones we behave as though we are operating with some kind of a relationship union like a pipe fitters union that is going to uphold our expectation contract but the truth is relationships live in a right-to-work state any party and sometimes a third party like sudden death can end the contract with no notice and no cause and that is a scary truth to face but as with any other no guidebook truth all the expectation in the world cannot stop it what i knew what my net natural parents and i had lived for nearly four decades before we came face-to-face is that expectation does not guarantee you a thing so i entered the relationship knowing the risks i entered the relationship owning what i brought i entered the relationship without that guidebook and here's the good thing about there not being a guidebook there are not any articles about what a good reunion looks like like the articles you read that imply that all the other married couples have more sex than you the skinny woman next door eats cherry pie for breakfast the other guy's business makes more money than yours and it is more fun to work there all the things that build up our expectations and they record chances of honoring what is right in front of us so when i entered the relationship in this rest in way what i found that i was able to really rest in and notice small moments and to take joy there i noticed for instance the grain of my mother's freckled hand wrapped around her mug of tea the first time we met i got to experience her with the surest sureness of adulthood and the heart of a child i did not have my expectation checklist running through my head that is what expectations do they tend to run through our head act like a third party in our relationship constantly vying for our attention and that feels okay when things match up but even then we have stepped away from the moment and the relationship to check in with them and when things do not measure up then we really go aside we start talking to expectation asking it for affirmation he should have brought me flowers should not he she should run those meetings on time and our expectation list says oh yes honey you are right get back in there and make them do it your way so you keep asking and asking and getting grumpier and grumpier when things do not measure up if you have asked a couple of times and you have not gotten the response you wanted you are probably not going to get it and in that stepping away to measure up with expectation you have missed the moment and the relationship as it unfolded that might have offered a path forward and even when the worst thing happens when your expectations are not met and another path forward is not on offer you are then resting in the truth and you can choose to move yourself forward from the truth of that relationship in that moment expectation does not stop painful stuff from happening it just blames it on somebody else what expectations do is pull us out of the moment they hold us in an infinite loop of false possibility so i challenge you today to free yourself from this loop of false possibility before you leave this building this afternoon think of one relationship that has one unfulfilled expectation in it let the expectation go search yourself own your stuff commit to entering your next interaction in that relationship without the expectation hanging on to some hope and then just allowing yourself to fully rest in the reality of the moment whatever needs or wants you might have it is possible that those can be met in some other way but not by this person at this moment settle your heart to that and then move yourself forward i think you will find that if you can be brave enough to rest in reality human and flawed and possibly beautiful reality it will take you places better than you have ever dared to expect\"}\n",

those alternative businesses generally i do not remember any that turned out well the truth is that these things one tries to do sometimes end in some failures some losses and some bad moments but i like to start this way because if not one always talks only about the good parts of the story and if there is something we have all experienced it is that we learn much more from failures and mistakes than from the things that go well the truth is that it has to do with everything as many of the previous speakers have said we should not be afraid of failures they are just another part of life another part of work well basically i want to share some small tools that have helped me both at work and in some parts of life as well we try to organize and generate some organizational tools which we will be discussing but above all i want to share that i had the opportunity or rather the intention because i had the opportunity but i had the intention to study at the university i graduated as an enologist at an agricultural college which functioned in this great building and when one leaves these traditional tools those that we all know like primary school secondary school university master's degrees languages we sometimes realize that they are not enough when we enter the labor field we see that all these tools are very good very positive but they are not enough so my idea is to share some tools that i found more practical and that can help us tools that can help us to develop a business a life many things that we will be discussing and that will help us as we said all these tools are very good but we see that they are not enough so to organize this i want to make a small analogy of work or life in general with a journey what does this have to do with well we all have to be clear about many things whether the journey is short or long it does not matter we have to know where we are starting from what tools we have for the journey and we need to have a goal where we want to got many things may seem obvious and some speakers have already mentioned them but you will see that these obvious things are not always put into practice when it is time to act for example we need to know where we are where we want to got and how we plan for it for instance how do we plan for monday, how do we start monday, do we have it programmed analyzed and know what we will do this extends into the week the months the years our personal goals our work goals so i insist a lot on making the first analysis knowing exactly our starting point from there obviously the tools we need for the journey will emerge the tools we need to develop ourselves while all these traditional tools are good suddenly we can find many other tools in life that will help us progress one of the main tools is observing observe what observe the people around you to copy what they are doing well to take what you like from them and improve it adapt it to yourself these are all small things that will make us better and make things simpler and better the truth is that if you look around you will find a lot of people from parents friends colleagues all of them have something positive absolutely always you can learn something from them so it is very important to be an observer not just to see but to observe to copy and take the positive aspects also it is important to realize that we cannot surround ourselves with just anyone it may seem obvious but the truth is it is crucial to get closer to people who bring something positive who help us grow who complement us and distance ourselves from those who are negative who do not help who do not contribute make a small analysis of the people around you and you will see that by thinking positively there are many things you can learn and that you have not even noticed yet another typical thing especially as one starts to develop and grow is losing priorities it is fundamental to set priorities we all know examples the typical one who starts to do well and the first thing they do is buy a better care instead of capitalizing on their work it is important to have clear priorities and not lose them as we progress as the situation improves we must capitalize on our achievements and not rush into things another important thing is setting rules we all know we live in a country with many rules or at least many illogical rules but no one forces us to be stuck in that situation we can set our personal rules for example as the owner of my company i never do what i want i do not do what is best for me i do what is best for everyone this is a way of setting rules in the personal sphere in the business sphere we have certifications for several years we have had is certifications for commercialization and they help us stay organized and maintain a work line in a country that sometimes does not help in this sense instead of lamenting we can generate our own rules talking about travel there are many young people here i had the opportunity to play rugby and i got the chance to play in australia for a years and in italy for two years traveling is not easy today but there are endless opportunities and it is worth trying traveling generates personal growth and life experience that you cannot learn elsewhere it is a great way to learn languages and cultures if you get the chance choose wisely direct your efforts to places where you can gain the most like learning a new language finally having clear goals and dreams is essential it is crucial to have a great dream that motivates you no matter how big or small being convinced and determined will give you the strength to reach your goals with determination you can achieve whatever you want that is all thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 5: {'text': \"when i was 27 years old i left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding teaching i went to teach seventh'-graders math in the new york city public schools and like any teacher i i did quizzes and tests i gave out homework assignments when the work came back i calculated grades what struck me was that i was not the only difference between my best and my worst students some of my strongest performers did not have stratosphere i scores some of my smartest kids were not doing so well and that got me thinking the kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math sure they are hard ratios decimals the area of a parallelogram but these concepts are not impossible and i was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough after several more years of teaching i came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective from a psychological school perspective in education the one thing we know how to measure best is i but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily so i left the classroom and i went to graduate school to become a psychologist i started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings and in every study today my question was who is successful here and why my research team and i went to west point military academy we tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out we went to the national spelling bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition we studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the of the school years and of those who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students we partnered with private companies asking which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs and who is going to earn the most money in in all those very different contexts one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success and it was not social intelligence it was not good looks physical health and it was not i it was grit grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals grit is having stamina grit is sticking with your future day in day out not just for the week not just for the months but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality grit is living life like it is a marathon not a sprint a few years ago i started started studying grit in the chico public schools i asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduated turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduated even when i match them on every characteristic i could measure things like family income standardized achievement test scores even how safe kids felt when they were at school so it is not just at west point or the national spelling bee that grit matters it is also in school especially for kids at risk for dropping out to me the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know how little science knows about building it every day parents and teachers ask me how do i build grit in kids what do i do to teach kids a solid work ethics how do i keep them motivated for the long run the honest answer is i do not know what i do know is that talent does not make you gritty our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments in fact in our data grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent so far the best idea i have heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset this is an it is an idea developed at standard university by carol deck and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change with your effort dry deck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge they are much more likely to persevere when they fail because they do not believe that failure is a permanent condition so growth mindset i said is a great idea for building grit but we need more and that is where i am going to end my remarks because that is where we are that is the work that stands before us we need to take our best ideas our strongest intuitions and we need to test them we need to measure whether we have been successful and we have to be willing to fail to be wrong to start over again with lessons learned in other words we need to be gritty about getting kids grittier thank you\"}\n"

      "Resultado 1: {'text': \"what keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life if you were going to invest now in your future best self where would you put your time and your energy there was a recent survey of millennial asking them what their most important life goals were and over 80 % said that a major life goal for them was to get rich and another 50 % of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous and we are constantly told to lean in to work to push harder and achieve more we are given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them those pictures are almost impossible to get most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but 2020. we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative but what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study many people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy we did that the hazard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that is ever been done for 75 years we have tracked the lives of 724 men year after years asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball further down the field but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived about 60 of our original 724 men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s. and we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men and i am the fourth director of the study since 1938, we have tracked the lives of two groups of men the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at hazard college they all finished college during world war i and then most went off to serve in the war and the second group that we have followed was a group of boys from button's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boson of the 1930s. most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed they were given medical exams we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top and some made that journey in the opposite direction the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today 75 years later telling you that the study still continues every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives many of the inner city boson men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just is not that interesting the hazard men never ask that question to get the clearest picture of these lives we do not just send them questionnaires we interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records from their doctors we draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said it is about time so what have we learned what are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we have generated on these lives well the lessons are not about wealth or fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get from this 75 year study is this good relationships keep us happier and healthier period we have learned three big lessons about relationships the first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier they are physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five america will report that they are lonely and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that it is not just the number of friends you have and it is not whether or not you are in a committed relationship but it is the quality of your close relationships that matters it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health high conflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective once we had followed our men all all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who was not and when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it was not their middle'-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old it was how satisfied they were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men and women reported in their is that on the days when they had more physical pain their moods stayed just as happy but the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain and the third big lesson that we learn about relationships on our health is that good relationships do not just protect our bodies they protect our brains it turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your is is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those people's memories stay sharper longer and the people in relationships where they feel they really cannot count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier memory decline and those good relationships they do not have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments did not take a toll on their memories so this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well'-being, this is wisdom that is as old as the hills why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore well we are human what we would really like is a quick fix something we can get that will make our lives good and keep them that way relationships are messy and they are complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends that is not sexy or glamorous it is also lifelong it never ends the people in our 75'-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates just like the millennial in that recent survey many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life but over and over over these 75 years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let us say you are 25 or you are 40 or you are 60. what might leaning into relationships even look like well the possibilities are practically endless it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member who you have not spoken to in years because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges i would like to close with a quote from mark twain more than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this there is not time so brief is life for bickering apologies heart burnings callings to account there is only time for loving but an instant so to speak for that the good life is built with good relationships thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 2: {'text': 'how exciting to be here what i am going to try and do today is add to the amazing lineup of speakers today by bringing the brain into our discussion of the creative spark and i want to do that by telling you about some of the newest research that i have been doing in my neuroscience research lab at new york university asking the question can aerobic exercise that is can going to the gym actually improve your learning memory and cognition i also want to address the question of whether increased aerobic exercise can also make you more creative now i remember the day that i realized i wanted to become a neuroscientist i was a freshman at up berkeley, and i was taking a freshman seminar class with just 10 or 15 of us called the brain and its potential taught by martian diamond she was standing at the front of the classroom and she had this beautiful hat box and with her gloved hands she opened that hat box and out she pulled a real live fixed human brain now it was the very first time i would seen a human brain and what she told us was that what she was holding in her hands was the most complex structure known to mankind it is the only structure that can think about itself and one of the most amazing things about the brain is that it can change as a function of the environment it can learn it can grow and i thought that was the coolest thing i would ever heard in my whole life and i did not know it that day but that idea of the brain and its potential and what is called neural plasticity - the ability to change as a function of the environment - was going to become my life\\'s work in science that is what i want to tell you about today so i started out studying a structure in the brain called the hippocampus it is really important for long-term memory but more recently i have become interested in how exercise can actually improve our learning memory and cognition and i got interested in that not because i read a paper or went to a talk i went to the gym when i turned 40, i decided i wanted to get in the best shape of my life and i went to the gym and the class that i found that kept me coming back to the gym on a really regular basis was a class called \"intensati,\" developed by this amazing fitness instructor named patrician more in new york city now intensity is unique because it takes physical movements from kickbox, dance yoga and martial arts but the unique part is that it pairs each physical movement with a positive spoken affirmation what do i mean by that so in intensati, we do not just punch we say i am strong now and the class says it back to you so what happens is that you not only get that great aerobic exercise but because you are speaking out you actually get an increase in aerobic output and it makes you feel great so the bottom line was i got in great shape but there were two amazing benefits that i noticed one was that i had this amazing motivation i felt like a million bucks after i came out of this class and i could not wait to go back and i thought my gosh patrician more is an amazing teacher to instill that kind of motivation and then i thought well wait a second i am a teacher i wonder if my students feel that way after my neuroanatomy class i am going to come back to that in a second the second amazing benefit was that when i went back to work - when i started doing intensity i was writing a lot of grants - and i noticed that as i got more regular with the workouts my writing got easier i was able to make associations better i was able to focus better and i thought this is amazing i want to look at the neuroscience literature to understand what is going on and i looked at the literature - a lot of new studies coming out as well as looking at some of the older studies that had led to our current understanding and when i looked at those i found a very familiar name that name was martian diamond so she was not only my undergraduate advisor but she was a real pioneer in neuroscience research and really only one of the only women working in this field back in the late 1950s and \\'60s, when she discovered that when you raise rats in what she called an enriched environment with lots of toys to play with other rats to play with and they run around a lot and you compared their brains to rats raised in what she called an impoverished environment with no toys just a couple of rats in a small box what you can do is measure their brain you measure actually the thickness of that outer covering of their brain called the cortex and what she found is that the rats raised in enriched environments had cortices that were actually thicker their brain grew as a function of this enriched environment and later studies showed that exercise the increased exercise those rats were getting because they were running around a lot more was a big factor in that brain change so i thought okay this is an area that i really want to get to know and as a professor the best way to get to know topic area is to teach a class so i decided i am going to teach a class at nu called can exercise change your brain and i decided because i got inspired to do this because of exercise i thought would not it be great if i could bring exercise into the classroom and not only teach students about what exercise is doing to their brain but also teach them have them experience what exercise felt like so i thought i could do this so i decided to go to the gym and of course i loved intensati, so i became a certified intensity instructor and a certified fitness instructor i could tell you oh it was so hard i was teaching classes i was writing grants but the truth is it was so much fun it was really fun because i got to learn a whole new way to move a whole new way to motivate students and i stayed in great shape so there was nothing better so i had this class i was teaching i was going to teach an hour of aerobic exercise i trained for six months to be able to teach in front of this class - i had never done this before but i thought it would be fun - so teach an hour of aerobic exercise an hour of intensati, followed by an hour-and-a-half lecture on the effects of exercise in the brain but then i realized i had my first study right there my students could be my subjects in my first study all i had to do was test them cognitively at the beginning at the end of the semester and compare their performance to a class that did not exercise and ask whether in fact exercise could improve their cognitive performance so that is exactly what i did and before i tell you what our prediction was and what our results were i just want to take you back for a moment to september i 2009, which was the first day of this can exercise change your brain class and it is seared in my memory mainly because i was really scared and nervous i give many many lectures i love giving lectures but this one i was very nervous why because my goal was to actually try and inspire these kids to love exercise in the way that patrician more inspired me but also inspire them to love neurobiology and the brain and plasticity the way that martian diamond inspired me so i had a pretty high bar and i was pretty scared to step out in front of that classroom but i have to say i think the students were a bit scared too they would never come to a class where the instructor came in workout clothes they would never sweated in front of their professor and i got a lot of nervous laughter when i told them they were going to have to say positive affirmations not not say yell positive affirmations in class but i have to say it was the most memorable first class i have ever taught the students really got into it okay there was nervous laughter and a lot of giggling but they really got into it they were shouting the affirmations they were really going all out in the workout and the best thing was that motivation and that inspiration oozed over into our academic our lecture part they remained engaged asked lots of questions it was a fantastic first class and a fantastic semester so what did we find so our prediction goes back to that structure that i said was important for long-term memory the hippocampus it goes back to the hippocampus because the hippocampus is one of only two brain structures where new brain cells new neurons are born so you and i have shiny new hippocampus cells being born in our hippocampus but the cool thing is that experimental studies in animals have shown that increased aerobic exercise can actually enhance the birth of those new hippocampus neurons and make them live even longer so our prediction was that this increase in aerobic exercise in my nu students would actually improve their learning and memory improve their ability to learn new pieces of information and improve their ability to retain those new pieces of information did we find that well we tested them on a whole battery of different cognitive tests and what we found was one significant improvement in my class that improvement was in the ability to encode new long-term memories what task was that it was a complicated task it was actually a quite difficult task students were given a really complex geometrical image - it was like an etch-a-sketch image - and then after a delay they would have to discriminate between that etch-a-sketch image and one that looked very very similar to it my students got significantly faster at identifying the correct image that they saw before so they are able to separate out things that are coming in your memory for example you are meeting lots of new people here today and so you might be better if you exercise and come to my class at differentiating between the faces of different people that you meet today so that is a very very useful thing to be able to do so is this new what is new about this well it is new and exciting because - i have to say we are not the only people my lab is not the only lab interested in the effects of exercise but the majority of the work has been done on looking at the effects of exercise in the elderly population why because cognitive decline is a major health issue in the elderly not to even mention alzheimer\\'s disease the exciting news in the elderly population is that increased aerobic exercise has clearly been shown to improve cognition so that is great but the idea there is that there is decline already so you have a little bit of room to see improvement what about my healthy young very smart nu neuroscience majors they are at the peak of their cognitive abilities as are you and i could exercise actually help us our studies suggest that yes they can now we are not only interested in learning memory and cognition but there is a really exciting link to the topic of today\\'s conference that is creativity and that comes from one of the newest directions of study of the hippocampus we have known for a very very long time that exercise can improve - sorry - that the hippocampus is important for long-term memory but recent studies have suggested the hippocampus is also important for creativity and imagination why because patients with hippocampus damage have significant impairments at being able to imagine new situations so we ask a patient with hippocampus damage describe for me a tropical beach scene - they have never been to a tropical beach they can barely say anything about sand or water whereas a control subject would be able to tell you about the white sand and the corona in their left hand with that an umbrella in it all these different details so the idea is the hippocampus is not only important for putting new associations in mind that help you remember the events like this in your past - it will be in your past - but also important for putting new concepts together in unique ways the basis of both creativity and imagination so what we want to do - we have not done this - is to look at the effects of exercise not only on learning and memory but on increased creativity as well so what is the bottom line here the bottom line is simple increased aerobic exercise can improve learning memory and possibly creativity what is more to know and everybody wants a magic pill to get smarter well this is not a pills and it comes with a lot more sweat than a pills but it can help you it is free it helps you every day and our goal over the next ten years is trying to figure out exactly how that is helping you what exactly is changing in the brain so i only have one question for you who wants to go to the gym anybody okay great thank you'}\n",

master's degrees languages we sometimes realize that they are not enough when we enter the labor field we see that all these tools are very good very positive but they are not enough so my idea is to share some tools that i found more practical and that can help us tools that can help us to develop a business a life many things that we will be discussing and that will help us as we said all these tools are very good but we see that they are not enough so to organize this i want to make a small analogy of work or life in general with a journey what does this have to do with well we all have to be clear about many things whether the journey is short or long it does not matter we have to know where we are starting from what tools we have for the journey and we need to have a goal where we want to got many things may seem obvious and some speakers have already mentioned them but you will see that these obvious things are not always put into practice when it is time to act for example we need to know where we are where we want to got and how we plan for it for instance how do we plan for monday, how do we start monday, do we have it programmed analyzed and know what we will do this extends into the week the months the years our personal goals our work goals so i insist a lot on making the first analysis knowing exactly our starting point from there obviously the tools we need for the journey will emerge the tools we need to develop ourselves while all these traditional tools are good suddenly we can find many other tools in life that will help us progress one of the main tools is observing observe what observe the people around you to copy what they are doing well to take what you like from them and improve it adapt it to yourself these are all small things that will make us better and make things simpler and better the truth is that if you look around you will find a lot of people from parents friends colleagues all of them have something positive absolutely always you can learn something from them so it is very important to be an observer not just to see but to observe to copy and take the positive aspects also it is important to realize that we cannot surround ourselves with just anyone it may seem obvious but the truth is it is crucial to get closer to people who bring something positive who help us grow who complement us and distance ourselves from those who are negative who do not help who do not contribute make a small analysis of the people around you and you will see that by thinking positively there are many things you can learn and that you have not even noticed yet another typical thing especially as one starts to develop and grow is losing priorities it is fundamental to set priorities we all know examples the typical one who starts to do well and the first thing they do is buy a better care instead of capitalizing on their work it is important to have clear priorities and not lose them as we progress as the situation improves we must capitalize on our achievements and not rush into things another important thing is setting rules we all know we live in a country with many rules or at least many illogical rules but no one forces us to be stuck in that situation we can set our personal rules for example as the owner of my company i never do what i want i do not do what is best for me i do what is best for everyone this is a way of setting rules in the personal sphere in the business sphere we have certifications for several years we have had is certifications for commercialization and they help us stay organized and maintain a work line in a country that sometimes does not help in this sense instead of lamenting we can generate our own rules talking about travel there are many young people here i had the opportunity to play rugby and i got the chance to play in australia for a years and in italy for two years traveling is not easy today but there are endless opportunities and it is worth trying traveling generates personal growth and life experience that you cannot learn elsewhere it is a great way to learn languages and cultures if you get the chance choose wisely direct your efforts to places where you can gain the most like learning a new language finally having clear goals and dreams is essential it is crucial to have a great dream that motivates you no matter how big or small being convinced and determined will give you the strength to reach your goals with determination you can achieve whatever you want that is all thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 4: {'text': \"early in my life i learned that there was one thing that could kill a festive mood at a dinner party and that was to talk about me to talk about my life my life as the daughter of a cult leader there was very little that was joking or lighthearted about the first 28 years of my life so i avoided that topic at all costs it was too painful nobody could understand so i became a master at diverting attention at during the conversation on to somebody else but not me i so rarely talked about my life that on the rare occasion when i would slip and somebody would kind of push for me to divulge i could not just casually and comfortably share it i would bond with the story and it would go something like this well i grew up outside of chico and my dad pastured actually a wonderful church there that through the years evolved into a 15,000 member cult it operated and it still operates under the guise of an independent fundamental baptist church but those who have left the followers have tried to leave outsiders even the media it was on 20/20 last year recognize that it is clearly a cult every member was in complete obedience father they did not dare disagree or be disloyal for fear of being publicly ridiculed or punished or banished for doing so they did not go on a vacation without asking my dad's permission and he had said they drink the kool-aid i am not kidding they would have my dad lived a double life one of righteous family man and dynamic speaker in the public eye but one of sordid sexual secrets privately secrets that only my siblings and me and my mom knew he hated my mom hated her treated her terribly abused her and even turned his own children against our mother we hated her he told us she was crazy we thought to make him happy we would hate her too our home was felt full of turmoil hatred stress strife and as a little girl it was isolating it was intense and it was frightening he had affairs had a mistress for many years the wife of a sunday-school teacher built her family a beautiful home right around the corner from our house you could see their family from our back door it was it was craziness living one way preaching another my brother my older brother he became another version of my father he took a he pastured a church in texts was found to have been having affairs with 14 different women divorced that current wife married one of the 14 my father tried desperately to cover it up moved into another church where he was found to have had 17 there was with different women and he just recreated what he had seen my dad with and my dad did nothing but cover it up i felt like i had one main responsibility as a child it was simple but daunting and that was to keep all the secrets there were so many you see he had taught us that the best way to please god was to please him because he was god's man and he taught us that to please him we had to keep all the secrets we could not even tell our best friends what went on in our home because we might be the causes for the destruction of his ministry i literally feared my very life if i ever talked about my dad's ministry but what went on in our home for fear that it would hurt his ministry i was so afraid and the greater the secrets the greater the fear and the greed of my determination to keep quiet i gotta tell you the money part of it was pretty nice as a kid i mean think about it tithes and offerings from 50,000 people know it created a lavish lifestyle for our family my father owned most of the city where the church was he owned to college to high schools to great schools a cemetery blocks of buildings he was very wealthy and even into our adult years he owned us he owned our homes our cars our furniture he owned our lives and we did not dare cross him because we were to her whose everything he died a multimillionaire he left nothing to his children he left everything to the organization which my younger sister and her husband now need and they still perpetuate his legacy the strict rules the undying loyalty and they still try to keep all the secrets i never understood why was i the only one that the four kids so tortured by the hypocrisy so disturbed by the mind control over thousands and thousands of people and so determined to find a better life why was i the only one that insisted on answers to my questions and why was i the only one that ultimately broke away and cut ties with the brainwashing the oppression the fear the secrets and the life that had never been my life i finally walked away when i was about 28 years of age then being estranged from my entire family and i did not see my family again until many years later at my dad's funeral okay see what i mean not a story to share at a dinner party i really got to the point after i left dinner that i could not talk about me for one thing who would understand for another thing it was too hard it hurt too bad so i made a mental note and permanent marker that said must never talk about my life and for many years i did not i could not however wonderful things had happened through the years since their therapy a lot of therapy deprogramming freedom from the mind control and i began to heal and learn and accept and forgive and even learn to be thankful that bizarre life that i had because i realized i was learning some amazing lessons from not only being there but from having the guts to leave and i now have values that are deeply carved in my very soul from that instead of these you do not get for reading a book or from a workshop or another person bellies that are only this deeply ingrained when you live what i live because my dad was a cult leader i now embrace three values and no one will ever take these away from me the first one is freedom to explore my own interests freedom to live within my own value system freedom to determine my own value system freedom to believe what i believe and never stifle what i believe freedom to disagree for you to ask questions and require honest answers freedom to learn who i am and freedom to love who i am the second value was truth i learned pretty quickly that i was not going to be very free until i dealt with what was true and that was hard for me truth was a scary word for me because i mean my entire life i had never been allowed to speak of what went on in our home i had never told even my best friends what went on in our house being truthful was one of the scariest things i could think of i learned that secrets grown in the dark but when exposed to the light of truth they start to lose their power many person my dear amazing therapist in callas texts who nurtured me and who loved me through years and years of healing she used to say to me kinda you are only as sick as your secrets you are only as sick as your secrets so i stopped keeping secrets and as scared as i was in my late is i finally began to deal with what was true i think it finally began to speak what was true and eventually learned how to live openly only in truth and the third value is courage did you know that you actually cannot have freedom or truth if you have no courage is a requirement for both you may desire to live in complete free and the complete truth but if you are lacking and courage you will live in neither one in my late is i had a tiny shred of courage not much but it was all i needed because my desire to live and be free and honest was somewhat great but that teeny shred of courage that i had was enough to allow me to walk away i have a plaque on my desk that i have had for years and it is gone with me everywhere i have ever moved it says the secret to happiness is freedom and the secrets of freedom is courage and that resonated with me i knew it was not going to be happy unless i was free but i knew i was not going to be free my second some courage to get out of there i had to cling to and act upon that tiny shred of courage in order to finally leave a cult the only friends i never know my childhood connections my history my family knowing that in doing so i finally have what i had longed for my entire life and that was freedom true freedom truth courage three words that maybe kind of trite and overused to some people to me they are the air that i breathe values upon which i insist on living and loving in my life oh and one other thing i actually know about you sharing my story talking about me i now recognize that it is in sharing my story and i can so passionately share with you my values gained over 28 years not an emotional prison that kept my heart under lock and key and kept my mind for knowing what i knew you know i sometimes wonder if perhaps living in the absence of our values is what can most clearly determine what indeed our values are and for me i really believe that the apes and the denial of created the presence of for so many years i was denied freedom truth and courage and now i will never let them go not to worry you are still not going to find me at a dinner party he is talking about my childhood not going to happen you will not find me sitting around elaborating over my father who took a wonderful church and turn it into a fifty thousand member cult i still know that is a mood killer i get it but you will find me here and in other appropriate settings especially if i can help somebody talking about my life with sincere gratitude for all that i have learned in spite of and because of living in the absence of freedom truth and courage and thank god i now have by now you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 5: {'text': \"you could say i had an unconventional childhood for a couple reasons i was born to jewfish avocado and citrus growers in rural southern californium my dad was a surgeon at our local hospital and my mom ran the ranch where we sold our fruit commercially and they rescued donkeys my early childhood was so beautiful strange and very privileged and you could say that i really had nothing to worry about until i did when i was three and my dad was 42, he was diagnosed with metastatic bone cancer and he was told he had six months to live he had his right leg amputated and he went in for chemo and radiation which in the early 1980s, for bone cancer was especially brutal and then miraculously he did not die first we got a years then we got two then we got five and then we got seven and then when i was eleven the cancer came back and stayed for good we lived between scans like that is how our time was meted out and we lived with the constant ticking clock of mortality we all have a clock like this it is just in my family we could hear ours all the time more often than not one of his scans turned up something back tumor here a neck tumor there his other knees and then he would go in for treatment and then he would come back to us it was a little bit like a sinister version of the giving tree only he was trading body parts for time with us and then as i mentioned when i was eleven really he found out this is what was going to kill him and quickly and that is when he decided that he was going to teach my brother and i all the skills we would need to know to survive without him and so while other kids were having play dates after school and riding their bikes my brother and i were in my dad's version of survival school and we were learning all kinds of things how to squish a man's eyeballs out if i was ever attacked all about the dewy decimal system i do not know why the role of nitrogen in soil health member nations of the united nations and so much more he was also doing a lot of things to be present for us after he died so things like becoming a beekeeper and putting away enough honey that he knew would not spoil so that we would have it for decades or planting trees around the ranch that would shade and feed us after he was gone or even though i was only twelve at this point he started a coop of doves and put my brother in charge so that he would let them go at my wedding someday throughout it all i knew he was suffering and often in terrible pain even though he really did not like to talk about it and he always used to say that when he could not enjoy life with me my brother and my mom he would die and i took this at face value until one afternoon when i was 16, i went into their medicine cabinet looking for something and i found an unmarked pill bottle with dosage instructions and i just knew it was a terminal prescription it was right to die medication before it was legal i was not made i immediately understood what he had been saying all those years and that he had a plan that there was a level of pain and suffering that he was not willing to experience and i did not say anything to anybody just put it back and left and then six months later we were on the phone and we got into a terrible fight it was so stupid it was about me not wanting to do my college applications and i was so angry and i hung up on him without saying goodbye and without saying i loved him i did not know it but he was about to take his medication and i think when it came down to it saying goodbye to me was just too impossible by the time i got home he was unconscious and i would never hear his voice again i dealt with his death by doubling down on the things he wanted for me i chased academic honors like a drug i played not one but two division one college sports i wrote a book i got my pod and then in my mid thirties i realized i was just completely exhausted i had been living my entire adult life in a way to prove to myself that i was good because someone who is good is not someone who hangs up on her dying dad i was using achievement and all of the shiny things that come along with it as a way of anesthetizing my own bad feelings of shame regret and fear those feelings were so big i worried that if i let myself feel them for even a minutes i would never ever feel anything else again but you cannot kill negative feelings sadly with work and avoidance and mine came back with a jolt on the outside i was successful and thriving and on the inside i was anxious terrified and questioning my worth by avoiding all of the negative feelings i was muting the fantastic ones too i was so scared about missing out and losing more of the best things in life joy awe love wonderland that i could not even let myself experience them i needed to find a new way to be i wanted to find a new way to be so i did a bunch of stuff i interviewed a ton of grief specialists and therapists and i even went out into the wilderness with no food and no tent to do the thing that scared me most which was to be alone with my own thoughts and feelings and absolutely nothing to distract me from them i learned i can go about five days without eating about a week without talking to anyone and forever without checking my phone but what hit me the hardest was becoming a volunteer at a grief support organization for kids so many of them thought they were bad too they would been out of the room playing when their mom died or they would said something in anger to an ill parent that they regretted and i could so clearly see that the painful things that happened to these kids were not their fault for the first time i was able to see that that was probably true for me too by blaming themselves the kids were making their losses make sense even though it hurt to blame themselves it gave them a reason for the terrible thing that happened like losing someone they love for no reason at all maybe some of you can related often when we feel difficult things we blame ourselves because it is easier than admitting we have no control that is what i had been doing for the 25 years since my dad died but just because you feel guilt and shame does not mean you did something wrong just because you feel regret does not necessarily mean you should have acted differently it sounds very simple and it is very hard to accept but life is nothing except one long sushi conveyor belt of things that are going to test you and teach you at the same time i know this because first i lost my dad but then we lost our family home to wildfire the house and everything in it burned including almost everything that my dad had worked so hard hard to do and leave for us after he died and yet in one small wooden shed that i do not know how this was spared by the fire behind a bunch of old farming equipment we found a couple five gallon plastic buckets of my dad's honey he would harvested it more than 30 years earlier and it was still perfect the ancient egyptians used honey as a sweetener and also as a natural antibiotics on one papyrus it was written that when the sun god cried his tears fell to earth and became bees that made honey for the people life from grief pain into sweetness sorrow into medicine two years after the fire i lost my mom also to cancer but quickly this time she chose right to die too which was legal now and because of the experience we would had with my dad we vowed that this time would be totally different no one would be left wondering if they messed up or if she knew how much she meant to them so we had a living memorial service for her and we each took turns telling her how much she meant to us and she said the same thing back it was so beautiful and it also really hurt i think if you can swing it everyone deserves the chance to say goodbye what i know now and what i wish i could tell my younger self is that you cannot have joy without pain you cannot have resilience without challenges happiness without sadness or bravery without fear these things are not opposites they are partners there is no such thing as happily ever after i am sorry there is only sadly happy and happily sad and that is enough it is more than enough honestly i like to think that before we enter this world we are asked to sign a kind of cosmic release form acknowledging the extreme risk it is to care deeply about anyone or anything or any place i imagine it goes something like this i hereby acknowledge that in exchange for the chance to live i must accept both pain and pleasure joy and sorrow often at the exact same time this is the ticket price for the chance that is to live it is never too late to sign it thank you\"}\n"

      "Resultado 1: {'text': \"what keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life if you were going to invest now in your future best self where would you put your time and your energy there was a recent survey of millennial asking them what their most important life goals were and over 80 % said that a major life goal for them was to get rich and another 50 % of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous and we are constantly told to lean in to work to push harder and achieve more we are given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them those pictures are almost impossible to get most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but 2020. we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative but what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study many people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy we did that the hazard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that is ever been done for 75 years we have tracked the lives of 724 men year after years asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball further down the field but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived about 60 of our original 724 men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s. and we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men and i am the fourth director of the study since 1938, we have tracked the lives of two groups of men the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at hazard college they all finished college during world war i and then most went off to serve in the war and the second group that we have followed was a group of boys from button's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boson of the 1930s. most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed they were given medical exams we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top and some made that journey in the opposite direction the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today 75 years later telling you that the study still continues every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives many of the inner city boson men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just is not that interesting the hazard men never ask that question to get the clearest picture of these lives we do not just send them questionnaires we interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records from their doctors we draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said it is about time so what have we learned what are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we have generated on these lives well the lessons are not about wealth or fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get from this 75 year study is this good relationships keep us happier and healthier period we have learned three big lessons about relationships the first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier they are physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five america will report that they are lonely and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that it is not just the number of friends you have and it is not whether or not you are in a committed relationship but it is the quality of your close relationships that matters it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health high conflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective once we had followed our men all all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who was not and when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it was not their middle'-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old it was how satisfied they were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men and women reported in their is that on the days when they had more physical pain their moods stayed just as happy but the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain and the third big lesson that we learn about relationships on our health is that good relationships do not just protect our bodies they protect our brains it turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your is is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those people's memories stay sharper longer and the people in relationships where they feel they really cannot count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier memory decline and those good relationships they do not have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments did not take a toll on their memories so this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well'-being, this is wisdom that is as old as the hills why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore well we are human what we would really like is a quick fix something we can get that will make our lives good and keep them that way relationships are messy and they are complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends that is not sexy or glamorous it is also lifelong it never ends the people in our 75'-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates just like the millennial in that recent survey many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life but over and over over these 75 years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let us say you are 25 or you are 40 or you are 60. what might leaning into relationships even look like well the possibilities are practically endless it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member who you have not spoken to in years because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges i would like to close with a quote from mark twain more than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this there is not time so brief is life for bickering apologies heart burnings callings to account there is only time for loving but an instant so to speak for that the good life is built with good relationships thank you\"}\n",

things should be they keep us feeling safe and they also often prevent us from being fully present in our lives and from living to our highest potential so i am going to tell you about my journey away from expectation which also turned out to be a journey toward self empowerment and hope and then how it might apply to your relationships as well i first learned about the power of letting go of expectation on my journey back to my natural family my birth family i am adopted and my adoption is a fairly standard post world war two story in great brain my natural parents live next door to each other in a small town near the east coast of scotland and when they finished high school they went to the west of scotland to glasgow a whopping 38 miles away my father went to heathers story glasgow university my mother went to nursing school and when she became pregnant they decided they were going to get married but they were going to wait and tell their families when they went home on christian break so they expected to end that year by becoming a family that was remember 1966 what they got instead was a tearful break up outside my father's garage from my mother that was followed by a stay at a mothering home a daughter who left the hospital before she did a bill for my foster care and ultimately my adoption my father paid penance by working as a bricklayer for a year before he to university in edinburgh they never saw each other again whatever expectations they had were letting go of expectations shattered on top of that they were told that they should be grateful privileged that they had a chance to redeem themselves and move on this is all pretty standard stuff for that time in place and i am telling you this because i want to note that although my parents learned not to expect in the wake of our separation this is not the productive kind of letting go the kind of letting go that they learned is rooted in shame and in punishment there is not any hope in it it is about shutting down and what i would like us to do today is learn how to let go and open up so fast-forward 18 years from that tearful breakup in the garage my adoptive father my dad had made it clear that he would totally understand if i wanted to go and find my natural family this is a lot easier in scotland than it is here they do not alter birth certificates the adoptee has the rights to all the records so i took myself off to the house of records in edinburgh and got hold of my birth certificate it had my birth name my mother's name her then address it took me another 18 years to decide to search the lead up to that would take another tedtalk or two mostly something had shifted inside me on a trip back in 2003 i walked past the house listed on the birth certificate and i just could not let it go after that i was led entirely by my gut i kind of had to be adoptee are less than i of the population only a few of assert and only a fraction of the people who search actually wind up being in reunion there are not enough of us for there to be a guidebook and for me this turned out to be a good thing it did help that i had had my own child my first child in somewhat similar circumstances to my own birth it also helped that i knew two other friends who were adoptee who were in reunion they had gone into the reunion with a litany of expectations one friend was in a relationship with her natural father that could best be termed as clandestine the other friend's father drank himself into ice the first time they met their relationships with all their natural families were fraught to say the least so i went in with an awareness of the letting go of hope risks i looked clearly at the risks and i decided to go ahead i went in also trying to pare back to what i really hoped without the expectation and what i hoped was to find my natural mother i wanted to know where i came from yes part of me did want the opah style reunion you know the one where you go and the whole gigantic attractive successful natural family welcomes the adoptee on whom they have been waiting their whole lives but i did not go expecting it i pared back and back to what was driving the hope i knew i had to hang on to that i knew i had to be whole and i had to expect nothing when i felt ready to do that i contacted birth link in scotland this is a nonprofit agency that helps adoptee and their families connect with each other i put my name on the list for a searcher that takes some months so in the waiting time i searched more deeply within myself i asked myself all kinds of odd questions what would i do if i found my mother and she was dying and needed my help what would i make of it if i found her and she was alcoholic obese if she was destitute a retired prostitute and i realized that anything that would bother me deeply would do so because i already saw it as a weakness in myself in other words anything i might want her to change was really something i wanted to change in myself i believe this is also called owning your own stuff owning your own stuff also talk to my brother he is also adopted and he said look heather the only thing you really have to worry about is if you go to meet her and she comes to the door with her bags packed and goes alright darling we are we going cut she thinks she is moving in with you anything else you can just run away from start is often good for a little bit of comedy with some truth embedded and he was right either one of us could end the relationship at any moment and is not that the case with all our relationships we behave as though in our relationships especially our significant ones we behave as though we are operating with some kind of a relationship union like a pipe fitters union that is going to uphold our expectation contract but the truth is relationships live in a right-to-work state any party and sometimes a third party like sudden death can end the contract with no notice and no cause and that is a scary truth to face but as with any other no guidebook truth all the expectation in the world cannot stop it what i knew what my net natural parents and i had lived for nearly four decades before we came face-to-face is that expectation does not guarantee you a thing so i entered the relationship knowing the risks i entered the relationship owning what i brought i entered the relationship without that guidebook and here's the good thing about there not being a guidebook there are not any articles about what a good reunion looks like like the articles you read that imply that all the other married couples have more sex than you the skinny woman next door eats cherry pie for breakfast the other guy's business makes more money than yours and it is more fun to work there all the things that build up our expectations and they record chances of honoring what is right in front of us so when i entered the relationship in this rest in way what i found that i was able to really rest in and notice small moments and to take joy there i noticed for instance the grain of my mother's freckled hand wrapped around her mug of tea the first time we met i got to experience her with the surest sureness of adulthood and the heart of a child i did not have my expectation checklist running through my head that is what expectations do they tend to run through our head act like a third party in our relationship constantly vying for our attention and that feels okay when things match up but even then we have stepped away from the moment and the relationship to check in with them and when things do not measure up then we really go aside we start talking to expectation asking it for affirmation he should have brought me flowers should not he she should run those meetings on time and our expectation list says oh yes honey you are right get back in there and make them do it your way so you keep asking and asking and getting grumpier and grumpier when things do not measure up if you have asked a couple of times and you have not gotten the response you wanted you are probably not going to get it and in that stepping away to measure up with expectation you have missed the moment and the relationship as it unfolded that might have offered a path forward and even when the worst thing happens when your expectations are not met and another path forward is not on offer you are then resting in the truth and you can choose to move yourself forward from the truth of that relationship in that moment expectation does not stop painful stuff from happening it just blames it on somebody else what expectations do is pull us out of the moment they hold us in an infinite loop of false possibility so i challenge you today to free yourself from this loop of false possibility before you leave this building this afternoon think of one relationship that has one unfulfilled expectation in it let the expectation go search yourself own your stuff commit to entering your next interaction in that relationship without the expectation hanging on to some hope and then just allowing yourself to fully rest in the reality of the moment whatever needs or wants you might have it is possible that those can be met in some other way but not by this person at this moment settle your heart to that and then move yourself forward i think you will find that if you can be brave enough to rest in reality human and flawed and possibly beautiful reality it will take you places better than you have ever dared to expect\"}\n",
      "Resultado 3: {'text': \"i have a problem how many times do we say that and we tend to think that it is because we have problems that we struggle in life it is not true if we struggle in life it is because we have parts within ourselves parts who are suffering parts who are afraid and most importantly who believe nothing can be changed this is the reason why we struggle up until a few months ago i thought i had a problem which was that i found it hard to speak about me in public on a personal level but i did oka because as a doctor most often it was related to medical or scientific topics and as a results there was no discomfort until the day i received a call from someone who means a great deal to me and who invited me to talk about my experience on the use of the psychotherapy model which i am introducing to you tonight and that i use at my hospital but he did ask specifically for me to make it personal since it was my experience and i quickly declined his invitation because there was a little voice inside my head telling me you have nothing of interest to say well i thought i was at peace with that but then few weeks or months later that same person calls me up again and again asks for me to present at that time i thought there most certainly was something to unravel here because if this person who means a lot to me asks again for me to come and talk about my experience there is something unfinished about this at first i asked him to give me a little time told him that i needed to think it through and i used this time to look inwards to look inwards to know who was telling me that i had nothing interesting to say to other people on a personal level to do so it is important to take a moment here is how i did it i focused inwards on this voice calmly and in a curious manner who is it at first all i heard was this message you have nothing of interest to say and then as i kept asking i heard something else if this person really knew you he would not ask you to do that he really has no idea who you are you have nothing interesting to say it went on for a while after a while i realized that this voice came from a person a part of me and that this person had all the traits of a critics a judge from within this was an important discovery because i could really become aware of the presence of this person and as a results i could genuinely talk with him ask him questions such as why do you keep on telling me all this why do you have this purpose in my life to criticize me to judge me the way you do what are you afraid of if i did accept the invitation and went to the conference to talk about myself it was really interesting because all of a sudden the tone changed and instead of criticism came something quite moving deep inside i am afraid that you may relive something hard you have experienced before so first i thanked this part for his caring intention and i then asked it know would you agree to step aside and to let me reconnect with this hardship you want to prevent me from reliving he agreed to that and behind this part of me was another part a little boy eight years of age he was standing by the door of the apartment i used to live in at the time he was standing absolutely frozen and he did not know i was there because for all these years the critic was standing between the two of us and so it took a little time for this little boy to realize that i was there and that i was there for him and so we started talking open heatedly i asked him if he would want to tell me about himself his story why he was frozen we took a moment and talked about his suffering his emotions once he turned to me and recognized me and trusted me enough he started explaining to me telling me things things i already knew but he said them again from deep inside his heart told me that he was the youngest of a family who was going through a hard time then with many agencies to deal with and that whenever this little boy wanted to talk about himself there was no room no time for that as a consequences he ended up thinking that what he thought was important to say in his heart was of no interest since nobody cared or so it seemed to him this was an important time because from this moment on he felt completely understood and so i asked him now that he knew i understood him whether he would leave the past behind and be interested to join me in the present whether he was interested in changing his way of life clearly he was and so i told him for this to happen there is something important for you to do it is to get rid of everything linked to this hardship and that still weighs on you he agreed to do so to relieve himself of his burden and to my great surprise i met a bold adventurous little boy very eager to join me and go to this conference once this change had taken place i turned to the critic and asked so how are things for you now do you still need to play this role in my life and once again to my surprise he said no i do not need to anymore i see that you can take care of this boy he is safe now i then asked would you accept to play another part to do something else less difficult less burdening he said woke i will be your adviser now i will assist you so the little boy the adviser and myself got to work we prepared the conference and people quite liked it why did i choose to tell you this story here tonight after all it is a story pertaining to familiar elements being hurt being defensive and maybe one would frown upon such a happy ending still there are key points i want to share with you linked to my own experience both with this little boy but also with the therapy model i came here to tell you about first the importance to meet the parts within ourselves how important this relationship is second why is it stuck inside as a result of what and that not dealing with it will prevent any change thirdly it can change there is a plan be what i did when i looked within was that i connected with it i could have talked to somebody about my problem i even could have mentioned my parts to them but instead i went within myself francs within franchise and connected with these parts first the critics then the boy and this is essential because when a connection is created from within myself changes occur a feeling of security and trust emerges and this allows for an important thing to happen which is for this critic to show himself beyond what he tells me who he truly is his underlying positive intention towards me he wanted to protect me it allows him to take a risk the second thing was why was it all stuck inside why was the boy stuck in the apartment the answer is quite simple it is because of his burden what is his burden it is the suffering which is attached to the hardship and this suffering is still there it was in or on the little boy the little boy was stuck there thinking he was not interesting the problem with the burden and the parts of us bearing it is that these parts absorb it all these parts believe they are the burden itself they forgot that they are merely bearing it they believe they are it and as a results this burden becomes a poison a genuine poison bums in our societies we like them so long as they are far enough from us they are dirty they stink they drink they yell they are unclean and so we tend to stay away from these members of society the same thing happens within ourselves there are parts of ourselves who are not attractive who stink who have experienced such hardships that have come to be unworthy of love because they are not pretty inside and so within ourselves we do the same thing we do with bums we shield ourselves from them and isolate them inside how do we do that well it is quite simple actually there are other parts in us who are quite good at this and create a protective barrier they are called protectors so who are the protectors well they are these parts in us which are linked to our habits our reassuring ways of dealing with things for example taking a little pill before going to bed because it is a little too hard without it or to have a couple of glasses because there is a difficult meeting ahead and we want to be relaxed or this overwhelming urge to succeed in life or to rely on your intellect to understand everything or to do sports because one has to release one's energy somehow and calm one's anxiety all these behaviors which are a little bit over the top which make us feel like we do not really have a choice in the matter these are the protectors within us there are parts within us doing all this and fortunately so because they help us cope with our pain they help prevent us from feeling down and when we feel down because we are in contact with these wounded parts they help us getting away from them because it is just too painful to stay there the problem is that these parts are scared because they know that if they stop what they are doing the fire of pain will rise again in our lives and so this fear prevents them from stopping why well since the wounded parts are convinced that they are their own burden that they are dirty the protective parts have no choice but to protect them and behave in our lives sometimes to extremes even to the point of being destructive either for us or for others this is the first tragedy the second tragedy is that we end up thinking the same thing they do that change is not an option that we are stuck with this forever and that is why it is important to know that there is a plan be plan b is the plan you use whenever what you tried first did not succeed plan a is i am hurt i protect myself plan b is something else it is doing what i did it is going within myself francs within franchise meeting these parts it is important because first it allows for the understanding of the intention the history the pain but mostly it brings security it allows for my protectors your protectors to stand aside enough so that i in a loving way can access these wounded parts and when these parts feel the compassion and love they agree to do what my little boy did which is to release their burden and to come back to their real nature and from then on our protective parts can consider stopping what they do what they are exhausted doing and causes us problems in life this person this francs within francs who could do all this is like a flame inside it is who i really am deep inside of me in the ifs psychotherapy model i am introducing to you tonight the internal family systems model this flame is called the self and i would like to leave you with a message that we share the adviser the little boy and myself this message is that this self is always here no matter what happened to us even the worst situations even in the most chronic situations this flame is always here available as an invitation to our protectors to trust and an invitation to these suffering parts to relieve themselves from their pain an invitation to our parts to relieve themselves from what weighs on them and come back to their true nature thank you\"}\n",

      "Resultado 1: {'text': 'how exciting to be here what i am going to try and do today is add to the amazing lineup of speakers today by bringing the brain into our discussion of the creative spark and i want to do that by telling you about some of the newest research that i have been doing in my neuroscience research lab at new york university asking the question can aerobic exercise that is can going to the gym actually improve your learning memory and cognition i also want to address the question of whether increased aerobic exercise can also make you more creative now i remember the day that i realized i wanted to become a neuroscientist i was a freshman at up berkeley, and i was taking a freshman seminar class with just 10 or 15 of us called the brain and its potential taught by martian diamond she was standing at the front of the classroom and she had this beautiful hat box and with her gloved hands she opened that hat box and out she pulled a real live fixed human brain now it was the very first time i would seen a human brain and what she told us was that what she was holding in her hands was the most complex structure known to mankind it is the only structure that can think about itself and one of the most amazing things about the brain is that it can change as a function of the environment it can learn it can grow and i thought that was the coolest thing i would ever heard in my whole life and i did not know it that day but that idea of the brain and its potential and what is called neural plasticity - the ability to change as a function of the environment - was going to become my life\\'s work in science that is what i want to tell you about today so i started out studying a structure in the brain called the hippocampus it is really important for long-term memory but more recently i have become interested in how exercise can actually improve our learning memory and cognition and i got interested in that not because i read a paper or went to a talk i went to the gym when i turned 40, i decided i wanted to get in the best shape of my life and i went to the gym and the class that i found that kept me coming back to the gym on a really regular basis was a class called \"intensati,\" developed by this amazing fitness instructor named patrician more in new york city now intensity is unique because it takes physical movements from kickbox, dance yoga and martial arts but the unique part is that it pairs each physical movement with a positive spoken affirmation what do i mean by that so in intensati, we do not just punch we say i am strong now and the class says it back to you so what happens is that you not only get that great aerobic exercise but because you are speaking out you actually get an increase in aerobic output and it makes you feel great so the bottom line was i got in great shape but there were two amazing benefits that i noticed one was that i had this amazing motivation i felt like a million bucks after i came out of this class and i could not wait to go back and i thought my gosh patrician more is an amazing teacher to instill that kind of motivation and then i thought well wait a second i am a teacher i wonder if my students feel that way after my neuroanatomy class i am going to come back to that in a second the second amazing benefit was that when i went back to work - when i started doing intensity i was writing a lot of grants - and i noticed that as i got more regular with the workouts my writing got easier i was able to make associations better i was able to focus better and i thought this is amazing i want to look at the neuroscience literature to understand what is going on and i looked at the literature - a lot of new studies coming out as well as looking at some of the older studies that had led to our current understanding and when i looked at those i found a very familiar name that name was martian diamond so she was not only my undergraduate advisor but she was a real pioneer in neuroscience research and really only one of the only women working in this field back in the late 1950s and \\'60s, when she discovered that when you raise rats in what she called an enriched environment with lots of toys to play with other rats to play with and they run around a lot and you compared their brains to rats raised in what she called an impoverished environment with no toys just a couple of rats in a small box what you can do is measure their brain you measure actually the thickness of that outer covering of their brain called the cortex and what she found is that the rats raised in enriched environments had cortices that were actually thicker their brain grew as a function of this enriched environment and later studies showed that exercise the increased exercise those rats were getting because they were running around a lot more was a big factor in that brain change so i thought okay this is an area that i really want to get to know and as a professor the best way to get to know topic area is to teach a class so i decided i am going to teach a class at nu called can exercise change your brain and i decided because i got inspired to do this because of exercise i thought would not it be great if i could bring exercise into the classroom and not only teach students about what exercise is doing to their brain but also teach them have them experience what exercise felt like so i thought i could do this so i decided to go to the gym and of course i loved intensati, so i became a certified intensity instructor and a certified fitness instructor i could tell you oh it was so hard i was teaching classes i was writing grants but the truth is it was so much fun it was really fun because i got to learn a whole new way to move a whole new way to motivate students and i stayed in great shape so there was nothing better so i had this class i was teaching i was going to teach an hour of aerobic exercise i trained for six months to be able to teach in front of this class - i had never done this before but i thought it would be fun - so teach an hour of aerobic exercise an hour of intensati, followed by an hour-and-a-half lecture on the effects of exercise in the brain but then i realized i had my first study right there my students could be my subjects in my first study all i had to do was test them cognitively at the beginning at the end of the semester and compare their performance to a class that did not exercise and ask whether in fact exercise could improve their cognitive performance so that is exactly what i did and before i tell you what our prediction was and what our results were i just want to take you back for a moment to september i 2009, which was the first day of this can exercise change your brain class and it is seared in my memory mainly because i was really scared and nervous i give many many lectures i love giving lectures but this one i was very nervous why because my goal was to actually try and inspire these kids to love exercise in the way that patrician more inspired me but also inspire them to love neurobiology and the brain and plasticity the way that martian diamond inspired me so i had a pretty high bar and i was pretty scared to step out in front of that classroom but i have to say i think the students were a bit scared too they would never come to a class where the instructor came in workout clothes they would never sweated in front of their professor and i got a lot of nervous laughter when i told them they were going to have to say positive affirmations not not say yell positive affirmations in class but i have to say it was the most memorable first class i have ever taught the students really got into it okay there was nervous laughter and a lot of giggling but they really got into it they were shouting the affirmations they were really going all out in the workout and the best thing was that motivation and that inspiration oozed over into our academic our lecture part they remained engaged asked lots of questions it was a fantastic first class and a fantastic semester so what did we find so our prediction goes back to that structure that i said was important for long-term memory the hippocampus it goes back to the hippocampus because the hippocampus is one of only two brain structures where new brain cells new neurons are born so you and i have shiny new hippocampus cells being born in our hippocampus but the cool thing is that experimental studies in animals have shown that increased aerobic exercise can actually enhance the birth of those new hippocampus neurons and make them live even longer so our prediction was that this increase in aerobic exercise in my nu students would actually improve their learning and memory improve their ability to learn new pieces of information and improve their ability to retain those new pieces of information did we find that well we tested them on a whole battery of different cognitive tests and what we found was one significant improvement in my class that improvement was in the ability to encode new long-term memories what task was that it was a complicated task it was actually a quite difficult task students were given a really complex geometrical image - it was like an etch-a-sketch image - and then after a delay they would have to discriminate between that etch-a-sketch image and one that looked very very similar to it my students got significantly faster at identifying the correct image that they saw before so they are able to separate out things that are coming in your memory for example you are meeting lots of new people here today and so you might be better if you exercise and come to my class at differentiating between the faces of different people that you meet today so that is a very very useful thing to be able to do so is this new what is new about this well it is new and exciting because - i have to say we are not the only people my lab is not the only lab interested in the effects of exercise but the majority of the work has been done on looking at the effects of exercise in the elderly population why because cognitive decline is a major health issue in the elderly not to even mention alzheimer\\'s disease the exciting news in the elderly population is that increased aerobic exercise has clearly been shown to improve cognition so that is great but the idea there is that there is decline already so you have a little bit of room to see improvement what about my healthy young very smart nu neuroscience majors they are at the peak of their cognitive abilities as are you and i could exercise actually help us our studies suggest that yes they can now we are not only interested in learning memory and cognition but there is a really exciting link to the topic of today\\'s conference that is creativity and that comes from one of the newest directions of study of the hippocampus we have known for a very very long time that exercise can improve - sorry - that the hippocampus is important for long-term memory but recent studies have suggested the hippocampus is also important for creativity and imagination why because patients with hippocampus damage have significant impairments at being able to imagine new situations so we ask a patient with hippocampus damage describe for me a tropical beach scene - they have never been to a tropical beach they can barely say anything about sand or water whereas a control subject would be able to tell you about the white sand and the corona in their left hand with that an umbrella in it all these different details so the idea is the hippocampus is not only important for putting new associations in mind that help you remember the events like this in your past - it will be in your past - but also important for putting new concepts together in unique ways the basis of both creativity and imagination so what we want to do - we have not done this - is to look at the effects of exercise not only on learning and memory but on increased creativity as well so what is the bottom line here the bottom line is simple increased aerobic exercise can improve learning memory and possibly creativity what is more to know and everybody wants a magic pill to get smarter well this is not a pills and it comes with a lot more sweat than a pills but it can help you it is free it helps you every day and our goal over the next ten years is trying to figure out exactly how that is helping you what exactly is changing in the brain so i only have one question for you who wants to go to the gym anybody okay great thank you'}\n",
      "Resultado 2: {'text': \"what keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life if you were going to invest now in your future best self where would you put your time and your energy there was a recent survey of millennial asking them what their most important life goals were and over 80 % said that a major life goal for them was to get rich and another 50 % of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous and we are constantly told to lean in to work to push harder and achieve more we are given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them those pictures are almost impossible to get most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but 2020. we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative but what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study many people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy we did that the hazard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that is ever been done for 75 years we have tracked the lives of 724 men year after years asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball further down the field but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived about 60 of our original 724 men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s. and we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men and i am the fourth director of the study since 1938, we have tracked the lives of two groups of men the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at hazard college they all finished college during world war i and then most went off to serve in the war and the second group that we have followed was a group of boys from button's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boson of the 1930s. most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed they were given medical exams we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top and some made that journey in the opposite direction the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today 75 years later telling you that the study still continues every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives many of the inner city boson men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just is not that interesting the hazard men never ask that question to get the clearest picture of these lives we do not just send them questionnaires we interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records from their doctors we draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said it is about time so what have we learned what are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we have generated on these lives well the lessons are not about wealth or fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get from this 75 year study is this good relationships keep us happier and healthier period we have learned three big lessons about relationships the first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier they are physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five america will report that they are lonely and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that it is not just the number of friends you have and it is not whether or not you are in a committed relationship but it is the quality of your close relationships that matters it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health high conflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective once we had followed our men all all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who was not and when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it was not their middle'-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old it was how satisfied they were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men and women reported in their is that on the days when they had more physical pain their moods stayed just as happy but the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain and the third big lesson that we learn about relationships on our health is that good relationships do not just protect our bodies they protect our brains it turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your is is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those people's memories stay sharper longer and the people in relationships where they feel they really cannot count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier memory decline and those good relationships they do not have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments did not take a toll on their memories so this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well'-being, this is wisdom that is as old as the hills why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore well we are human what we would really like is a quick fix something we can get that will make our lives good and keep them that way relationships are messy and they are complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends that is not sexy or glamorous it is also lifelong it never ends the people in our 75'-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates just like the millennial in that recent survey many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life but over and over over these 75 years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let us say you are 25 or you are 40 or you are 60. what might leaning into relationships even look like well the possibilities are practically endless it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member who you have not spoken to in years because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges i would like to close with a quote from mark twain more than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this there is not time so brief is life for bickering apologies heart burnings callings to account there is only time for loving but an instant so to speak for that the good life is built with good relationships thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 3: {'text': \"good morning let me tell you i am extremely excited to be here this morning i get the opportunity to stand before all of you and to tell you about the inspiration in my life organ and to tell you how she has played such a major role in my life in the lives of so many people who have special needs now before i get into all the details of that i want to back up a little bit and tell you how i got to this point as was mentioned i was in the home building business land development business started when i was 19 and really loved the business and had an opportunity for 21 years to really get the business to run exactly like i wanted it to i had an opportunity to get into the mortgage business title business all sorts of different businesses and then 2005 came and a company out of californium said we will not put you in retirement and if you remember back then business was really booming things were wild and crazy and the economy and so i said okay so i sold the companies and then i went from the day of running numerous companies to the point of then going okay what am i going to do in the second half of my life so many opportunities came to me i had an opportunity to get into different businesses reinvest in big ways and do some neat stuff but i also had the opportunity to take my daughter to school something i never had a chance to do i was able to go to organ's birthday parties and get to know her friends and talk to them and talk to parents he said let me tell you a little bit about organ organ just turned 18 years old but organ has special needs organ has a tough time adding two plus two she can get there but you got to work at it with her organ has a tough time reading a simple sentence she will get there but it is tough and she will get frustrated she will get upset at herself and wish she was someone else organ is someone who has 26 screws in her back and two rods and two hangers to allow her to stand up straight let me tell you what organ has it is more important than anything she has an attitude that is absolutely incredible every night when we put her to bed she has a smile on her face every morning she has a smile on her face she has gone through all these different obstacles and things but always keeps an attitude that is incredibly strong and so through that inspiration and the opportunity to talk and see more and understand more about the special needs community instead of all the opportunities that may exist from a business perspective i decided maybe the second half of my life she would be dedicated towards something else and that was all because of the inspiration and the attitude of this wonderful young lady now what does that mean well what i thought i had should do is build a foundation or form a foundation which i did and we do numerous things but one of the things that we wanted to do is we wanted to go out and build something or things as we were building the foundation that would be here for a long term would that be building medical facilities or different things in the community such as schools et that would be here long lasting to help the special needs community but then something happened about five years ago that really caused what i am here to talk about today and that is organ's wonderland you see we were on a family trip and organ loves to go swimming she does not really know how to swim like a and she is not real good at it but she loves to flap around in the water and do what kids do we went down to the pool at the hotel and it was late and day it was a smaller hotel a smaller pool and there were three kids at the other end of the pool and there were two of them were throwing a ball back and forth and organ and i were to pull i got out and organ i saw was slowly inching her way over and she wanted to play with those kids she could not tell him that she did not know how to really bring about that interaction so what happened is is organ started moving closer and closer she eventually hit the ball she got that close and the kids were looking at her like what are you doing organ just wanted to play what happened at that point is where this all happened those nice kids grabbed the ball and they all got out of the pool they got out of the pool because they did not know what it would be like to really explore the habit of the joy and the happiness of playing was someone who maybe could not verbally say exactly what she wanted but she would just like them in so many ways but because they did not understand that the interaction of play did not occur as organ turned around i saw her face and i thought to myself oh my god she just looked at me like i do not get it she did not say anything she went back i jumped in the pool we played i sat there and we did we continued on for a couple weeks i after that vacation i kept thinking about that turner organ's head to me and the look that she had and i have to tell you kept thinking about it thinking about it i said there is got to be a place that i can we can take organ to where everybody understands what is going on there in the element of play and there will be interaction between those who have special needs and those who do not have special needs i did not know what that meant so i thought well i will call some people i will go around look at different parks in the country just to see if there is something outside that we could replicate or take organ to or do something so somehow bring that barrier down to where the next time there are kids in that pool they will go hey come on over they will understand and that play will occur so i went around the country looking at a different place is that at least we are told that may be in line and nothing was closed what i found if anything had anything to tie with special needs that a lot of times it was off the beaten path it was not in the middle of everything else it was all kind of by itself and i said to myself let us do one of these in san anionic what is this i do not know what i am going to do i am just going to do it so i invited a bunch of people to a meeting to talk about the idea of building this part but and i just had a sheet of paper behind me that was basically white and i said i got this idea tell you what happened and we can do better nine invited doctors and therapists and teachers and people who have special needs and we all spent hours and hours and hundreds of people showed up i thought this is kind of cool because we do not really know what we are even gonna be talking about doll and they all showed up and we went over and we went over and over and talked about if we built this park with the theory of and the idea of trying to bring down that barrier what would be in it well what i heard was numerous things eight and a half pages of single tight ideas then i said okay what i want to do is i want to get outside the box i want to hire people to do this who have never done a part before i want to hire an architect who is never done a part before i wanted to hire an engineer who is never done a part before i want to hire graphics people have never done a part before because i am gonna be told by them how you are supposed to build a park and we are gonna be different this time so all these people who in did everything from organ's wonderland had never done it before that was the cool part what they had those some real grassroots ideas presented by people in the middle of it all the people who really work with special needs individuals on a daily basis and understand it and those who has special needs themselves what i heard more than anything was give us a place that is safe you see if i have a child who is autistic to go to the park is tough because you never know when that child might take a run would not we need to go to a park and know that somehow if that child did run that you could kind of relax for a little bit so when you go to organ's wonderland everybody gets an rid tag so we know exactly where they are at all times in the parking you can find them through any of the video screens that exist throughout the park the reason that exists is so that you can sit in if johnny runs off it is okay you can go find them you know exactly where he is and you will know everybody in your party within three seconds we brought that kind of technology and we also said not only do we want a safe place but we want a good environment we want an environment that is a little different does that mean well think about it if you are in a wheelchair and you go to these wonderful places do great job from an 88 perspective gives new world in all these places but the crowds and the time it might take to do something and impatience of people because they are not sometimes old at organ's women let us build a place that maybe could hold 4,500 or 5,000 people but let us not ever have more than about 1,500 or 2,000 in there this build it bigger so that the environment is one to where if you want to get on to a carousel and it takes longer because our carousel allows no matter what your physical or mental special need may be that we will allow you an opportunity to get on that carousel and if it takes ten minutes see if the culture of organ's wonderland it is okay we will help you and get you on that carousel and everybody is patient because that is what organ's wonderland is about there is no other carousel like the one at organ's wonderland there is no other offload adventure ride like the one at organ's wonderland there is no other train like the one that is at organ's wonderland these are not big magical ideas what we did basically at organ's wonderland i am so proud of the people who had never done this before but they said this look we are going to design a park for special needs but we are going to build it for everyone because when you walk into organ's wonderland it looks like any other park you do not see ramps and all that kind of stuff it is a place where you walk in and go i can play here know whether i have a special need or not but those who do have special needs they can do everything we take the most fragile children and adults those who are on ventilators those who sometimes unfortunately just have three days to live who say then the family says can they come over there and have an opportunity we had a child come to organ's wonderland that was three days before he died he had an opportunity he smiled he had that because he was able to do what he wanted to do and the family knew what he wanted to do and he could not have done it anywhere else in the world except that this unique part now as i talked earlier when i got to know organ's friends and families and stuff what i found out his morning was really one of the lucky ones you see organ has what she needs she has a physical therapist and the doctors and the and all that because i have been blessed to be able to give that to her but see i noticed that many times those with special needs do not have always all those economic opportunities to give their child are those who they care for what they really need so we made it early on and commitment that anyone who comes to organ's wonderland always comes for free always comes for free it does not matter we do not look it up in a book and define what special needs is if you say you have a special needs when you especially need when you come to the front you get in for free we figure if you lie about it you have a special need and so it is it is it is it is our approach saying we are here because we are gonna give you a break and we are gonna allow it the opportunity that if you want to come to this park thirty times a year you come to the park 30 times a year and you can ride to train seven times if you want to and we have some children who just stay on the train the whole time that is what they want that is that consistency is what they like at another place could they do that no no now through this entire process it is been amazing to see what has occurred i have to tell you a story about organ it kind of gives you a sense of what a place like this does i know what people he is asked me what does organ like to do when she goes to the park well at first all she would do is go on the swings we have 35 swings five different kinds whether you are in a wheelchair whatever your physical or mental special need maybe you can swing at organ's cornball organ we just go on the swings i see organ let us go on the carousel no shooing too close to it just scared of it all right let us go no let us go stand next to the carousel okay finally she did that then organ after a while eventually said i said organ let us just go and sit on an animal no okay finally she did that then we got her on an elephant could not can go just will sit on and then organ and then getting her off the elevator was in up thumb will go under but then the next time we went organ said we wanted to go to the carousel and when she went to the carousel now she would get on it and she would go one time real slow remember everybody else is in the park and enjoying the park with her at this point no pressure there is no pressure it is just simply but here's the neat thing organ now when she goes to the park goes to the carousel first and rides it on her own okay well why is that a big deal well organ now when she finishes the first time she looked at me said are you proud of me dad yeah and that is what happens at organ's wonderland you take a child who it seems like a small thing to write on a care so that is a big deal little things are big things and at organ's wonderland through play they learn they learn that they have the opportunity to achieve something just as even if it is a small thing just riding a carousel organ does not want me near the carousel when she rides now because she does not independently and it is taught her something and on the 26 different attractions that fit in this thirty-five million dollar park ultra accessible park it gives opportunities to thousands tens of thousands and i am happy to say over two hundred thousand people in such a short period have already been through the park not just from here matter of fact one out of two people who come to spark going come from this area they come from outside here they come from outside this the state they come from outside this country thirty four different countries have been represented at organ's wonderland already and here's the neat thing we do not have a marketing budget it is all done by word of mouth because those who have special needs and those who are caregivers and those who are involved in this whole thing are really tight-knit people and they are starving for something like this i did not know that at first i knew they were but i did after i had that first meeting where my said yeah there is something here but what was the neatest thing about that meeting is once that happened and started is that how this community and the community even outside the city all joined together you see we just started this idea in 2007 when we actually started thinking let us talk about this we finished it thirty nine months later we raised almost all the money we are about five six million dollars short of raising all the 435 million dollars but we did it because of passionate people who came together quickly and said the time has been too long for something like this remember five and a half percent of population requires assistance every day or they cannot make it through there there is fifteen percent of the population is special-needs we are not talking from a million people we are talking 50 million people in this country who are special need it is a big big number and we are just scratching your surface since we do not have a marketing budget it is word of mouth but we are seeing people come from all over and finding always make a wish we are one the top locations for make-a-wish people come here because this is a place they can go anywhere but organ's wonderland is special it is a special place for our special friends and for all those it is not just about the special needs in the video though it is about everybody being able to play together three out of four people who come to more is where i do not have a special need you see they join in with those who have especially and it brings down that barrier that happened in that pool because then that child who is 21 years old who has the mental capacity of a five year old who is playing in that sand circle feels very comfortable and he is got eight year old and twelve year old playing right around him and that brings down that barrier and that allows him who could go nowhere else and playing a fan circle the opportunity to do that but do it in an environment that he loves a place that he feels safe his family feels comfortable and everybody is working in conjunction for the element of inclusion that is organ's wonderland that is organ's one life now when you let people a lot of them in for free and you put on a lot of free things you do not you are not going to make money that is what organ's wonderland is not about it is not about selling tickets it is about offering a service now how did you do that well i wanted to put something together working with a lot of wonderful people that would would do two things one being economics and one being about explaining that whole element of inclusion and that is next to organ's wonderland is a seventy-five acres soccer park so people always ask me i do not get it cordon soccer especially i do not get it soccer plays a big role why soccer well on what in our thoughts and my feeling about all this is that we need to bring something to san anionic and there is a sport in san anionic that i did not feel was really being properly dealt with from the standpoint of giving quality facilities to and that was soccer so why do not we take something help the overall community tie it next door to a special needs a part that is for those with special needs in the entire community so when thousands of people come and play soccer on these four of 14 different fields they will get that and ask the question what is it and then it will bring awareness you think it brings awareness so you do something good with your community you bring awareness but then you do another thing we rent those fields into renting these top-quality fields we bring money over to organ's wonderland to help with the operations of it it is incredible you can go there and see 7,000 people on a weekend play soccer on these fields when these big tournaments go and these tournaments do not just come from san anionic this region they come from around the state and around the country but when they come here they learn they learn and it brings the exposure up of those who have special needs in the idea of inclusion so let us take it one step further last year we bought a pro soccer team and we are bringing it to san anionic they will start play they will start playing in six months across the street from organ's woodland but then there is going to be a community stadium built right across the street from organ's water line and so through that through the scorpions through all the different events that occur in this community stadium that is being built all with private funds what will ultimately happen is we will bring hundreds of thousands of people and through the most popular sport in the world every time that team travels around north america competing it will be able to talk about soccer but it will also be able to talk about organ's wonderland what is foreland it is a place of inclusion we all bring people together so it plays a revenue source because money from that will ultimately go to organ's winner oil 100% but it will also bring awareness to what it is all about so organ's wonderland is not just the sticks and bricks to me it is about a movement it is about an approach of being able to do something different it is about the idea of saying the time is now to get outside the box let me in was one little thought i get letters and emails from people all the time basically daily telling me about organ's wonderland i love reading him but i got one the other day i want to share with you and it is this lady who this young lady who was leaving with her daughter who was autistic and as they were walking out to the car the young daughter said mom did we just leave heaven and when she told me that i thought to myself we have got a little heaven here on earth at organ's one life thank you very much the opportunity\"}\n",
      "Resultado 4: {'text': \"good morning how are you all i see you are calm i will try to share some tools that as marital said i have been with my company of ecological products for almost 20 years it has allowed me to develop professionally today it is the company that allows us all to live beyond the fact that we have also ventured into other alternative businesses during this time all those alternative businesses generally i do not remember any that turned out well the truth is that these things one tries to do sometimes end in some failures some losses and some bad moments but i like to start this way because if not one always talks only about the good parts of the story and if there is something we have all experienced it is that we learn much more from failures and mistakes than from the things that go well the truth is that it has to do with everything as many of the previous speakers have said we should not be afraid of failures they are just another part of life another part of work well basically i want to share some small tools that have helped me both at work and in some parts of life as well we try to organize and generate some organizational tools which we will be discussing but above all i want to share that i had the opportunity or rather the intention because i had the opportunity but i had the intention to study at the university i graduated as an enologist at an agricultural college which functioned in this great building and when one leaves these traditional tools those that we all know like primary school secondary school university master's degrees languages we sometimes realize that they are not enough when we enter the labor field we see that all these tools are very good very positive but they are not enough so my idea is to share some tools that i found more practical and that can help us tools that can help us to develop a business a life many things that we will be discussing and that will help us as we said all these tools are very good but we see that they are not enough so to organize this i want to make a small analogy of work or life in general with a journey what does this have to do with well we all have to be clear about many things whether the journey is short or long it does not matter we have to know where we are starting from what tools we have for the journey and we need to have a goal where we want to got many things may seem obvious and some speakers have already mentioned them but you will see that these obvious things are not always put into practice when it is time to act for example we need to know where we are where we want to got and how we plan for it for instance how do we plan for monday, how do we start monday, do we have it programmed analyzed and know what we will do this extends into the week the months the years our personal goals our work goals so i insist a lot on making the first analysis knowing exactly our starting point from there obviously the tools we need for the journey will emerge the tools we need to develop ourselves while all these traditional tools are good suddenly we can find many other tools in life that will help us progress one of the main tools is observing observe what observe the people around you to copy what they are doing well to take what you like from them and improve it adapt it to yourself these are all small things that will make us better and make things simpler and better the truth is that if you look around you will find a lot of people from parents friends colleagues all of them have something positive absolutely always you can learn something from them so it is very important to be an observer not just to see but to observe to copy and take the positive aspects also it is important to realize that we cannot surround ourselves with just anyone it may seem obvious but the truth is it is crucial to get closer to people who bring something positive who help us grow who complement us and distance ourselves from those who are negative who do not help who do not contribute make a small analysis of the people around you and you will see that by thinking positively there are many things you can learn and that you have not even noticed yet another typical thing especially as one starts to develop and grow is losing priorities it is fundamental to set priorities we all know examples the typical one who starts to do well and the first thing they do is buy a better care instead of capitalizing on their work it is important to have clear priorities and not lose them as we progress as the situation improves we must capitalize on our achievements and not rush into things another important thing is setting rules we all know we live in a country with many rules or at least many illogical rules but no one forces us to be stuck in that situation we can set our personal rules for example as the owner of my company i never do what i want i do not do what is best for me i do what is best for everyone this is a way of setting rules in the personal sphere in the business sphere we have certifications for several years we have had is certifications for commercialization and they help us stay organized and maintain a work line in a country that sometimes does not help in this sense instead of lamenting we can generate our own rules talking about travel there are many young people here i had the opportunity to play rugby and i got the chance to play in australia for a years and in italy for two years traveling is not easy today but there are endless opportunities and it is worth trying traveling generates personal growth and life experience that you cannot learn elsewhere it is a great way to learn languages and cultures if you get the chance choose wisely direct your efforts to places where you can gain the most like learning a new language finally having clear goals and dreams is essential it is crucial to have a great dream that motivates you no matter how big or small being convinced and determined will give you the strength to reach your goals with determination you can achieve whatever you want that is all thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 5: {'text': \"all right hello so i have had a lifelong fascination with how we organize how we humans work together to express some work or some purpose in the world and i would like to start by sharing a story bit about my journey it is a story that is true and it is become a bit of a metaphor for my own my own path i have a private a harrowing experience pilot's license and when i was first learning to fly i had a rather harrowing experience i am up in the plane i am still a student pilot i have 20-some hours of flight time i yes they let you fly a plane alone with 20-some hours of practice so i am up in this plane it is my first cross-country solo flight so the first time i am flying hundreds of miles away from home with no instructor with me and i am all ready for the journey i go up i start flying little nervous and the low voltage light comes on they do not teach you much about how the plane works right barely not apply the thing so you know what do i do well my first instinct is to you know tap the low voltage light but that does not change anything my next instinct is to check my other instruments to see if there is a big problem here right so one by one i check all of my other instruments the altimeter says you are not losing altitude there is nothing wrong all right the navigation aid says you are perfectly on course congratulations everything's fine the airspeed indicator says you are not losing speed you are flying fast everything's great so i let those other instruments outvote the low voltage light yeah i figured nothing else is reporting anything anomalous it must not be that big of a problem right that was a really bad idea turns out who would have thought that low voltage light is actually tuned in to different information than every other instrument on that control panel oops i nearly crashed the plane that day and fortunately i did make it down there were some steps in the middle there i will skip for you but i made it down and after the adrenaline wears off it occurs to me we do this in our organizations all the time when we humans show up in organizations we become the sensors the instruments for that organizations flight towards its purpose we sense reality on its behalf it is through us that it becomes aware of whatever it needs to deal with or do in the world and we humans are different and we sense different things we have different talents backgrounds different types different talents we sense different things and it is sometimes something sensed by only one person or by the many minority that is critical to integrate into how we proceed and we often ignore them and this really echoed my experience back when i worked in more conventional organizations that was my experience i showed up in a company i wanted to be a sensor for this company i wanted to be an instrument i sensed reality and i wanted to do something with it and i am sure all of you have had the experience of going into some organization somewhere and sensing something important maybe it is a hole in a process or a way to improve something that is not working as well as it could be something slipping through the cracks and i would often have those experiences but have nothing i could do to act on them right there would be no way to integrate that into the organization in fact i no way to integrate learned early on that if the boss did not sense it i was not gonna get it processed have you ever seen that you know you sense something important but the boss just does not see it good luck that shuts down the organization's capacity to integrate and harness whatever it was that i tuned in to find the low-voltage light were in trouble so my quest since then has been how can we humans show up as sensors for our organizations and i did the only logical thing i was i became a boss this is more personal now how can i show up and to be a sensor for organization the only logical thing once i realized that anything i sensed that the boss did not was not gonna get address well i became a boss right that is nice and simple now i get to really run things the way i think they should be you know and unfortunately i realized there was still another boss you know so after climbing the corporate ladder a bit i got fed up with that and realized all right the only way i am really going to be able to process anything my sense is if i drop out of this whole game and start my own company where i get to be the coo at the top and now there is no boss getting in the way of processing whatever it is i am sensing so i did that i started a software company and built it over many years and you know at first that worked great i could get a lot of the stuff i sensed processed but then something unfortunate happened i realized well i am not even able to even as the coo as this company's growing i am not even able to take everything that i see and get it processed the systems are not responsive enough right the way we have structured and built our organizations today does not let me even as the coo get everything i sense integrated and harnessed and processed and that was not actually the worst of it the far more painful realization was i had just built the very system that i had struggled so long and tried to move past right now everyone else in that company did not get whatever it was that they could tune into and sense harnessed and integrated unless i saw it and no matter how much i might work on myself focus on my own development try to be the most empowering servant leader i can be the reality is i am still a human i still have bad days i still miss things right and i had built the very system that i had tried to escape so my question then shifted a bit it became how do i build something different and how do i build a system where that is not the case where anything since by anyone can integrate and change the organization to help it better express whatever work it is doing in the world so one of the things we attention realized is there is incredible energy there in the things we sense when we tune in to a gap between where we are and what could be right we call this attention because we often sense it as tension right that it is not just intellectual it is that feeling in your gut the frustration that comes when you see a process that you know could be better or you are banging your head into the same damn problem multiple times you feel tense you feel this tension about it could also be an opportunity if something exciting but it is this gap between where we are and where you sense we could be and just like a rubber band stretched between two points there is such energy there although we often tension experience it as a negative i do not mean it that way at all and if we can do something with it becomes energy not frustration right the root of the word tension in satin tense era means to stretch it is a stretch so how can we power an organization fuel its continual evolution its continual updating how it works and how we work together based on these tensions that we sense so interesting question hard thing to do and we tried a lot of things so we experimented over years we tried running an organization via consensus seemed like a good idea at the time it was a complete disaster if you ever want to sit in long painful meetings all the time and never get anything done try running your organization with consensus what i realized was there is a consensus big difference between having a voice and actually being able to do something with your voice being able to actually process everything you sense into some kind of meaningful change consensus did not do it in fact often that would result in long painful meetings where we all tried to get everyone to see it the same way i do not want my low voltage light to have to see things the same way as my fuel gauge i do not need that and it is not a healthy system in fact i want to let each of them sense what they can sense best and all integrate into the flight plan so how can we have an organization where any tension sense by anyone anywhere in the company has someplace to go to get rapidly and reliably processed into meaningful change that was the question consensus did not work so we tried other things and we started finding approaches we started coming up with something and one of the first things we realized on that journey is we actually need to harness autocratic harness autocratic authority the very thing we moved away from in the beginning right autocratic authority because if we are sensing on behalf of the organization and we want to be dynamic and fast and responsive which we have to be to process everything everyone senses most of the things we sense we need to act on locally we need to be not just sensors but actors in this system and to do that we need the authority to act without having to go to a painful meeting and try to get everybody bought into every decision you want to make in cells in the human body other words we need to be a lot more like cells in the human body each one needs a clear boundary within which it has autonomy that has authority but what you do not see is a coo cell right a manager cell directing the others what to do each cell has its own autonomy but it is distributed that is the direction we moved in a system where everybody has autocratic authority but they know the bounds of their authority they know the interconnections they know when they have to get somebody ease's input or when they have to integrate with someone they know the bounds of their authority and the connections they know what they the process can expect of each other and in most organizations we have managers to fill the central point to do that to align all of us and to distribute authority but we have already covered the limits of that so how can we do that without managers in the way well for that we need a process if we do not have managers to align and integrate we need a process which aligns and integrates a process which lets each of us be a sovereign autonomous agent on behalf of this organization and its purpose and integrate in other words we need something that is a lot less like a feudal hierarchy and a lot more like a constitutional entity and that is exactly what we have so in my organization i work in every day i get to experience this it is quite liberating in my organization now we have no coo we have no managers every individual partner in that firm has real authority that no one else can trump but it is distributed we each have different authority and we know the bounds and the limits of each and we have a constitution that defines how we integrate together a constitution that defines a governance process which is not governed of the people by the people for the people but rather is governance of the organization through the people as sensors for the purpose whatever it is we are here to do together when we have that kind of tangible system real processes that hold and distribute real authority and integrate us and figure out how do we need to interconnect and align expectations when that process allows everyone to have a voice for the sake of the purpose and when you have a process to integrate anything you sense conclusion anything you sense whatsoever any constraint on expressing this this purpose in the world and you can integrate it and change and reshape the organization dynamically in real time reshape how we work together what authority everyone has you have got a system that is dramatically more responsive and adaptable without the waste of managers in the way limiting what tensions you can process all of this we have captured in what we call a new social technology for organizations it is a new operating system it is tangible that constitutions available on our website and you can find it you can find organizations running with it all over the world now it is spreading is called holacracy you can find more at our website holacracy or and learn a bit more about how this system aligns us to each to the purpose each of us to the purpose while giving us the freedom and autonomy and yet an integrated whole thank you\"}\n"

      "Resultado 1: {'text': \"i have a problem how many times do we say that and we tend to think that it is because we have problems that we struggle in life it is not true if we struggle in life it is because we have parts within ourselves parts who are suffering parts who are afraid and most importantly who believe nothing can be changed this is the reason why we struggle up until a few months ago i thought i had a problem which was that i found it hard to speak about me in public on a personal level but i did oka because as a doctor most often it was related to medical or scientific topics and as a results there was no discomfort until the day i received a call from someone who means a great deal to me and who invited me to talk about my experience on the use of the psychotherapy model which i am introducing to you tonight and that i use at my hospital but he did ask specifically for me to make it personal since it was my experience and i quickly declined his invitation because there was a little voice inside my head telling me you have nothing of interest to say well i thought i was at peace with that but then few weeks or months later that same person calls me up again and again asks for me to present at that time i thought there most certainly was something to unravel here because if this person who means a lot to me asks again for me to come and talk about my experience there is something unfinished about this at first i asked him to give me a little time told him that i needed to think it through and i used this time to look inwards to look inwards to know who was telling me that i had nothing interesting to say to other people on a personal level to do so it is important to take a moment here is how i did it i focused inwards on this voice calmly and in a curious manner who is it at first all i heard was this message you have nothing of interest to say and then as i kept asking i heard something else if this person really knew you he would not ask you to do that he really has no idea who you are you have nothing interesting to say it went on for a while after a while i realized that this voice came from a person a part of me and that this person had all the traits of a critics a judge from within this was an important discovery because i could really become aware of the presence of this person and as a results i could genuinely talk with him ask him questions such as why do you keep on telling me all this why do you have this purpose in my life to criticize me to judge me the way you do what are you afraid of if i did accept the invitation and went to the conference to talk about myself it was really interesting because all of a sudden the tone changed and instead of criticism came something quite moving deep inside i am afraid that you may relive something hard you have experienced before so first i thanked this part for his caring intention and i then asked it know would you agree to step aside and to let me reconnect with this hardship you want to prevent me from reliving he agreed to that and behind this part of me was another part a little boy eight years of age he was standing by the door of the apartment i used to live in at the time he was standing absolutely frozen and he did not know i was there because for all these years the critic was standing between the two of us and so it took a little time for this little boy to realize that i was there and that i was there for him and so we started talking open heatedly i asked him if he would want to tell me about himself his story why he was frozen we took a moment and talked about his suffering his emotions once he turned to me and recognized me and trusted me enough he started explaining to me telling me things things i already knew but he said them again from deep inside his heart told me that he was the youngest of a family who was going through a hard time then with many agencies to deal with and that whenever this little boy wanted to talk about himself there was no room no time for that as a consequences he ended up thinking that what he thought was important to say in his heart was of no interest since nobody cared or so it seemed to him this was an important time because from this moment on he felt completely understood and so i asked him now that he knew i understood him whether he would leave the past behind and be interested to join me in the present whether he was interested in changing his way of life clearly he was and so i told him for this to happen there is something important for you to do it is to get rid of everything linked to this hardship and that still weighs on you he agreed to do so to relieve himself of his burden and to my great surprise i met a bold adventurous little boy very eager to join me and go to this conference once this change had taken place i turned to the critic and asked so how are things for you now do you still need to play this role in my life and once again to my surprise he said no i do not need to anymore i see that you can take care of this boy he is safe now i then asked would you accept to play another part to do something else less difficult less burdening he said woke i will be your adviser now i will assist you so the little boy the adviser and myself got to work we prepared the conference and people quite liked it why did i choose to tell you this story here tonight after all it is a story pertaining to familiar elements being hurt being defensive and maybe one would frown upon such a happy ending still there are key points i want to share with you linked to my own experience both with this little boy but also with the therapy model i came here to tell you about first the importance to meet the parts within ourselves how important this relationship is second why is it stuck inside as a result of what and that not dealing with it will prevent any change thirdly it can change there is a plan be what i did when i looked within was that i connected with it i could have talked to somebody about my problem i even could have mentioned my parts to them but instead i went within myself francs within franchise and connected with these parts first the critics then the boy and this is essential because when a connection is created from within myself changes occur a feeling of security and trust emerges and this allows for an important thing to happen which is for this critic to show himself beyond what he tells me who he truly is his underlying positive intention towards me he wanted to protect me it allows him to take a risk the second thing was why was it all stuck inside why was the boy stuck in the apartment the answer is quite simple it is because of his burden what is his burden it is the suffering which is attached to the hardship and this suffering is still there it was in or on the little boy the little boy was stuck there thinking he was not interesting the problem with the burden and the parts of us bearing it is that these parts absorb it all these parts believe they are the burden itself they forgot that they are merely bearing it they believe they are it and as a results this burden becomes a poison a genuine poison bums in our societies we like them so long as they are far enough from us they are dirty they stink they drink they yell they are unclean and so we tend to stay away from these members of society the same thing happens within ourselves there are parts of ourselves who are not attractive who stink who have experienced such hardships that have come to be unworthy of love because they are not pretty inside and so within ourselves we do the same thing we do with bums we shield ourselves from them and isolate them inside how do we do that well it is quite simple actually there are other parts in us who are quite good at this and create a protective barrier they are called protectors so who are the protectors well they are these parts in us which are linked to our habits our reassuring ways of dealing with things for example taking a little pill before going to bed because it is a little too hard without it or to have a couple of glasses because there is a difficult meeting ahead and we want to be relaxed or this overwhelming urge to succeed in life or to rely on your intellect to understand everything or to do sports because one has to release one's energy somehow and calm one's anxiety all these behaviors which are a little bit over the top which make us feel like we do not really have a choice in the matter these are the protectors within us there are parts within us doing all this and fortunately so because they help us cope with our pain they help prevent us from feeling down and when we feel down because we are in contact with these wounded parts they help us getting away from them because it is just too painful to stay there the problem is that these parts are scared because they know that if they stop what they are doing the fire of pain will rise again in our lives and so this fear prevents them from stopping why well since the wounded parts are convinced that they are their own burden that they are dirty the protective parts have no choice but to protect them and behave in our lives sometimes to extremes even to the point of being destructive either for us or for others this is the first tragedy the second tragedy is that we end up thinking the same thing they do that change is not an option that we are stuck with this forever and that is why it is important to know that there is a plan be plan b is the plan you use whenever what you tried first did not succeed plan a is i am hurt i protect myself plan b is something else it is doing what i did it is going within myself francs within franchise meeting these parts it is important because first it allows for the understanding of the intention the history the pain but mostly it brings security it allows for my protectors your protectors to stand aside enough so that i in a loving way can access these wounded parts and when these parts feel the compassion and love they agree to do what my little boy did which is to release their burden and to come back to their real nature and from then on our protective parts can consider stopping what they do what they are exhausted doing and causes us problems in life this person this francs within francs who could do all this is like a flame inside it is who i really am deep inside of me in the ifs psychotherapy model i am introducing to you tonight the internal family systems model this flame is called the self and i would like to leave you with a message that we share the adviser the little boy and myself this message is that this self is always here no matter what happened to us even the worst situations even in the most chronic situations this flame is always here available as an invitation to our protectors to trust and an invitation to these suffering parts to relieve themselves from their pain an invitation to our parts to relieve themselves from what weighs on them and come back to their true nature thank you\"}\n",
      "Resultado 2: {'text': 'my story is different from most because i had to undergo a bone marrow transplant when i was just 6 months old and now i have pulmonary fibrosis which is a serious lung disease and my lung capacity is now only 20%. my name is wish chaudhary and i am 17-years-old and today i would like to talk about i what really matters most to me in life now life can be tough when every single breath you take is a struggle and the slightest infection causes a serious life-threatening exacerbation and the last one for me was in nonmember last year when i went from being able to walk around freely and go to school to suddenly being bedridden unable to turn over in bed without getting out of breath and i must confess that i did wonder if i was going to die and i would have sleepless nights just thinking tossing and turning with this idea that i soon i may be gone and if that is going to happen i then what is the point of anything i would think about this for hours and get nowhere but then it suddenly struck me that i am not really alone in all of this is it not true that not just me but all of us are going to die one day yes all of us are going to die i would like you all to just think about that for a moment in the next 100 years all of us sitting in this room today will be gone just at different times some sooner than the others so then if death is the ultimate truth what should really matter most in life the only thing that matters to me is being happy and happiness is a choice one makes it is simply an attitude i can either choose to be happy and try to smile through all of my difficult times or i can choose to be miserable and get overwhelmed by it all now it is not that by being miserable that i am going to get any better so i may as well choose to be happy and if i have to have pulmonary fibrosis i choose to have a happy pulmonary fibrosis now i would like to share with you a few difficult moments in the recent past where i have chosen to be happy this year i was quite unwell and i had to undergo several medical tests and one such test was a sleep study done to check if my oxygen levels were okay when i sleep and this picture was taken right before the study and you can see that i am almost trapped in a bunch of wires some stuck to my face and some to my body to monitor my heart my brain and my breathing despite all of this i am still smiling because i refuse to let this illness get the better of me i just will not let it and i chose to find humor in observing the man who was doing my sleep study i could not help but laugh at the way he would just put up his own feet on my bed and go off to sleep himself snoring away and this obviously made it difficult for me to sleep and maybe that is why my results were so bad how ridiculous i thought to myself later that month my family and i had to go to inland for a full medical checkup and the days were filled with long boring medical appointments talking about lung transplant and what seemed like endless amounts of tests this is a picture of my brother and i just after i had spent one long day at the hospital but guess where we were headed in this photo i to see a roadway show in condone and it was fabulous i was able to put the trauma of the day at the hospital behind me and i still managed to find the will and the excitement in going out for a play and spending quality time with my brother i believe that it is important to create many happy memories so that we can try to wipe out the sad ones after having quite an unpleasant summer with all of these medical issues my family and i decided to take a holiday to the maldives and there was so much to do in the maldives but of course my health did not permit me to do a lot of the things that i wanted to and one of the main activities was snorkeling and i desperately wanted to try it but how could a person who has difficulty breathing go snorkeling well in this picture you can see me in my snorkeling gear right after i had popped my head out of the water i would seen the most beautiful vibrant colored fish and i am not going to lie i did only dip my head in for a second but i did what i wanted to do and that moment for me was worth everything and i felt extreme happiness and was even surprised at myself for doing something that everyone was not sure was really possible so happiness is clearly a choice one can make no matter what no matter where i you can find it if you look for it in fact tom willow once said i a smile is happiness you can find right under your nose.\"\" i feel that happiness is also doing what you truly love and for me my love is for art simply because it allows me to express myself in such a beautiful and unique way as i dip my brush in the vibrant colors of paint and can almost feel the paint being smeared on to the fabric of the canvas i tend to forget all of my worries and the difficult situation that i am really in and art makes me happy because it almost becomes a whole another world where i can escape at lease for a little while and these days my most favorite subject to paint is dogs and now i would like to introduce you to my own two dogs copy the abrader and roll the black pug you can see who the dominant one is in the relationship i find it so interesting that even though they cannot speak a word dogs can become the closest thing to your heart your very best friend and your companion i love to observe them and try to figure them out and i cannot help but get inspired dogs are so similar to humans yet they carry qualities that we humans struggle to achieve at times dogs can find happiness in the smallest of things dogs are delighted with a walk ecstatic with a small treat and in heaven when you tickle their belly now i would like to share with you a few paintings i have done recently that were inspired by these two guys the first one is of copy and is capturing a snapshot of my everyday life just lying on my bed and watching movies just as i love to do the next one it is inspired by my gorgeous pug roll and the legendary rock band guns no roses and now all of this does not mean that life is always one big song and dance it really is not of course there are days when i feel extremely down where i feel like simply curling up into a ball and just giving up but then the realization that things could always be much much worse i always pushes me to get back up on my feet and put a smile on my face i could have easily been born into a family that was not as loving and caring as my own so i thank god for the family that i have and i know for a fact that there are children out there who are much less fortunate that i am and although i have this disease i am still grateful that i can walk around and do what i love to do so happiness is an attitude happiness is doing what you truly love and i feel that happiness can only come from acceptance i accept who i am i accept where i am at and i accept the challenges that i am battling with today and i am even more determined to make the most of this wonderful gift of life that god has given me as andiron once said i enjoy life there is plenty of time to be dead.\"\" so i really hope that all of you enjoy your lives with as much happiness as you can possibly find thank you for listening \"'}\n",
      "Resultado 3: {'text': \"i am here to help you do even more unzipping of your minds and of your hearts moxie clay came out here and challenged your expectations and i am going to ask you to unzip and let your expectations fall out and push them aside all together because they are holding you back expectations are those lists of things what are expectations we build up that tell us how things should be they keep us feeling safe and they also often prevent us from being fully present in our lives and from living to our highest potential so i am going to tell you about my journey away from expectation which also turned out to be a journey toward self empowerment and hope and then how it might apply to your relationships as well i first learned about the power of letting go of expectation on my journey back to my natural family my birth family i am adopted and my adoption is a fairly standard post world war two story in great brain my natural parents live next door to each other in a small town near the east coast of scotland and when they finished high school they went to the west of scotland to glasgow a whopping 38 miles away my father went to heathers story glasgow university my mother went to nursing school and when she became pregnant they decided they were going to get married but they were going to wait and tell their families when they went home on christian break so they expected to end that year by becoming a family that was remember 1966 what they got instead was a tearful break up outside my father's garage from my mother that was followed by a stay at a mothering home a daughter who left the hospital before she did a bill for my foster care and ultimately my adoption my father paid penance by working as a bricklayer for a year before he to university in edinburgh they never saw each other again whatever expectations they had were letting go of expectations shattered on top of that they were told that they should be grateful privileged that they had a chance to redeem themselves and move on this is all pretty standard stuff for that time in place and i am telling you this because i want to note that although my parents learned not to expect in the wake of our separation this is not the productive kind of letting go the kind of letting go that they learned is rooted in shame and in punishment there is not any hope in it it is about shutting down and what i would like us to do today is learn how to let go and open up so fast-forward 18 years from that tearful breakup in the garage my adoptive father my dad had made it clear that he would totally understand if i wanted to go and find my natural family this is a lot easier in scotland than it is here they do not alter birth certificates the adoptee has the rights to all the records so i took myself off to the house of records in edinburgh and got hold of my birth certificate it had my birth name my mother's name her then address it took me another 18 years to decide to search the lead up to that would take another tedtalk or two mostly something had shifted inside me on a trip back in 2003 i walked past the house listed on the birth certificate and i just could not let it go after that i was led entirely by my gut i kind of had to be adoptee are less than i of the population only a few of assert and only a fraction of the people who search actually wind up being in reunion there are not enough of us for there to be a guidebook and for me this turned out to be a good thing it did help that i had had my own child my first child in somewhat similar circumstances to my own birth it also helped that i knew two other friends who were adoptee who were in reunion they had gone into the reunion with a litany of expectations one friend was in a relationship with her natural father that could best be termed as clandestine the other friend's father drank himself into ice the first time they met their relationships with all their natural families were fraught to say the least so i went in with an awareness of the letting go of hope risks i looked clearly at the risks and i decided to go ahead i went in also trying to pare back to what i really hoped without the expectation and what i hoped was to find my natural mother i wanted to know where i came from yes part of me did want the opah style reunion you know the one where you go and the whole gigantic attractive successful natural family welcomes the adoptee on whom they have been waiting their whole lives but i did not go expecting it i pared back and back to what was driving the hope i knew i had to hang on to that i knew i had to be whole and i had to expect nothing when i felt ready to do that i contacted birth link in scotland this is a nonprofit agency that helps adoptee and their families connect with each other i put my name on the list for a searcher that takes some months so in the waiting time i searched more deeply within myself i asked myself all kinds of odd questions what would i do if i found my mother and she was dying and needed my help what would i make of it if i found her and she was alcoholic obese if she was destitute a retired prostitute and i realized that anything that would bother me deeply would do so because i already saw it as a weakness in myself in other words anything i might want her to change was really something i wanted to change in myself i believe this is also called owning your own stuff owning your own stuff also talk to my brother he is also adopted and he said look heather the only thing you really have to worry about is if you go to meet her and she comes to the door with her bags packed and goes alright darling we are we going cut she thinks she is moving in with you anything else you can just run away from start is often good for a little bit of comedy with some truth embedded and he was right either one of us could end the relationship at any moment and is not that the case with all our relationships we behave as though in our relationships especially our significant ones we behave as though we are operating with some kind of a relationship union like a pipe fitters union that is going to uphold our expectation contract but the truth is relationships live in a right-to-work state any party and sometimes a third party like sudden death can end the contract with no notice and no cause and that is a scary truth to face but as with any other no guidebook truth all the expectation in the world cannot stop it what i knew what my net natural parents and i had lived for nearly four decades before we came face-to-face is that expectation does not guarantee you a thing so i entered the relationship knowing the risks i entered the relationship owning what i brought i entered the relationship without that guidebook and here's the good thing about there not being a guidebook there are not any articles about what a good reunion looks like like the articles you read that imply that all the other married couples have more sex than you the skinny woman next door eats cherry pie for breakfast the other guy's business makes more money than yours and it is more fun to work there all the things that build up our expectations and they record chances of honoring what is right in front of us so when i entered the relationship in this rest in way what i found that i was able to really rest in and notice small moments and to take joy there i noticed for instance the grain of my mother's freckled hand wrapped around her mug of tea the first time we met i got to experience her with the surest sureness of adulthood and the heart of a child i did not have my expectation checklist running through my head that is what expectations do they tend to run through our head act like a third party in our relationship constantly vying for our attention and that feels okay when things match up but even then we have stepped away from the moment and the relationship to check in with them and when things do not measure up then we really go aside we start talking to expectation asking it for affirmation he should have brought me flowers should not he she should run those meetings on time and our expectation list says oh yes honey you are right get back in there and make them do it your way so you keep asking and asking and getting grumpier and grumpier when things do not measure up if you have asked a couple of times and you have not gotten the response you wanted you are probably not going to get it and in that stepping away to measure up with expectation you have missed the moment and the relationship as it unfolded that might have offered a path forward and even when the worst thing happens when your expectations are not met and another path forward is not on offer you are then resting in the truth and you can choose to move yourself forward from the truth of that relationship in that moment expectation does not stop painful stuff from happening it just blames it on somebody else what expectations do is pull us out of the moment they hold us in an infinite loop of false possibility so i challenge you today to free yourself from this loop of false possibility before you leave this building this afternoon think of one relationship that has one unfulfilled expectation in it let the expectation go search yourself own your stuff commit to entering your next interaction in that relationship without the expectation hanging on to some hope and then just allowing yourself to fully rest in the reality of the moment whatever needs or wants you might have it is possible that those can be met in some other way but not by this person at this moment settle your heart to that and then move yourself forward i think you will find that if you can be brave enough to rest in reality human and flawed and possibly beautiful reality it will take you places better than you have ever dared to expect\"}\n",

      "Resultado 5: {'text': \"what keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life if you were going to invest now in your future best self where would you put your time and your energy there was a recent survey of millennial asking them what their most important life goals were and over 80 % said that a major life goal for them was to get rich and another 50 % of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous and we are constantly told to lean in to work to push harder and achieve more we are given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them those pictures are almost impossible to get most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but 2020. we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative but what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study many people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy we did that the hazard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that is ever been done for 75 years we have tracked the lives of 724 men year after years asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball further down the field but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived about 60 of our original 724 men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s. and we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men and i am the fourth director of the study since 1938, we have tracked the lives of two groups of men the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at hazard college they all finished college during world war i and then most went off to serve in the war and the second group that we have followed was a group of boys from button's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boson of the 1930s. most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed they were given medical exams we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top and some made that journey in the opposite direction the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today 75 years later telling you that the study still continues every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives many of the inner city boson men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just is not that interesting the hazard men never ask that question to get the clearest picture of these lives we do not just send them questionnaires we interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records from their doctors we draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said it is about time so what have we learned what are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we have generated on these lives well the lessons are not about wealth or fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get from this 75 year study is this good relationships keep us happier and healthier period we have learned three big lessons about relationships the first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier they are physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five america will report that they are lonely and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that it is not just the number of friends you have and it is not whether or not you are in a committed relationship but it is the quality of your close relationships that matters it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health high conflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective once we had followed our men all all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who was not and when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it was not their middle'-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old it was how satisfied they were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men and women reported in their is that on the days when they had more physical pain their moods stayed just as happy but the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain and the third big lesson that we learn about relationships on our health is that good relationships do not just protect our bodies they protect our brains it turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your is is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those people's memories stay sharper longer and the people in relationships where they feel they really cannot count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier memory decline and those good relationships they do not have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments did not take a toll on their memories so this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well'-being, this is wisdom that is as old as the hills why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore well we are human what we would really like is a quick fix something we can get that will make our lives good and keep them that way relationships are messy and they are complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends that is not sexy or glamorous it is also lifelong it never ends the people in our 75'-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates just like the millennial in that recent survey many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life but over and over over these 75 years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let us say you are 25 or you are 40 or you are 60. what might leaning into relationships even look like well the possibilities are practically endless it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member who you have not spoken to in years because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges i would like to close with a quote from mark twain more than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this there is not time so brief is life for bickering apologies heart burnings callings to account there is only time for loving but an instant so to speak for that the good life is built with good relationships thank you\"}\n"
