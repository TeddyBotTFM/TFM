"so i will start with this a couple years ago an event planner called me because i was going to do a speaking event and she called and she said i am really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyers and i thought well what is the struggle and she said well i saw you speak and i am going to call you a researchers i think but i am afraid if i call you a researchers no one will come because they will think you are boring and irrelevant laughter and i was like ""okay."" and she said but the thing i liked about your talk is you are a storyteller so i think what i will do is just call you a storyteller and of course the academic insecure part of me was like you are going to call me a what and she said i am going to call you a storyteller and i was like why not magic pixie's laughter i was like let me think about this for a second i tried to call deep on my courage and i thought you know i am a storyteller i am a qualitative researchers i collect stories that is what i do and maybe stories are just data with a soul and maybe i am just a storyteller and so i said you know what why do not you just say i am a researcher-storyteller."" and she went ha had there is no such thing laughter so i am a researcher-storyteller, and i am going to talk to you today we are talking about expanding perception and so i want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that i live and love and work and parents and this is where my story starts when i was a young researchers doctoral student my first years i had a research professor who said to us there is the thing if you cannot measure it it does not exist and i thought he was just sweet-talking me i was like ""really?"" and he was like ""absolutely."" and so you have to understand that i have a bachelor's and a master's in social work and i was getting my ph.d. in social work so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the life's messy love it and i am more of the life's messy clean it up organize it and put it into a bent box laughter and so to think that i had found my way to found a career that takes me really one of the big sayings in social work is clean into the discomfort of the work and i am like knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all as that was my mantra so i was very excited about this and so i thought you know what this is the career for me because i am interested in some messy topics but i want to be able to make them not messy i want to understand them i want to hack into these things that i know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see so where i started was with connection because by the time you are a social worker for 10 years what you realize is that connection is why we are here it is what gives purpose and meaning to our lives this is what it is all about it does not matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice mental health and abuse and neglect what we know is that connection the ability to feel connected is neurobiologically that is how we are wired it is why we are here so i thought you know what i am going to start with connection well you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss and she tells you 37 things that you do really awesome and one opportunity for growth laughter and all you can think about is that opportunity for growth right well apparently this is the way my work went as well because when you ask people about love they tell you about heartbreak when you ask people about belonging they will tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded and when you ask people about connection the stories they told me were about disconnection so very quickly really about six weeks into this research i ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that i did not understand or had never seen and so i pulled back out of the research and thought i need to figure out what this is and it turned out to be shame and shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection is there something about me that if other people know it or see it that i will not be worthy of connection the things i can tell you about it it is universal we all have it the only people who do not experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection no one wants to talk about it and the less you talk about it the more you have it what underpinned this shame this i am not good enough which we all know that feeling i am not blank enough i am not thin enough rich enough beautiful enough smart enough promoted enough the thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability this idea of in order for connection to happen we have to allow ourselves to be seen really seen and you know how i feel about vulnerability i hate vulnerability and so i thought this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick i am going in i am going to figure this stuff out i am going to spend a years i am going to totally deconstruct shame i am going to understand how vulnerability works and i am going to outsmart it so i was ready and i was really excited as you know it is not going to turn out well laughter you know this so i could tell you a lot about shame but i would have to borrow everyone ease's time but here's what i can tell you that it boils down to and this may be one of the most important things that i have ever learned in the decade of doing this research my one year turned into six years thousands of stories hundreds of long interviews focus groups at one point people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories thousands of pieces of data in six years and i kind of got a handle on it i kind of understood this is what shame is this is how it works i wrote a book i published a theory but something was not okay and what it was is that if i roughly took the people i interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness that is what this comes down to a sense of worthiness they have a strong sense of love and belonging and folks who struggle for it and folks who are always wondering if they are good enough there was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it and that was the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they are worthy of love and belonging that is it they believe they are worthy and to me the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we are not worthy of connection was something that personally and professionally i felt like i needed to understand better so what i did is i took all of the interviews where i saw worthiness where i saw people living that way and just looked at those what do these people have in common i have a slight office supply addiction but that is another talk so i had a manila folder and i had a sharpie and i was like what am i going to call this research and the first words that came to my mind were ""whole-hearted."" these are wholehearted people living from this deep sense of worthiness so i wrote at the top of the manila folder and i started looking at the data in fact i did it first in a four-day, very intensive data analysis where i went back pulled the interviews the stories pulled the incidents what is the theme what is the pattern my husband left town with the kids because i always go into this jacks pollock crazy thing where i am just writing and in my researcher model and so here's what i found what they had in common was a sense of courage and i want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minutes courage the original definition of courage when it first came into the english language it is from the satin word ""cor,"" meaning heart and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart and so these folks had very simply the courage to be imperfect they had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others because as it turns out we cannot practice compassion with other people if we cannot treat ourselves kindly and the last was they had connection and this was the hard part as a result of authenticity they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were which you have to absolutely do that for connection the other thing that they had in common was this they fully embraced vulnerability they believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful they did not talk about vulnerability being comfortable nor did they really talk about it being excruciating as i had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing they just talked about it being necessary they talked about the willingness to say i love you first ... the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ... the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram they are willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out they thought this was fundamental i personally thought it was betrayal i could not believe i had pledged allegiance to research where our job you know the definition of research is to control and predict to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict and now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting this led to a little breakdown laughter which actually looked more like this laughter and it did i call it a breakdown my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening laughter a spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown but i assure you it was a breakdown and i had to put my data away and go find a therapist let me tell you something you know who you are when you call your friends and say i think i need to see somebody do you have any recommendations because about five of my friends were like ""wooo, i would not want to be your therapist laughter i was like what does that mean and they are like i am just saying you know do not bring your measuring stick laughter i was like ""okay."" so i found a therapist my first meeting with her liana i brought in my list of the way the wholehearted live and i sat down and she said how are you and i said i am great i am okay she said what is going on and this is a therapist who sees therapists because we have to go to those because their best meters are good laughter and so i said there is the thing i am struggling and she said what is the struggle and i said well i have a vulnerability issue and i know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness but it appears that it is also the birthplace of joy of creativity of belonging of love and i think i have a problem and i need some help and i said but here's the thing no family stuff no childhood shit laughter i just need some strategies laughter applause thank you so she goes like this laughter and then i said it is bad right and she said it is neither good nor bad laughter it just is what it is and i said oh my god this is going to suck laughter and it did and it did not and it took about a years and you know how there are people that when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important that they surrender and walk into it a that is not me and be i do not even hang out with people like that laughter for me it was a yearlong street fight it was a slugfest. vulnerability pushed i pushed back i lost the fight but probably won my life back and so then i went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they the wholehearted what choices they were making and what we are doing with vulnerability why do we struggle with it so much am i alone in struggling with vulnerability not so this is what i learned we numb vulnerability when we are waiting for the call it was funny i sent something out on twitter and on casebook that says how would you define vulnerability what makes you feel vulnerable and within an hour and a half i had 150 responses because i wanted to know what is out there having to ask my husband for help because i am sick and we are newly married initiating sex with my husband initiating sex with my wife being turned down asking someone out waiting for the doctor to call back getting laid off laying off people this is the world we live in we live in a vulnerable world and one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability and i think there is evidence and it is not the only reason this evidence exists but i think it is a huge cause we are the most indent ... obese ... addicted and medicated adult cohort in us history the problem is and i learned this from the research that you cannot selectively numb emotions you cannot say here's the bad stuff here's vulnerability here's grief here's shame here's fear here's disappointment i do not want to feel these i am going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin laughter i do not want to feel these and i know that is knowing laughter i hack into your lives for a living god laughter you cannot numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects our emotions you cannot selectively numb so when we numb those we numb joy we numb gratitude we numb happiness and then we are miserable and we are looking for purpose and meaning and then we feel vulnerable so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin and it becomes this dangerous cycle one of the things that i think we need to think about is why and how we numb and it does not just have to be addiction the other thing we do is we make everything that is uncertain certain religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty i am right you are wrong shut up that is it just certain the more afraid we are the more vulnerable we are the more afraid we are this is what politics looks like today there is no discourse anymore there is no conversation there is just blame you know how blame is described in the research a way to discharge pain and discomfort we perfect if there is anyone who wants their life to look like this it would be me but it does not work because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks laughter which just i hope in 100 years people will look back and got ""wow."" laughter and we perfect most dangerously our children let me tell you what we think about children they are hardwired for struggle when they get here and when you hold those perfect little babies in your hands our job is not to say look at her she is perfect my job is just to keep her perfect make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and male by seventh that is not our job our job is to look and say you know what you are imperfect and you are wired for struggle but you are worthy of love and belonging that is our job show me a generation of kids raised like that and we will end the problems i think that we see today we pretend that what we do does not have an effect on people we do that in our personal lives we do that corporate whether it is a bailout an oil spill ... a recall we pretend like what we are doing does not have a huge impact on other people i would say to companies this is not our first rodeo people we just need you to be authentic and real and say ... we are sorry we will fix it but there is another way and i will leave you with this this is what i have found to let ourselves be seen deeply seen vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts even though there is no guarantee and that is really hard and i can tell you as a parents that is excruciatingly difficult to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror when we are wondering can i love you this much can i believe in this this passionately can i be this fierce about this just to be able to stop and instead of catastrophizing what might happen to say i am just so grateful because to feel this vulnerable means i am alive and the last which i think is probably the most important is to believe that we are enough because when we work from a place i believe that says i am enough ... then we stop screaming and start listening we are kinder and gentler to the people around us and we are kinder and gentler to ourselves that is all i have thank you",brent brown,the power of the vulnerability
okay so today i am gonna talk about something that all of you probably have in your hands in your backpacks in your pockets and you carry with you all the time and you probably do not think too much about it unless you are worried about its battery running out right and that is this mobile phone but i want you to think about this in 2011 1.5 billion mobile phones were sold worldwide and the average user upgrades their phone after only two years where do you think all those mobile phones away well if people are like me a lot of those phones are sitting in a drawer somewhere the phones that you see behind you for example are in my junk drawer in my kitchen two phones an pod touch so as a fraction 50% of the mobile phones in my house and 100% of the pod touches in my house are sitting in the junk drawer right now that is good because they are not in a landfill so i must feel somehow that these phones have some kind of value but you know sometimes we move it is time to clean out that junk drawer what am i gonna do with those phones to dispose of them in a way which is environmentally responsible right now there are two main options for disposal options for the end of life of your disposal mobile phone or any electronics okay the obvious one is to recycle it so you take the phone you crush it you extract its valuable raw materials so these are things like glass copper chromium and those materials go back into our industrial ecosystem to make new stuff okay that is a great option 100 percent of old phones should be recycled but it turns out in 2012 people projected that only 15% of old phones were going to be end up in the recycling stream okay so clearly i am not the only one who has their own phones in their drawer second option is what is called refurbishing so you take your phone to a business and that business cleans up the phone and they sell it to another consumer to use as a mobile phone now this sounds like a really great option because you would think that for every old phone that gets refurbished that means one less new mobile phone has to be manufactured but turns out it is not the case experts believe that only that refurbishing mobile phones only decreases new phone production by about i and there is a lot of reasons for that but one main reasons is that the customer who tends to buy refurbished mobile phones usually a first-time mobile customer and as soon as they can afford to they are gonna upgrade to a phone with the latest and greatest features now the phones i go into drawers most phones and they go into drawers are not dead right they still turn on they have working speakers microphones displays they have a microprocessor that runs software so we ask what if there is a third option instead of recycling or refurbishing the phone what if we could purpose it modify its hardware modified software a little bit so that it could replace some other electronic device okay decrease the amount of manufacturing we have and maybe be beneficial for the environment now why we even ask this question in the first place so i spend most of my time power consumption or actually my graduate students spend most of their time were worrying about the power consumption of what is behind me here this is an integrated circuit or computer chip and the reason we want to decrease the power consumption is to make you know electronics smaller and lighter make your battery last longer and these are all kind of important problems but actually we worked on this for a while we certainly had one of those sort of oh realizations right what if we reduced the power consumption of our chips so much that actually takes more energy to make the chip than the chip uses during its typical operating life okay so to answer this question we had my graduate student they do all the work john liver and my colleagues thank you touch area free thong and poland geyser we look into this several years ago and the results of our analysis are here so it turns out for the type of chip that you typically see in a mobile phone it takes 60 times more energy to make the chip in the first place than the chip uses joining typical two to three-year operating life okay now if you are worried about decreasing the power consumption of integrated circuits it is kind of a depressing result we are working on that tiny little sliver right and it takes all that big box to make the chip in the first place okay but instead of getting depressed i sort of realized that this is not really a fair comparison right that chip would not exist in the first place if we did not first invest the energy it takes to manufacture it that energy is what an economist would call a sunk cost cannot get it back and people get a lot of utility out of decreasing the power consumption of their chips right smaller electronics longer battery life so my students still work on that problem but we wanted to figure out if there a way we can get more return for that initial investment of manufacturing energy okay and we will the phone think about a phone instead of one chip there is usually six to ten chips like that so the investment of energy is that much higher at first we looked at you know can we just disassemble the phone take the chips out and use them again in other places and it turns out that may not make a lot of economic sense because of the time and labor involved in doing the disassembly process so instead of reusing the chips we thought about reusing the entire phone itself we tried to think about what kind of device could an old mobile phone completely replace in terms of its functionality okay and the parking tag the one we looked at replacing is the one on the left here this little thing is an electronic parking tag it is a really simple device what you do is you take your phone or credit card and you charge it up with minutes then when you park your car in a metered spot you paying this tag out or put it on the dashboard it starts off a little countdown timer with a display and then when the parking attendant comes by they look to see if your time is expired and you get a ticket or you do not or whatever yeah it is a really simple functionality so instead of building a new specific device to do this i had my student frank maker create that prototype on the right it is using an old noria no i phone he wrote a little ape that basically does all the functions of the electronic parking tag and you will know so you will notice it also has something extra it is got this little solar panel attached to this side okay with some electronics on a prototyping board to convert the solar panel voltage to something the phone likes why is that there well i am sure you all know what is the first thing to go bad on your mobile phone it is battery and if you want are thinking about purposing your mobile phone to do something else you may want to think about replacing that battery with a different kind of power supply okay so here's a picture of that prototype being used as an electronic parking tag on the dashboard of a frank's car in the inset you can see little screenshot from his ape it all works just fine it does not look very pretty i grant you that but on the other hand it is pretty obvious that you can easily optimize the hardware the software the packaging to make it look good and make it look like something you would be happy to have on the dashboard of your car but the question is now that we went to all this trouble of purposing this old phone and we actually done anything to benefit the environment and to do that we worked with some folks who are experts in what is called industrial ecology to do a lifecycle analysis and to see what the global impacts for the environment are of doing this purposing tremor's in from the university of californium manta barber helped us with this and here's the results of his study or our study so it turns out that this example for example you are looking at global warming if you purpose the electronic purpose the phone is electronic parking tag you can result in a net decrease in global warming whereas if you simply refurbish the phone and use it again as a phone it actually contributes to an increase in global warming okay once you account for all of the different impacts of components and so on and we looked at two options so the two bars on the top one corresponds to using the phone as a parking tag with solar panel the other two using it as a parking tag with a battery and both those options are better than refurbishing which you would expect but it turns out that using it with a battery is actually better than using it with a solar panel now why is that the reason is because you have to account for the energy it took to make the solar panel if that solar panel had been reclaimed from another product or another waste stream then the results of analysis would flip it would make more sense to use the purposed phone with the solar panel than the battery now this is a kind of a really important point whenever we are thinking about the environmental impact of our industrial production like with electronics the context is everything so for example the size of those bars the contribution to global warming does not just depend on what you are doing with that phone or with that purposed phone it depends on where the charger is plugged in so for example your phone is running off a battery as a parking tag if you plug that phone in and recharge it in californium where a lot of our grid electricity comes from renewal sources that contributes a lot less to global warming than if you took the same parking tag and plugged it in somewhere like china where a lot of the electricity comes from coal fired power plants say and in fact what may matter more even than what you do with that phone or that purpose phone is actually what you do with the charger so let us say you have got your phone purposed as a parking tag you are gonna charge it up before you go to campus and then put it on your dashboard if you leave the charger plugged in you take your phone out hmm go to campus but that charger does is it takes energy from the grid and transfer it to the battery of the phone okay but it takes a little bit for itself every time it does that and when you disconnect the phone from the charger that charger does not stop taking energy for itself it is still going to use some energy from the grid and if you leave that charger plugged in for about say 20% of the time you are using that purposed phone as a parking tag the charger is taking more energy that is transferring to the phone context so where do we go from here we have looked at purposing a mobile phone to do other do the tasks of other electronic devices it looks like it is going to help the environment in some ways how do we think about making that happen or making it easier well for inspiration we can look at this again mm-hmm no joke this is my daughter's big-girl bed okay she is almost five you might not be able to tell she kind of likes hello kitty but the reason i just want to show this is because this bed used to be her crib her baby crib you can see that the headboard and the footboard with sides of the crib now the company that designed and manufactured the crib did it in such a way that the consumer could basically take the crib apart which is some fallen wrenches and i sold a conversion kit that let us take that crib and scale it up to a full-size bed okay means one less bed has to be manufactured and in terms of impact on the environment we would expect that to be again on that win so the folks who designed mobile phones and other electronics they ought to be thinking like the folks who design baby cribs and building the phones and designing them in such a way that makes it easy either for the consumer or maybe for a business to convert the phones to another type of use and decreased environmental footprint of our electronics on our environment so the next time you upgrade your phone you have got to put that old phone in the drawers stop and ask yourself you know what did this old phone be now that i do not need it to be a phone anymore oh but first go home and unplug all your chargers thank you,rajeevan amirtharajah,a new life for mobile phones
"the story starts i was at a friend's house and she had on her shelf a copy of the dam manual which is the manual of mental disorders it lists every known mental disorder and it used to be back in the '50s, a very slim pamphlets and then it got bigger and bigger and bigger and now it is 886 pages long and it lists currently 374 mental disorders so i was leafing through it wondering if i had any mental disorders and it turns out i have got 12. laughter i have got generalized anxiety disorder which is a given i have got nightmare disorder which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure and all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street going you are a failure laughter i have got parent-child relational problems which i blame my parents for laughter i am kidding i am not kidding i am kidding and i have got malingering and i think it is actually quite rare to have both malingering and generalized anxiety disorder because malingering tends to make me feel very anxious anyway i was looking through this book wondering if i was much crazier than i thought i was or maybe it is not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder if you are not a trained professional or maybe the psychiatry profession has a kind of strange desire to label what is essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder i did not know which of these was true but i thought it was kind of interesting and i thought maybe i should meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view which is how i ended up having lunch with the scientologists. laughter it was a man called bring who runs a crack team of scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies they are called the ochre and i said to him can you prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudoscience that cannot be trusted and he said eyes we can prove it to you and i said ""how?"" and he said we are going to introduce you to tony and i said who is tony and he said story's in broadmoor."" now broadloom is broadloom hospital it used to be known as the broadloom asylum for the criminally insane it is where they send the serial killers and the people who cannot help themselves and i said to bring well what did tony do and he said hardly anything he beat someone up or something and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence but he faked it too well and now he is stuck in broadloom and nobody will believe he is sane do you want us to try and get you into broadloom to meet tony so i said eyes please so i got the train to broadmoor. i began to yawn uncontrollably around krypton park which apparently is what dogs also do when anxious they yawn uncontrollably and we got to broadmoor. and i got taken through gate after gate after gate after gate into the wellness center which is where you get to meet the patients it looks like a giant champion inn it is all peach and pine and calming colors and the only bold colors are the reds of the panic buttons and the patients started drifting in and they were quite overweight and wearing sweatpants and quite docile-looking. and brain the scientologist whispered to me they are medicated which to the scientologists, is like the worst evil in the world but i am thinking it is probably a good idea laughter and then brain said there is tony and a man was walking in and he was not overweight he was in very good physical shape and he was not wearing sweatpants he was wearing a pinstripe suit and he had his arm outstretched like someone out of the apprentice he looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me that he was very sane and he sat down and i said so is it true that you faked your way in here and he said yep yep absolutely i beat someone up when i was 17. and i was in prison awaiting trial and my cellmate said to me you know what you have to do fake madness tell them you are made you will get sent to some cushy hospital nurses will bring you pizzas you will have your own playstation.'"" i said well how did you do it he said well i asked to see the prison psychiatrist and i would just seen a film called 'crash,' in which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls so i said to the psychiatrist i get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls.'"" and i said what else he said oh yeah i told the psychiatrist that i wanted to watch women as they died because it would make me feel more normal i said where did you get that from he said oh from a biography of ted buddy that they had at the prison library anyway he faked madness too well he said and they did not send him to some cushy hospital they sent him to broadmoor. and the minute he got there said he took one look at the place asked to see the psychiatrist said there is been a terrible misunderstanding i am not mentally ill i said how long have you been here for he said well if i would just done my time in prison for the original crime i would have got five years i have been in broadloom for 12 years tony said that it is a lot harder to convince people you are sane than it is to convince them you are crazy he said i thought the best way to seem normal would be to talk to people normally about normal things like football or what is on the i subscribe to new scientists and recently they had an article about how the us army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives so i said to a nurse did you know that the us army is training bumblebees to sniff out explosives when i read my medical notes i saw they would written believes bees can sniff out explosives.'"" laughter he said you know they are always looking out for nonverbal clues to my mental state but how do you sit in a sane way how do you cross your legs in a sane way it is just impossible when tony said that to me i thought to myself am i sitting like a journalist am i crossing my legs like a journalist he said you know i have got the stockwell strangler on one side of me and i have got the tiptoe through the tulips rapist on the other side of me so i tend to stay in my room a lot because i find them quite frightening and they take that as a sign of madness they say it proves that i am aloof and grandiose so only in broadloom would not wanting to hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness anyway he seemed completely normal to me but what did i know and when i got home i emailed his clinician anchovy made i said what is the story and he said yep we accept that tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence because his hallucinations i that had seemed quite cloche to begin with i just vanished the minute he got to broadmoor. however we have assessed him and we have determined that what he is is a psychopath and in fact faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath it is on the checklist cunning manipulative so faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain has gone wrong and i spoke to other experts and they said the pinstripe suit i classic psychopath i speaks to items one and two on the checklist glibness superficial charm and grandiose sense of self-worth. and i said well but why did not he hang out with the other patients classic psychopath i it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy so all the things that had seemed most normal about tony was evidence according to his clinician that he was mad in this new way he was a psychopath and his clinician said to me if you want to know more about psychopaths you can go on a psychopath-spotting course run by robot hare who invented the psychopath checklist so i did i went on a psychopath-spotting course and i am now a certified i and i have to say extremely adept i psychopath spotter so here's the statistics one in a hundred regular people is a psychopath so there is 1,500 people in his room fifteen of you are psychopaths although that figure rises to four percent of coos and business leaders so i think there is a very good chance there is about 30 or 40 psychopaths in this room it could be carnage by the end of the night laughter hare said the reason why is because capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior i the lack of empathy the glibness cunning manipulative in fact capitalism perhaps at its most remorseless is a physical manifestation of psychopathy it is like a form of psychopathy that is come down to affect us all hare said you know what forget about some guy at broadloom who may or may not have faked madness who cares that is not a big story the big story he said is corporate psychopathy you want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths so i gave it a try i wrote to the enrol people i said could i come and interview you in prison to find out it you are psychopaths laughter and they did not reply laughter so i changed tack i emailed chainsaw all dunlap, the asset stripper from the 1990s. he would come into failing businesses and close down 30 percent of the workforce just turn america towns into ghost towns and i emailed him and i said i believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you ... special and interested in the predatory spirit and fearless can i come and interview you about your special brain anomaly and he said come on over laughter so i went to a burlap's grand florid mansion it was filled with sculptures of predatory animals there were lions and tigers i he was taking me through the garden i there were falcons and eagles he was saying over there you have got sharks and --"" he was saying this in a less effeminate way i you have got more sharks and you have got tigers it was like narial laughter and then we went into his kitchen now a burlap would be brought in to save failing companies he would close down 30 percent of the workforce and he would quite often fire people with a joke like for instance one famous story about him somebody came up to him and said i have just bought myself a new care and he said well you may have a new care but i will tell you what you do not have i a job so in his kitchen i he was in there with his wife judge and his bodyguard mean i and i said you know how i said in my email that you might have a special brain anomaly that makes you special he said yeah it is an amazing theory it is like star trek you are going where no man has gone before and i said well --"" clears throat laughter some psychologists might say that this makes you --"" mumbles laughter and he said ""what?"" and i said a psychopath and i said i have got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket can i go through them with you and he looked intrigued despite himself and he said okay go on and i said okay grandiose sense of self-worth."" which i have to say would have been hard for him to deny because he was standing under a giant oil painting of himself laughter he said well you have got to believe in you and i said ""manipulative."" he said that is leadership laughter and i said shallow affect an inability to experience a range of emotions he said who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions so he was going down the psychopath checklist basically turning it into who moved my cheese laughter but i did notice something happening to me the day i was with a dunlap. whenever he said anything to me that was kind of normal i like he said not to juvenile delinquency he said he got accepted into west point and they do not let delinquents in west point he said not to many short-term marital relationships he is only ever been married twice admittedly his first wife cited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like but people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages in the heat of an argument and his second marriage has lasted 41 years so whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of non-psychopathic, i thought to myself well i am not going to put that in my book and then i realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had kind of turned me a little bit psychopathic because i was desperate to shove him in a box marked ""psychopath."" i was desperate to define him by his maddest edges and i realized my god i this is what i have been doing for 20 years it is what all journalists do we travel across the world with our notepads in our hands and we wait for the gems and the gems are always the outermost aspects of our interviewee's personality and we stitch them together like medieval monks and we leave the normal stuff on the floor and you know this is a country that over-diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely childhood bipolar i children as young as four are being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums which scores them high on the bipolar checklist when i got back to condone tony phoned me he said why have not you been returning my calls i said well they say that you are a psychopath and he said i am not a psychopath he said you know what one of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse but another item on the checklist is cunning manipulative so when you say you feel remorse for your crime they say typical of the psychopath to cunningly say he feels remorse when he does not it is like witchcraft they turn everything upside-down."" he said i have got a tribunal coming up will you come to it so i said okay so i went to his tribunal and after 14 years in broadmoor, they let him got they decided that he should not be held indefinitely because he scores high on a checklist that might mean that he would have a greater than average chance of recidivism so they let him got and outside in the corridor he said to me you know what on everyone's a bit psychopathic he said you are i am well obviously i am i said what are you going to do now he said i am going to go to belgium there is a woman there that i fancy but she is married so i am going to have to get her split up from her husband laughter anyway that was two years ago and that is where my book ended and for the last 20 months everything was fine nothing bad happened he was living with a girl outside condone he was according to brain the scientologist, making up for lost time which i know sounds ominous but is not necessarily ominous unfortunately after 20 months he did go back to jail for a months he got into a fracas in a bar he called it ended up going to jail for a months which i know is bad but at least a month implies that whatever the fracas was it was not too bad and then he phoned me and you know what i think it is right that tony is out because you should not define people by their maddest edges and what tony is is he is a semi-psychopath. he is a gray area in a world that does not like gray areas but the gray areas are where you find the complexity it is where you find the humanity and it is where you find the truth and tony said to me ""jon, could i buy you a drink in a bar i just want to thank you for everything you have done for me and i did not got what would you have done thank you",on reason,strange answer to the psychopath
i am a pediatrician a researcher and a parent and i became those things in that order and the reason the sequencing is important is because even though i was a doctor who took care of children for a while and i was a researcher who studied ways to keep them healthy it was not until i became a parent that i got interested in some might even say obsessed with early learning it was 14 years ago when my son was born and i took a month paternity leave to be with him in his third month of life and now in retrospect as a pediatrician i should have known better because i opted for the time when colic crescendos and i spent that month with him in a snuggle bouncing on a big blue ball and watching more daytime television than i have in my life and noticed that he was actually interested in it as much as i like to believe that my two-month-old was following can as closely as i was it was obvious to me that he was not and yet something about that experience was important to him early experiences matter now why do these early experiences matter the typical newborn brain is 333 grams and in the first two years of life it actually triples in size it is an extraordinary period of brain growth unparalleled over the life course and you can see that here is both brain growth over the lifespan and you can see how steep the rise is early on and it continues to grow until about age 20 and i will let you guys in the audience find yourselves over on the right there and see why you had such a hard time finding your car keys this morning now we are actually born with a lifetime supply of brain cells or neurons that is not what actually grows it is the connections between those brain cells what we call synapses that account for that brain growth and those synapses form based on early experiences if you will the mind is fine-tuned to the world that babies inhabit and to give you an example of that that you can all relate to any child born anywhere in the world can learn to speak any language fluently but if she is not exposed to certain sounds early in the first few years of her life she can learn to speak another language later but she will never sound like a native speaker so a baby born today in mainland china as amazing as it is can learn to speak fluent mandarin but if she does not hear english sounds early in her life she can learn to speak english later but as we all know we know such people she will struggle making certain sounds it was not because she was not born with that capacity it was because her early experience did not condition her mind to learn them now this graphic actually shows just that what you see is the brain and you see the neurons and the synapses connecting them we are born with about 2 500 synapses by age three we have 15 000. and then over time those connections are actually pruned in response to uh the external stimulation the external world that we live in now to give you another example of that this is the breathing pattern of a one day old infant listening to music and you can see here that he is listening to moat and then stravinsky is put on and then moat again now i show you this not to present some kind of an infantile critique of classical music but and those of you in the audience who are classic music aficionados might have a hypothesis about why stravinsky did this to his breathing pattern but the point is the point is that even at one day of life there is a discernible physiological reaction to what babies are actually hearing pet scans now we know from decades of research that too little stimulation early on is bad for brain development i show you here two pet scans now pet scans are measures of brain function the brighter colors show more brain activity and on the left is a pet scan of a normal kindergartener and on the right is a pet scan of a child who is raised in a horribly neglected environment this is actually a pet scan from a child who is raised in a romania orphanage and was profoundly neglected early in life and you will notice that there are areas of his brain that show no activity at all it did not develop as a result of too little stimulation now this is a horrific example of too little stimulation and the untoward consequences of it but the question we have had in our lab for some time is what about too much is it actually possible to over stimulate the developing brain or more appropriately to inappropriately stimulate the developing brain in ways that are actually not beneficial but harmful too much and this is important because we are technologizing childhood today in a way that is unprecedented in 1970 the average age at which children began to watch television regularly was four years like this cute little girl here and today based on research that we have done it is four months it is not just how orally they watch but how much they watch the typical child before the age of five is watching about four and a half hours of to a day that represents as much as 40 percent of their waking hours which brings us to baby einstein many of you probably have not seen baby einstein but i will show you a random 20 second clip from baby einstein day on the farm and here it is next one in that 20-second clip there were seven scene changes about one every three seconds it is about the most exhausting day on the farm since john steinbeck's grapes of wrath and of course it is nothing like being on a real farm right adults watching this find it discombobulating because your mind is trying to make a coherent narrative out of this and there is no coherent narrative it jumps all over the place but babies are not trying to make a coherent narrative out of it they are not capable of doing that it is all of that screen change all of that stimulation that is keeping them actually engaged in the screen overstimulation hypothesis so we have had for a while what we call the overstimulation hypothesis which is that prolonged exposure to this rapid image change during this critical window of brain development would precondition the mind to expect high levels of input and that would lead to inattention in later life so you watch enough baby einstein day on the farm as a baby and when you go to a farm as a school-aged child it is boring it is too slow how come there is no sheep suddenly popping into my face how come there is no marionette going back and forth why do i have to walk from here to there that is the general idea that you are conditioning the mind to that reality which does not actually exist results and we we tested this uh some years ago and what we found was that the more television children watch before age three the more likely they were to actually have attentional problems at school age specifically for each hour that they watch before the age of three their chances of having attentional problems was increased by about 10 percent so a child who watched two hours of to a day before the age of three would be 20 percent more likely to have attention problems compared to a child who watched none now what else did we find we found that the more cognitive stimulation children uh received and we measured cognitive stimulation in terms of how often parents read to their child how often they took them to the museum how often they sang to them we found that cognitive stimulation reduced the chances of attentional problems later in life in fact each hour of cognitive stimulation reduced them by about 30 percent so if you will these are two sides of the same coin there is certain things that we can do early on in our children lives that enhance their ability to pay attention and certain things that we can do early on that actually impede them now if our hypothesis was right that it is based on the pacing of the programs and you might imagine that what children watch actually is important and so content would be key and i will give you two examples of content to illustrate that point the first is the powerpuff girls movie the right mix of sugar and spice for satisfying rush i do not know how many of you have seen that but here's a scene from that okay so that was again you can see a lot of rapid sequencing in fact this was the first movie that was ever rated pig for nonstop frenetic animated action i am not i am not making it up that is the back of the box there now i want to contrast that with something that i am sure you are all very familiar with uh really needs no introduction but this is a clip from my rogers for you to watch hi oh hi there i am fine how are you good thanks i brought my television neighbor to see what a restaurant was like oh i am so glad can i show you to a table certainly i am awfully busy today one of the waitresses is ill i see so i am sort of doing double duty how about this this is fine thank you very much sit down and i will be right back all right now when you come to a restaurant usually somebody shows you what table you are supposed to sit at and uh one of the first things you do is to put your napkin either on your lap or up here and then well this is the way a table is set so free rogers invented reality to he is not credited with it actually it is not reality right it is even slower paced than reality uh the waitress says i am awfully busy but she does not seem the least bit hurried so you can see that they are very very real differences in pacing and when we followed up our study with a subsequent experiment to look at what children actually watch what you see is that educational programs like my rogers pose no increased risk of attentional problems entertainment programs like the powerpuff girls movie increased the chances by about 60 percent and violent programming which i did not show you increases it even by more than 100 and violent programs are typically even more rapidly sequenced mouse to now in the last year we have been building actually a mouse model of television viewing in my lab and you are now watching mouse to here uh the sounds are from the cartoon network and the lights are uh basically photorhythmically generated by those sounds this is what it looks like these are the to lounges here that the mice live in and they have speakers above and lights around them and what we do is we start about 10 days of life and these mice watch to six hours a day for 42 days it is basically their entire childhood spent in front of a television which is not uncommon these days for some children even and then 10 days later we actually assess their behavior in a few ways i want to show with you the first test we do measures their activity and risk taking now we do what is called the open field test now mice have two kind of competing instincts you will see them here one is to avoid being in the middle of anything because of course mice have very few friends and being in the middle of this open field is risky but of course they have a competing interest uh instinct to forage for food so at some point they do need to go into the middle and explore their environment now we put these mice in here and test them and we exploit the fact that it is a white mouse on a black background and with the computer above we can actually track their movement and you can see on the left is sort of a normal mouse spending most of its time around the perimeter but look at the one on the right notice how much time it spends in the middle but also notice just how much general activity this mouse is actually exhibiting so this is both a hyperactive and a risk-taking mouse and when we look at our are over stimulated compared to our control mice we find that the overstimulated might spend more time in the center and they enter the center more than the regular mice do the next test we do is what is called the novel object recognition and this tests short-term memory and learning we put a mouse in it in a box with two objects and the mouse will explore both of them get to know them if you will and then we take the mouse out and an hour later we have replaced one object with a novel object and we see how much time the mouse spends on each object now the mouse that is learning that has good short-term memory will spend more time on the novel object and you can see that here as opposed to the one on the right which is spending the same amount of time with both objects and what did we find well we found that our control mice our normal mice spent 75 percent of their time with a novel object but look at what our to viewing or over stimulated mice did they spent the exact same amount of time it was as if they could not distinguish the two objects or they did not care but one way or another they were not learning they were not acting like normal mice i want us to talk a little bit about a study we did with children it is a building block study it was a randomized trial here in a low-income clinic in settle we took 200 children who were 18 to 24 months of age and we gave half of them blocks at the beginning of the study and half of them blocks at the end and their parents got what we call blocktivities monthly these were ways to play with your children with blocks sort the blocks stack the blocks count the blocks really simple things that come naturally to a lot of parents but what a lot of low-income parents do not do with their children regularly and here's what here's what happened the children who got the blocks 59 percent of them played with them on a typical day as opposed to 13 percent who did not get the blocks initially they played for about 20 minutes a day about one and a half episodes a day and about 65 percent of the time was with their parent and then six months later we assessed their language and see on the right here that the kids who got the blocks late scored in the and percentile which is below average but unfortunately not uncommon in low-income populations in settle and for that matter around the world and the kids who got the blocks they actually scored a 56 percentile significantly better and slightly above average so promoting that kind of interactive play actually promoted language development in these young children conclusion so i want to conclude by impressing on you that early childhood is very important for children and for mice and it is critical to their development and we need more mealtime play today and less fast-paced media particularly for young children it is vitally important that we have that because if we change the beginning of the story we change the whole story thank you very very much you,dimetric christakis,media and children
my name is sign tank dasgupta i am a medical humanities educator and a writer and the idea that i want to share with you today is a philosophy of listening that i have been calling narrative humility but before i get started let me ask you all a question when was listening the last time you felt truly listened to not just heard while somebody was testing but deeply attended to and i want you to grab hold of that memory and kind of hold it within yourself for a moment because that sort of relational moment that is sort of being seen and being heard and being made to understand that we matter in this world that is one of our fundamental human needs and so let me ask you a followup question it is this when you are being listened to how did you know what were the behaviors of listening the eye contact or the touching that let you know that your listener was right there with you and not thinking about his groceries or something and i think that if i were to take a survey of everyone here i might get as different answers as there are people here because listening is not a one-size-fits-all activity right listening is not simply ten seconds of touching or eye contact it is nothing less than tapping into our innermost humanity and making that humanity present such that we might witness the humanity of another and so if listening is not a one-size-fits-all activity we get to the crux of my professional life which is okay then how do you teach it teaching because that is my job as a professor in the program and narrative medicine at colombia university and as a faculty member here the health advocacy program saran clarence college i teach healthcare professionals how to listen to stories because if being listened to is one of our fundamental human needs it is exponentially so in moments of illness crisis trauma in fact we often call stories the little boats that help us navigate the treacherous waters as we make our way from as sudan song would say the kingdom of the well to the kingdom of the sick and hopefully back again and those stories need listeners they need witnesses of course nothing i am saying is particularly new in ye olden days before doctors had anything of interest in their black bags right no iris or fancy lab tests what we had was the ability to show up what we had was the ability to listen to attend to somebody's birth life death everything in between but what is happened with the increasing technological skills necessary to modern medicine right reading iris interpreting lab tests is that we have pushed that first relational storied heart of medicine to the wayside and so what my colleagues in medical humanities and i are suggesting is that we hold on equal stead those two ways of knowing a scientific way of knowledge construction in a storied way it is just as important to be able to read interpret a radiograph an pray and read or interpret a patient's story easier said than done however in our modern age why because as we all know we are being inundated with information simultaneous narratives that we have to process all the time right we are in the midst of a cultural crisis of story a cultural crisis of listening so much so that brown university neuroscientist set horowitz has been writing about the fact that we are losing our higher-order listening functions in order in other words that ability to tune out what is unimportant and tune in one person one narrative one story in all of its twists and turns and unexpected happenings in fact there is this rich field of attention studies this is a cat scan of along with some nodules in it and some researchers showed it to hazard university radiologists folks who are used to seeing stuff like this and they were asked what is wrong with this picture even when they were told can you find the gorillas in this image 85% of hazard university radiologists did not see it and neither did i when i was reading about this study that in fact there is a you know little gorilla man up there in the upper left hand corner and this is but one of a series of such gorillas in the picture studies and it seems unbelievable right how can you not see the gorilla in the picture but i think it speaks to this crisis of story it speaks to this idea that we see what we expect to see we hear the story we expect to hear and this is actually really critical in medicine that we open ourselves up to stories in such a way that we are open to seeing the gorilla in the picture why just because it is nice or it might give us a more satisfying professional life which it will but because opening ourselves up to stories listening to stories deeply makes us do our job better in medicine not just that but perhaps more cost-effectively perhaps we might deliver a more just medicine so if i am open to stories but i might know that this elderly woman that i am seeing is an avid gardener and i might realize that she is using a new pesticide this year and that the syndrome of symptoms that i am seeing are actually secondary to some kind of pesticide contamination and not some exotic disease disease that i am about to spend thousands of dollars testing for a real story i was once treating a little girl for an ear infection a simple ear infection was not getting better and so i curled the mom into the office i was sure she was doing something and i said madam can you show me how you are giving this medicine okay doc and she drew up you know in a syringe the right amount of medicine the five it is or whatever it was of the amoxicillin and she says well three times a day doc i draw it up and i administer the medicine she calls up to her ear this is of course an oral antibiotic and it was sheer arrogance on my part that i had not made that explicit and you know what are your infection you put the medicine in there like it makes sense right uh but i think that this was not so much of me being open to gorillas as it was a gorilla like hitting me over the head but certainly it made me do my job better okay so you say oh opening ourselves up to stories is so important surely they are teaching that in medical school yeah no not so much um when i went to hoping medical school a wonderful place to be from when you first walk in the first thing you see is this giant statue of jess on a pedestal kind of hearing over you and somehow you start getting the message that you two are expected to somehow be godlike in your medical practice peering over people you are told things like you are the best of the best and you are walking in the footsteps of giants and as you are being kind of fed this culture of hierarchy and medicine you are also systematically having your own humanity stripped from you it was very clear to us that the work patient care came first before going to the bathroom sleeping eating taking care of your own family and while this may seem like a good idea like sure i want a doctor who thinks about me before they think about going to the bathroom right we have to think at what cost at what cost and i think part of the cost is this culture of hierarchy and part of the cost is this stripping of humanity from people who are in fact tasked with listening to you in the most humane way possible how are we equipping them to do that in fact in medical school we tend to have this strange bifurcated view of listening we tend to think of well listening is something ineffable it is something magical you either are born with it or you do not have it and hey if you are a bad listener then we will just shuffle you off to the lab or make sure you go into a subspecialty where you do not have to take care of patients too much so either we think about it that way or we tend to think of listening as a checklist we are told things like you know the studies show that if you sit at the bedside those doctors actually get sued less so when you go into a patient's room sit down and meet their eye for ten seconds and when they stop then pause for a couple of beats and repeat back the last three things they said to you so that they know you were listening now look i have nothing against sitting at the bedside or repeating what somebody said but to me this is not really listening this is just enacting listening this is kind of faking it till you make it and to me there is just no excuse for faking your humanity when you are tasked with assisting somebody in their most dire moment there is no excuse for faking your humanity at those moments and so i was delighted when i came out of training i found colleagues who also felt the same way colleagues who are thinking about things like narrative competence which is essentially the skill set to elicit interpret and act upon a patient's story the idea is that we would never graduate somebody from medical or nursing or therapy school who was not competent in their anatomy or their physiology right why would we graduate somebody who was not competent in dealing with a patient's story so over the years i have actually started to think about this idea of competence and challenged it a little bit because while this is good to me it still has a little bit of that hierarchy right that on a pedestal thing and parve because when i was in medical school i would be given these courses in cultural competency and i would be given a list of 10 things that dominican america believe or 10 things that southeast signs do and i be told you know outta when somebody says shit they mean this right so memorize this list and then you will be competent in dealing with this community not only is that troubling you cut it is really reductionist but as a woman of color trainee here i was being told how to deal with these other patients when boy those other patients looked a lot like me right and so i was really intrigued when i read some educators who suggested that we will maybe instead of cultural competence thinking about the other we should think about cultural humility train people to think about themselves their own prejudices and expectations and orientations towards stories so i thought well okay cultural humility but that seems to be something that you only do when those other people come into your office whatever that means what if we started thinking about narrative humility the fact that every human being has some aspect of the unknowable every story might have a gorilla waiting around the corner right so narrative humility is that sense of humility towards that which we do not know the face of the other the face we cannot know but to which we are responsible okay all old good narrative humility i am trying to sell it to my medical colleagues and they are not buying it why because humility is not sexy at least in humility this country the way we understand it now we tend to think of humility is solely the purview of somebody very very spiritual yeah or solely the purview of somebody very very passive right the guy who cannot take the football and if there is anything we like to do in medicine we like to kick the football right we like to live in the active verb we suture and deride and in size and diagnosed we do not like to think of ourselves receiving and opening up and witnessing so what i am asking for here is nothing less than a real cultural change than a revolution in the way we think about ourselves and think about humility that in fact humility is powerful humility can help overthrow the most powerful empire in the world right that in fact humility is a necessary adjunct is a necessary partner of action you only have to think of the heart which must feel up with blood before it can pump out again the lungs which must inhale before we can exhale to realize that listening and action are necessary partners in medicine and so back to my original question which was can teaching listening listening be taught yes a resounding yes it is what i do every single day i teach listening by having my students read stories like nancy meters who is a memoirist who writes about having ms and using a wheelchair and she says that when she started publishing people started coming out of the woodwork they would send her these emails and letters me too me too she says it is as though the parts we were all singing that we thought were solos turned out to be a chorus only none of us was singing loud enough for the others to hear so we see here that telling and listening become an antidote to isolation a call for community i also teach listening by having my students write their own personal stories their own embodied stories of illness one young woman a medical student who also had ms publish this beautiful essay but she published it ultimately under a pseudonym because she felt like there was such a punishment in medical culture for any sign of weakness right any doctor whose enlist you cannot talk about it and yet at the end of her essay she had the most beautiful advice for her colleagues she said do not stand by the foot of the bed and tower over your patient she feels small already take a minute sit down listen try to understand realize that you will never understand try anyway narrative humility right realize you will never understand try anyway and finally i teach listening by having my students actually witnessed stories do oral histories one of the most moving oral histories was here at saran clarence a student of mine named marries brogan she asked me to use her name came to me and said science view a real of mine who has late-stage all and he cannot speak anymore can i interview him i said well how are you gonna engage in this listening exercise with somebody who cannot speak she said trust me and i did and it was one of the most moving stories i have ever had the opportunity to witness she showed us this video of her relative case who was sitting in his wheelchair with you know his breathing apparatus and all of his accoutrement and she would ask him a question and he would start to answer with his left hand writing it down when he grew tired she would come in and write you know finish writing the sentence and say is that what you meant by god and in this way together together in that relational space they to constructed his story and so she wrote about it the interaction is central and what he is writing is secondary he is having his say and i am the instrument that is giving voice to his thoughts right what a beautiful model for that relational space in healthcare so finally i just want to say that teaching listening has been the most humbling and moving experience for me over the years bell hooks writes that education can be a practice of freedom education that connects the will to know with the will to become and that learning is a place where paradise can be created and so i would like to suggest that a healthcare that is practiced from a stance of narrative humility a place that connects the will to know with the will to become that creates a situation such that listening is a place where paradise can be created thank you very much,sayantani dasgupta,narrative humility
i have this part of the question how many of you know what a spoiler alert okay well let me let me explain them for people to go if you are reading a review of a movie or a book or something and you see the word spoiler it means that the review is about to give away the ending or give away some important plot twists and if you keep reading room so here's my spoiler i am about to give away the ending of pretty much every movie ever made and so if you have not seemed pretty much every movie ever made i apologize now because i am about to ruin it for last summer i was asked to speak at the second world commerce in the international partners i called her association which makes no sense because i am not a psychologist i am a movie producer and as recently as two years ago i would never even heard of positive psychology but one year ago i read a book called flourish by dry marcel and in that book he named what he calls the five elements of well-being so i would like to give those to you now and write them down if you like it is only eight words i am not a big slide person so it is write them down then later look at them that is as close to a slide as you are going to get out so here they are the five elements of wealthy number one the first three you just heard when i saw him talk number one positive emotions number two engagement number three and then since then that that talk was from 2008 he is adding two more positive relationships and positive accomplishments so to it mulligan and his colleagues in positive psychology these are the five elements well being more of these things you have a new lives but more likely you are happy and optimistic and resilient but when i first saw this list not knowing what it was i did not know it was the five elements of well-being i thought it was the five qualities of a good move i think that positive impressions engagement meaning positive relationships and positive accomplishments and like i have interested in the idea is there a correlation between the five things that make life worth living and the five games that make movies worth watch and since our topic today is together or the word together i thought i would focus just on those last two positive relationships and positive accomplishments because i think when you look at those two elements of well-being through the lens of popular movies you begin to get some sense of how we feel about them and how much we value them and whether we value one over the other so the question becomes this which matters will saving the world or kissing the girl so let us start with positive comments because that is the easy one everybody needs see that there is a relationship between movie and movies and accomplishments we are america we love winners we like people who are top the image of somebody jumping up and down at the end of a film celebrating some victory i think as a fairly instinctive and i thought i would write down three examples of movies that ended positive in commons there were thousands to choose from but the three i happen to write down when i was first thinking about this work when jennies grey makes the scary dance leap into packing swathe is arms at the end of dirty dancing when the karate kid makes the impossible kick that wipes out his opponent and when king gorge the sixth finally gets through his wartime speech without stammering to me these accomplishments are among the great pleasures of the cinema but then i sat down with a man who runs an audience research from one of those companies that oversees will be brief because i wanted to know you i want to show him that listened to see if he thought there was correlation between the list and movies the preview really well and he looked at the list and in about two seconds he said i can tell you one thing right now audiences do not care a lot of college and i said what and he said audiences do not care about accomplishments what they care about is the moment afterwards when the accomplishment is shared with the person the hero loves so i went i went back to my list and i looked at them and i went wow dirty dancing does not with a leaf it ends with a scene in which jennies grey reconciles with her father who is the most important person in her life when he says how beautiful she looked while she was dancing and the grunting kid does not have a kick if you see the more recent version and you see it over and over again on multiple screens but after that he reconciles with his opponent and then he shares his victory with his mother and his trainer the last thing you see in the king's speech is not the speech it is a car white letters on a black background that says line and bird remained friends for the rest of their lives line maiden speech therapist and bedtime being the nickname for the key and the movie did not always end that way it turns out you can forgive them for thinking they were making a movie by speech it is called the king speaking after all and that speech is one of the most important moments in brutish wartime history but they wanted more than that um and they have those seeds in which he reconciles with his i mean he is not reckon cells but he shares his victory speech therapist with his family but the audience wanted even more than that they want make sure that that friendship that they have been watching develop over the course of that movie was a real friendship it was not just a powerful man using another man for his own devices that it was a real friendship and it went on forever so what i began to realize was it in movie turns over and over again positive relationships trumped positive accomplishments almost every time and there is some interesting corollaries to this for example we forget how these movies in a lot of the time and the perfect example is a woman i know whose favorite movie in the whole world is dirty dancing she is probably seen in a hundred and fifty times and she is a studio executive and we can set our watches when we are in meetings with her how long goes by before she will say you know what this c reminds me um it reminds me of that scene and dirty dancing where trick sway and then we start to laugh and then she starts to laugh and says what am i supposed to do it is my favorite movie ever so i called her up and i said something what is the last thing that happens in dirty days she said the leap and i said really acting all superior ism um and she said yeah well you know this jennies grey runs down the aisle and she leaps into trick swathe is arms and he holds her up with the air like an airplane and then he put her down then they started to dance and then the movies oh and i said when does she reconcile with her father she said well before me so i came over and whatever to her office and i brought the film with me and i show her the last 10 minutes of the movie and she could not believe it and what we realized was all this emotion that comes from the end of that movie that we were associating would that leave a week she was afraid to make a beginning of the movie it now has the courage to make at the end of the movie it was not coming from the account it was coming from the relationship and the other thing that is interesting is that when we make movies for men and boys when we make movies for general audiences which a lot of time is men and there is a structure that occurs again and again and again not living but in a lot of those movies and here's the years how it works there is the hero who is usually a man there is the accomplishment the goal that he has set himself to accomplish and then there is the relationship you get the accomplished whenever relationship because there is a primary relationship with a woman or his father or a child or with the best friend so here's how it goes he sets himself towards this relationship i mean the towards this accomplishment and he works really hard to get there and it is all kinds of obstacles he has to overcome and then there is a terrible set of actors before the end and then he gets there any cheese's achievement and then he realizes it does not mean anything without the relationship and then there is a scene about the relationship okay when we make movies for women not all the time much of the time the accomplishment is the goal is love and everything that is going on in the movie is about whether those two people that the movie is about get together at the end or not and it does not matter if it is the notebook or nothing hill or bridesmaids or the bow that is what is going on now some people say that is patronizing to women and some people say that is sending two women and some people say that is hollywood's way of keeping women in their place but maybe what it really means figured it out women do not need a whole movie to teach them then relationships are more bars of an accomplishments they knew that when they buy their ticket so you have been just dispense with all that saving the world stuff because they want to get right to the good stuff and the good stuff it is the relationship now by this point i got to know more yourself and i called him up and i said tell me something if you put that list five elements well being in front of men and women do they react to it differently and he said yeah in general men will tell you that accomplishments are the most important thing and women will tell you it is relationships okay but think about this we tried really hard in a movie business to end our movies at the moment of peak audience satisfaction so if men really value accomplishments more than relationships would not we end missile bounces off the transamerica building instead of with a senior four people at a table would not we end transformers dark of the moon when the autobus defeat the deceptions instead of a scene where the guy says to the girl you are the only thing in this world that i need would not we end the final harry potter movie when harry pills baltimore you have been trying to kill baltimore for seven volts and eight and if you look at the trailer for that last harry potter movie you would swear that is the only thing going on in the movie is whether or not he is going to kill voldemort but the end the movie where he kills baltimore no we ended years later when he is grown up at a train station with his wife and his children as friends so maybe what is going on here when we make movies for men and boys is a giant bait and switch we say here's a moan about saving the world here's a movie about a giant alien robots here's a movie about killing the evil wizard but what we deliver is a movie about really man and women the acknowledgment so you cannot really talk about accomplishments and relationships and movies without talking about rocky when i give this talk in smaller groups inevitably by this point someone will have interrupted me and said what about rave what about robbin everything you are talking about is rocky there is the accomplishment and there is a relationship he is an accomplishment that he shares with somebody looks he wins the fight that he says yo drain i did it so let us talk about rounds when i was in philadelphia last summer i had the chance to visit the famous rocky steps the ones that he runs up in and keep in mind this was during that terrible heat wave they were having a summer the heat index that particular day in philadelphia was a hundred and fifteen degrees and there were doctors on radio and on television banging people not to go outside let us say literally if you go outside and exercise today you will die so i took a taxi to the top of the rocky steps and i walked out on it is the philadelphia museum of art and i walked out onto the top and every five minutes there was somebody running the staff some wool 72 of them bottom to top getting to the top turning around jumping up down pumping their fists there picture taken and i began to realize that there was more one on there than just tourism because i would see people with tears pouring down their faces as they were running those steps and it turns out there is a wonderful quote called rocky stories in which a journalist interview people who ran the steps he spent a year interviewing those people and there is wonderful photographs and what he found was that people were coming from all over the world to celebrate some personal victory by imitating rookies so for example if you look at the book you will see there is two women who have been friends for 45 years or jumping up and down the top of the rocket steps to celebrate that long friendship and there is a man's had a heart transplant who is come all the way to philadelphia to run the steps to celebrate his recovery and then we employ will say if i could just get that girl to marry me i marry her on top of the rocky steps the day i was there three different weddings were waiting to go on at the same time hot tuxedos hot bridal gowns hot bridesmaids dresses and the thing is that movie came out 36 years ago and none of those people was older than 36 so it just shows you the power of the inspiration of that movie and how long it is lasted so rocky as most of you probably know is the story of a washed-up boxer who ends up going 15 rounds against the world heavyweight champion apollo creed it won the academy award for best picture it was a huge financial heads it is on the america film institute's list of the greatest america movies ever made it is actually number four on their list of the most of inspirational america movies ever made it has spawned five sequels so far and hundreds of imitators and almost every single one with sequels and imitators has copied that rocky formula that formula of the underdog who wins right down to the smallest detail except and the one but they almost never come is the fact that rocky did not win original rocky mcphee rocky does not win he does not say yo drain i did it because he did not do it he says at the end of rocky to where he does not in the fight and then he wins the fight rocky 3 and rocky for rocky five but in that first rocky movie the one that is number four on the america film institute's leather the most inspirational movies ever made rocky loses the fight talk about a movie what people do not remember how it ends talk about a movie where this power of a relationship overwhelms people's memory of everything that happened before them but i got interested in that list of the most inspirational movies ever made because what i began to notice is how many of those movies are about heroes who do not win how many of them do not get what they want for example give you some other examples from their top 10 inspiration gorge bailey in its wonderful life all he wants is to travel the world adding this finch in to kill a mockingbird has a client who is been falsely accused of a terrible crime and while he wants is for that man to be set free lie enlist wants et to be his friend forever the road family and its in the grace of rather come to californium seeking prosperity and none of them get what they want so what gives if there is no positive accomplished at the end of those movies and no victory to be celebrated afterwards then what makes these movies so inspiration why are people still jumping up and down on the rocky steps 36 years later if rocky lost a fight and i think the answer is that what is being celebrated at the ends of those movies is something else and it is not as enormous as saving the world and it is not quite as simple as kissing the girl what is being celebrated at the ends of those movies is the tenderness and the kindness and the comfort of each other at the end of it is a wonderful life when gorge bailey has returned from the death of despair the angel says to him no man is a failure who has friends at the end of et when elliott is heartbroken by the spaceship archer we know he will be comforted by the family that surrounds him at the end of tequila mockingbird when a series of terrible events have been succeeded by a series of beautiful attics finch his little daughter sums it all up by talking about the neighbors she says who bring food with death and flowers with sickness and the little things in between and at the end of the first rocky movie he does not say yo drain i did it and he does not even kiss her he just clutches her with all the strength he has left in his body while they say i love you over and over again you,lindy dora,saving the world vs kissing the girl
"imagine we have all been endowed with this gift of imagination and i am going to ask you to use your imagination to picture in your mind's eye a tiger i am gonna give you a little help tigers have colorful stripes for camouflage on average tigers grow to about 11 feet weighing more than 600 pounds of all cats that exist in the world today they have the longest canine teeth about two and a half inches long now i would like you to imagine that you have just come face-to-face with a very unhappy tiger what do you do are you fast enough to outrun the tiger i doubt it very much are you strong enough to out wrestle the tiger i doubt that - why did i ask you to think about a tiger well it could be because i teach at buffalo state and buffalo state college our mascot happens to be a began tiger but that is not it i could tell you that one of the most enjoyable reed's i have had in the last year was the life of pi which has been released as a major motion picture and if you are familiar with that then you know one of the characters in the book is a tiger but that is not it tigers first appeared two million years ago the homogeneous humans appeared two and a half million years ago think about it look at yourself how on earth did we ever survive given threats like that in our environment how is that possible here's one answer conformity psychological research done in the 1950s and is shows that humans have what is called a conformity bias we tend to do what other people do it is the way we are wired i will give you a visual demonstration of that a couture video of an old to program many of you probably will not remember it i remember from my childhood called candid camera the hidden camera if you are familiar with like disaster date to it is kind of like the precursor to disaster date so in this scene from candid camera there are three actors on an elevator facing the back of the elevator and then a fourth person comes in who unknowingly is being videoed he is not part of the program let us see what happens i would try it once again here's the candid subject it comes the candid camera staff three of them at least and this man has apparently been in group music applause so it makes you wonder when you see something like that how on earth did we survive well there is an evolutionary advantage to conformity in fact there are three the first is conformity allows for collaboration you want to take down a great big woolly mammoth get some friends it also helps in aiding with learning by observing others we can see them test ideas and then we take what is successful and we use those are elves and the third is it creates culture we have shared values and norms but if all we ever did was conform then we would not have growth we would never try anything new let me try this out with you physical analogy if you are holding something sharp please put it down and fold your arms in front of you as you would naturally note which forearm you have on top i have my left forearm on top when i asked you to put your arms together how did that feel comfortable right did you have to think about it probably not take your arms up this time and weave them together so the opposite forearm ends up on top some of you are trying to figure it out same arms the first time you folded your arms that is what conformity feels like it is comfortable and you do not have to think you just follow but if that is all you ever did you would never grow eventually because conditions change we have to try new things conformity has been talked about in terms of its role in evolution but i want to suggest to you today that there is another part of that equation and that is creativity so while conformity is necessary for evolution i would suggest that it is not sufficient that it also requires creativity and let me see if i can make a case by looking at human history and it is probably likely that the seeds for creativity began even before humans emerged in africa probably with our ancestors who used sticks for tools but let us stick with human history the first tool invented created manufactured by humans homo habits occurred 2.5 million years ago it is called the flake tool it was a rock that was sharpened at one edge that could be used for splitting nuts and fruit that lasted almost 1.4 million years now if all we ever did was conform we would still be using that tool today but something happened someone imagined another possibility and that led to an innovation in stone tools called the hand axe it is a symmetrical tool that can be held easily in the palm of the hand which made striking much easier that lasted about 600,000 years and then something interesting happened about 40,000 years ago there was something archaeologists call the creative explosion in africa homo sapient emerged the anatomically modern human homo sapient took imagination and went beyond functional use of imagination and they applied it to diverse areas for example at this time we went from thrusting weapons which means you have to be close to your prey to throwing weapons body decorations emerged art emerged for the first time cave paintings burial rituals the production of clothing purpose-built shelter and so forth what i suggest to you as a result of this human history demonstrates that you were born to be creative it is a natural part of who you are but it does not have to stop there we do not have to wait for our creativity to occur to magically appear what we know through research is that you can take what is innate and you can develop it further we can engage in what is called deliberate creativity creativity is like any other skill like all abilities what does that mean we all have it you have been born with it we are not all the same so we vary in the degree of traceability that we have but what we know is that through deliberate practice through training and through learning you can enhance your creative thinking in fact that is the reason why we exist at buffalo state the founding faculty members of our department conducted an empirical study students who went through a creativity course when compared to a control group showed significant cognitive gains so what is this creative cognition what is this innate set of thinking skills that we are all born with the two skills that we are all born with is an ability to engage in divert in thinking and convergent thinking and some scholars believe about 40,000 years ago one of the reasons why we had a creative explosion is that the mind developed evolved in such a way that homo sapient could begin to control their thinking and they could shift that is called contextual focus they could shift from divergent to converge and thinking divergent thinking is the ability to generate many varied and original options it is the creation of variation convergent thinking is the selection development of the most promising options now is not an interesting sounds a lot like evolution does not it were the two fundamental properties of evolution the creation of variation and the selective retention of those novel variations which enhance the ability to survive so the same thought process seems to parallel the process of evolution this is what we all have innately but although we have this innate skill we do not often use this skill this gift if you will to the best of our ability so let me talk a little bit about deliberate creativity so we can all engage in divergent thinking we can all engage in converse and thinking what often happens well we have an idea this novel idea sometimes the next thought that enters our mind is what a reason why it will not work it is too risky so and so will criticize me here's another example that may make it easier to to recognize this ineffective thought process imagine a meeting someone's called a meeting there is a problem that has to be solved the person who called the meeting says right we have got this tuffnut of a problem anybody have any ideas someone shares an idea what is often the next comment in that meeting yeah i will not work we do not have the budget for it that is crazy how about this one we have tried that before what happens to the creativity they get sucked out of the room right and what happens is we stick with the tried and true this area of familiarity really not that divergent in our thought process we conform to what is known so although we have this innate skill sometimes we do not use it effectively can we deliberately enhance this skill of creative thinking well two tips for you first of all learn how to suspend your judgment to defer judgment how often have you quickly criticized an idea only to find out later it really worked if you move quickly to convergence to judge fast you may limit your ability to see new possibilities second tip go for quantity this is well documented dean simonton creativity researcher who looked at eminently creative people found that one of the main differences between eminently creative people and ordinarily people like myself is that eminently creative people generate many more ideas pica's had 20,000 works of art shakespeare wrote 154 sonnets 37 plays prison gorge washington carver well-known inventors had many invention ideas of which a few revolutionized the world i learned recently by listening to nor that hemingway wrote 40 different endings to his book for whom the bell tolls before he chose which one to go with line is pal lines hauling the noble laureate said it best the best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas so if you want to be deliberately more creative take advantage of what nature has given you learn to suspend your judgment do not jump to conclusions too quickly and learn to generate many ideas why is this important historically hopefully i have made the case for how creativity has been part of our evolution but that is historically i would say today creativity and creative problem-solving has never been more important the flake tool that i shared with you earlier lasted for how long one point four million years today manufactured products go through fundamental redesign every five to ten years in the area of technology it is every six to twelve months we cannot afford to wait a million years for the next good idea right we cannot afford to wait for the creativity news to give us the breakthrough we have to find ways to be deliberately creative to accelerate what nature and evolution has given us a global study completed recently in fact this year by adobe conducted around the world 80% of those who were surveyed said that creativity is important to economic growth when asked about their own creativity one out of four surveyed one out of four said that they were living up to their creative potential when asked about their creativity experiences especially their educational experiences 59% said that school stifled their creativity and the us because we like to lead the world the number was higher it was 62% so what is happening here's one reason for why schools stifle creativity this comes from mark bronco a creativity researcher he says that most educational experiences or most educational efforts focus on convergent thinking remember divergent and convergent thinking finding the single right answer would not it be nice if life was that simple if every problem we came up to had only one single right answer but it is not and he says therefore these educational experiences may do very little if anything for creative potential i would go a little further and suggest that in an era of standardization and accountability in schools perhaps what we are teaching children to do is to be good conformist instead of teaching them how to be independent thinkers well let us make this a little more personal how about you and your creativity think about the degree to which you balance conformity and creativity in your own lives do you engage in flexible thinking do you engage in flexible behavior do you try new things are you open minded you may never i hope have to wrestle a tiger but life is complex and i am sure you will have to wrestle with tenacious problems up guilford one of the pioneers in the field of creativity said to live is to have problems and to solve problems is to grow creatively remember evolution may not have made you particularly strong or particularly fast but evolution has given you the gift of a creative mind if you deliberately use it if you deliberately develop it i guarantee you you will be more successful in dealing with life's complexities thank you",heard nuncio,creativity as a life skill
i am feeling really grateful to be here sharing this conference with you today grateful to have the opportunity to present grateful to have some friends in the audience friendly faces grateful for m drone studios this amazing creative space in the city all the innovative things that are happening here the fantastic production team just feel really grateful to be alive as a deal really um beautifully introduced i work with the cult of leadership program at the regenerative design institute in bonus um this program was founded by names stark and christopher bunch and like to give a little shout out to them there names is in india right now giving a ted talk flew all the way around the world and so it is pretty cool that i am doing this here and christopher is at the northern californium per permaculture convergence so it is just amazing how these seeds are going out all over the world and what we specialize in is inner permaculture so rid has a bunch of programs that are doing the kinds of things you have heard about today learning about gray water systems and permaculture design and deskilling and you know all the different practices that were hearing on the outer level but what we look like to look at is what happens if we look take a look at our inner garden so what are the shifts that need to happen on an inner level that then will create the possibility for transformation on an outer level that we really want to see in our own lives in our communities and in the world so my presentation today i am going to focus on what we call um a deceptively simple but profoundly transformation practice which is gratitude now i would like you to just imagine for a moment what would it be like to live in a city founded upon the principle of gratitude what it would be it would be like if you woke up in the morning and the first thought that came to your mind was wow i am just so grateful to have another day to be alive what would it be like if as you left the house in the morning first person that you ran into maybe it is your bus driver maybe it is the arista the local coffee shop you are like wow i am so grateful for you i just love the way that you make those little designs on my coffee makes me really happy every morning imagine as if we went to the workplace and you talked to your colleagues and you express your gratitude you know just take that extra moment to be like you know i really am grateful for the work that you are doing really grateful to work at this company really grateful to your employees your employer get home from the work at the end of a long day and express your gratitude to your spouse your partner your housemate go to bed at night with this feeling of gratitude what would it be like if we lived in a city founded upon gratitude now some might say that we actually do live in a culture that is based on gratitude so the first nations or indigenous peoples of this land which i have had the fortune of working with around the world practice thanksgiving on a regular basis and there is something called the thanksgiving address um this is a poster of it that i have in my home and it talks about all the different aspects of creation that we are grateful for you know ranging from the earth to the waters to the fish to the trees the plants the sun the moon and so as we ponder this you know idea of dwelling in gratitude i would like you to just close your eyes for a moment and connect to something you are feeling grateful for and i am going to share a little song um it is a gratitude song i say thank you oh i say thank you oh great spirit in this way i long to give my life to you in love and devotion in love and devotion so just let that little bit of gratitude sink in hold on to it maybe when we are done you can share it with your neighbor the person sitting next to you and i am going to take you on a little journey into how gratitude became a really central part of my life i was living in canada in the midst of a very snowy winter 2007 there was just feet and feet of snow and i was going through a really really hard time in my life you know so i was somebody who actually had had a pretty easeful life up until that point in time you know things seemed to come easily to me it was not really um i had not found myself in a moment of deep challenge but there it was you know i had a relationship that was falling apart i had a young baby year old i was starting a pod program i was in a new city where i did not know anybody and suddenly i found myself having trouble just even getting out of bed in the morning so every day i would wake up and i would have to struggle to find you know like what is the reason to get out of bed what is it that can really help me get through the day and as i would get out of bed i would get dressed and get my laptop get ready to go to school get my snow gear on my jacket and my t and get ready my snow boots get ready to trudge out into the wintry coal i would root in the practice of gratitude so i found that if i just dug deep and found the one thing that i was grateful for i could make it i could make it to the subway if i just focused on i am really grateful for my legs that can walk you know there is lots of people around the world who actually do not have that privilege i am really grateful for my breath just the ability to breathe in and out i am grateful for my eyes that can see grateful to have arms that can hold my baby you know i am just grateful and it was that practice that really got me through those really dark and deep days and you know even though i would worked with indigenous cultures around the world and even though i would been exposed to this on some level i would like to think that you know i just kind of came to it as a it is almost like it saved my life you know it was just rooting in that gratitude that got me through that time fast forward a couple of years um and i came out to californium and encountered the encountered the ecology of leadership program and i was really stunned to find that gratitude was a regular part of what they were practicing in the program so as i began my meetings with my coworkers we would start every single meeting with gratitude you know imagine that you know you have got an hurling meeting to take the first 10 minutes and just talk about what you are grateful for i was kind of like whoa this is revolutionary you know but we would just go around and around and it was not just one thing you know it was like hearing like 10 20 30 things that each person was feeling grateful for and it really changed my mind in terms of what was possible in an organizational culture and then as we started to i was doing my pod research on the program and its transformation impacts i got to see in a circle of people what became possible as um you created a culture of gratitude so every weekend when the group gathered everybody would sit down and think you know what is something that everyone in the circle is feeling grateful for and through it through my actual expos exposure to the program i began my own daily gratitude practice in a much more formal way um so i committed about a year ago to do a daily gratitude practice online on casebook where i would post it on a daily basis and kind of tell the world what i was grateful for and for me that was a way of really rooting into um a commitment these are just some of the pictures of things i was grateful for throughout the year um and what i found was that the more that i looked for something that i was grateful for the more that every day would find more and more things and so it became the self-reinforcing practice where i could not just find one thing that i was grateful for i would find more and more you know there the smell of the roses as i am walking down the street and the jasmine wafting over me and the beauty of this is my son helping me with the dishes um you know everywhere i looked i would just find things to be grateful for that is me feeling really grateful um outside of came gratitude in fact so what so so special about gratitude why is it that i mean this seemingly simple technology is so powerful now i would like to say that there is actual correlation between things like permaculture and gratitude in that you know both of these are actually not really new technologies you know like it is not surprising you can you have heard of gratitude before but uh like with permaculture we like to say that we are on the cutting edge of a thousand-year-old technology i think with gratitude it is kind of the same so this is an age-old thing but what would it be like if we really brought this to life in our cities and cultures and families and homes and organizations today now some of the principles of gratitude uh it is an affirmation of life itself so it is like just that waking up in the morning to be like i am thankful for another day like to me that is the most um honest and humble prayer that we can offer on a daily basis it shifts our focus from what is negative to what is positive so it is so easy in our culture to be critical or judging or always looking for what is wrong what is not right analyzing um whereas gratitude just shifts the focus just a little bit right to find what it is that is actually positive it is an opportunity for refrain so it gives us this new lens on life so even when something's really hard to focus on it the perspective of gratitude means to find what is right so i am really grateful actually that i got sick because i get this opportunity to rest and reflect and stay home and um you know curl up under the blankets and it is like finding what is good about even the hard situations and ultimately for me it connects me to something that is bigger than myself so it takes me out of my own self referential world into really opening to something bigger brother d avid um is a monk who is created an organization gratefulness.org i love this quote he says in daily life we must see that it is not happiness that makes us grateful but gratefulness that makes us happy it is a lot of recent studies about what the impacts of gratitude are on personal happiness and health and again it is like this is not revolutionary but actually it could be for our personal well-being and um health no regular gratitude practice that could be like just making a list of what you are grateful for on a daily basis or a weekly basis um contributes toward progress toward important person personal goals greater alertness enthusiasm determination attentiveness and energy better health sleep duration sleep quality greater energy optimism and positivity and a sense of feeling connected to others the greater good center at up berley is doing a new study on gratitude it will be really interesting to see what they come up with so quote this is the moment that you shift your mindset from this perspective of negativity and judgment to one of appreciation look at what happens to our bodies so your brain function becomes more balanced harmonized and supple your heart begins to pump in a much more coherent and harmonious rhythm and biochemical changes trigger a host of helpful responses throughout your body there is an actual science to this it is like m mindfulness meditation um gratitude has the same impact on your body and your brain and your heart studies of relationships and marriage um the man institute out of washington they say that the number one predictor of success in marriage is the level of gratitude so if you have at least a ratio five appreciations for every one negative comment or criticism then you will make it seriously so he said that they can predict with 90% accuracy the success of a couple after watching them for three minutes based on this interaction alone um which is pretty revolutionary like we kind of think should be 50/50 right like at least as much positive as the negative but actually we need to up our gratitude and appreciation of one another um five times in order just to make it and our family my son math um and i practice gratitude with my children and it is really amazing what they are capable of um even from a young age so my four-year-old has a much easier time with it than a seven-year-old and we will do rounds of gratitude like on the way to school in the morning or as we are getting ready to have dinner at night um we will just talk about what we are grateful for and matter will go on and on sometimes for a half an hour straight of all the things he is grateful for and he um he actually comes up with his own rules he says mom these are the rules for being great i am like what is that and he says well if you say god or ice cream you get to go twice gratitude in our organizations so this is from came gratitude of course which is an innovator right here in san francisco about creating this kind of culture um there is also jive which is a local hotel company which has implemented gratitude into the organization and similarly um chip convey the head of had he said that if you just have two practices of gratefulness a day in organization it can shift the entire culture so he committed personally as a coo just to tell two people in the company that he was grateful on a daily basis and it completely shifted the organizational culture so if all this is true then why do not we practice gratitude why do not we do it um maybe it is just deceptively simple we think this is you know that is kind of a low-level kindergarten sort of thing gratitude we do not really need to do that maybe we are afraid of putting ourselves out there so like you know maybe it would feel kind of vulnerable to go up to the very in the morning be like wow i just really love that design on my coffee you know like maybe that feels like it is taking a step outside of our comfort zone that would be um maybe a bit risky courageous we make assumptions we think people already know so like do you think to thank your spouse or partner for making the bed in the morning or you know cleaning up after they have a meal you know like we just take that for granted and we think well they are supposed to do that so i do not need to tell them i am grateful and we are also coming from these old world values of um individualism ins stinginess competition and so we are constantly thinking well why would i put myself out there when they are not telling me that they are grateful for me first right instead of creating this culture of generosity and giving it forward just leave you with some simple keys for if you want to incorporate gratitude in your life um some things that can really help be it whether you want to change your own personal life or a relationship or your organization or your community um number one is just to commit so for me the practice of saying i am going to do this on a daily basis and i am going to put it out there on casebook was really powerful but you can um commit just in your own personal way but just the practice of saying i am going to do this or like for chip convey to say i am going to give gratitude twice a day at my work um that was transformation in and of itself be real so you know it does not really work if you are expressing gratitude but you are actually not really feeling it has to really come from that place of feeling true and being something you genuinely notice that you are grateful for even if it is just as simple as your breath number three what you appreciate appreciates and so what i have noticed is that the more you notice what you are grateful for the more things you see that you are grateful for so you are able to actually cultivate that kind of beauty in your life so if you want to see more you know if i want to see my kids doing the dishes more the more i tell them i am grateful for it the more they are going to do it four is to do it together so it is actually really helpful to get on board with this with like your partner or your children or your organization so that you hold one another accountable because sometimes i am not feeling that grateful so it really helps me if then my kids say hey mom you know we really should do gratitude before dinner then we can do that together and the fifth principle this is kind of a magic secret of gratitude which is that it is possible to give thanks not just for what you see and what you already have but for what is yet to come so if you really want to experience more joy and love in your life or you really want to um you know live in a beautiful home in nature to give gratitude for that as if it is already happened and there is a seal principle of that in which gratitude actually becomes a creative act and you draw that thing to you by giving that thanks and it is like that total confidence of like yes i am so grateful that that thing already happened um and in my experience it really works so back to gratitude in city 2.0 i would like to suggest that gratitude is actually the fertilizer that could really cultivate the kinds of cities that we want to live in a resilient regenerative community you know just thinking back to you like what it would feel like to live in a city where this culture of appreciation and love was really pervasive where when you are walking down the street you have this feeling of just connection that sometimes feels really hard to attain in the city but i know that like for me this morning i had done my gratitude practice as i was driving down the hill and then i stopped to get a coffee and i was walking down the street and because i was feeling really grateful then i was smiling at all these people and they were smiling back at me and it was like just by my practicing the gratitude than i was able to feel like i lived in a city that was a culture of gratitude so as i close i would like to invite just to a little experiment um which is that you might try this out so as you leave here today maybe as we go into the networking portion at the end of the day just consider finding one thing you are grateful for and telling somebody see what happens maybe you go home and you find your beloved or um housemate at your house and you think to share something you are grateful for with that person see what happens and uh my information's up there you can be in touch let me know how it went for you um see what becomes possible if we really take responsibility for creating regenerative communities from the inside out thank you,data sol,the transformation power of gratitude
"early in my life i learned that there was one thing that could kill a festive mood at a dinner party and that was to talk about me to talk about my life my life as the daughter of a cult leader there was very little that was joking or lighthearted about the first 28 years of my life so i avoided that topic at all costs it was too painful nobody could understand so i became a master at diverting attention at during the conversation on to somebody else but not me i so rarely talked about my life that on the rare occasion when i would slip and somebody would kind of push for me to divulge i could not just casually and comfortably share it i would bond with the story and it would go something like this well i grew up outside of chico and my dad pastured actually a wonderful church there that through the years evolved into a 15,000 member cult it operated and it still operates under the guise of an independent fundamental baptist church but those who have left the followers have tried to leave outsiders even the media it was on 20/20 last year recognize that it is clearly a cult every member was in complete obedience father they did not dare disagree or be disloyal for fear of being publicly ridiculed or punished or banished for doing so they did not go on a vacation without asking my dad's permission and he had said they drink the kool-aid i am not kidding they would have my dad lived a double life one of righteous family man and dynamic speaker in the public eye but one of sordid sexual secrets privately secrets that only my siblings and me and my mom knew he hated my mom hated her treated her terribly abused her and even turned his own children against our mother we hated her he told us she was crazy we thought to make him happy we would hate her too our home was felt full of turmoil hatred stress strife and as a little girl it was isolating it was intense and it was frightening he had affairs had a mistress for many years the wife of a sunday-school teacher built her family a beautiful home right around the corner from our house you could see their family from our back door it was it was craziness living one way preaching another my brother my older brother he became another version of my father he took a he pastured a church in texts was found to have been having affairs with 14 different women divorced that current wife married one of the 14 my father tried desperately to cover it up moved into another church where he was found to have had 17 there was with different women and he just recreated what he had seen my dad with and my dad did nothing but cover it up i felt like i had one main responsibility as a child it was simple but daunting and that was to keep all the secrets there were so many you see he had taught us that the best way to please god was to please him because he was god's man and he taught us that to please him we had to keep all the secrets we could not even tell our best friends what went on in our home because we might be the causes for the destruction of his ministry i literally feared my very life if i ever talked about my dad's ministry but what went on in our home for fear that it would hurt his ministry i was so afraid and the greater the secrets the greater the fear and the greed of my determination to keep quiet i gotta tell you the money part of it was pretty nice as a kid i mean think about it tithes and offerings from 50,000 people know it created a lavish lifestyle for our family my father owned most of the city where the church was he owned to college to high schools to great schools a cemetery blocks of buildings he was very wealthy and even into our adult years he owned us he owned our homes our cars our furniture he owned our lives and we did not dare cross him because we were to her whose everything he died a multimillionaire he left nothing to his children he left everything to the organization which my younger sister and her husband now need and they still perpetuate his legacy the strict rules the undying loyalty and they still try to keep all the secrets i never understood why was i the only one that the four kids so tortured by the hypocrisy so disturbed by the mind control over thousands and thousands of people and so determined to find a better life why was i the only one that insisted on answers to my questions and why was i the only one that ultimately broke away and cut ties with the brainwashing the oppression the fear the secrets and the life that had never been my life i finally walked away when i was about 28 years of age then being estranged from my entire family and i did not see my family again until many years later at my dad's funeral okay see what i mean not a story to share at a dinner party i really got to the point after i left dinner that i could not talk about me for one thing who would understand for another thing it was too hard it hurt too bad so i made a mental note and permanent marker that said must never talk about my life and for many years i did not i could not however wonderful things had happened through the years since their therapy a lot of therapy deprogramming freedom from the mind control and i began to heal and learn and accept and forgive and even learn to be thankful that bizarre life that i had because i realized i was learning some amazing lessons from not only being there but from having the guts to leave and i now have values that are deeply carved in my very soul from that instead of these you do not get for reading a book or from a workshop or another person bellies that are only this deeply ingrained when you live what i live because my dad was a cult leader i now embrace three values and no one will ever take these away from me the first one is freedom to explore my own interests freedom to live within my own value system freedom to determine my own value system freedom to believe what i believe and never stifle what i believe freedom to disagree for you to ask questions and require honest answers freedom to learn who i am and freedom to love who i am the second value was truth i learned pretty quickly that i was not going to be very free until i dealt with what was true and that was hard for me truth was a scary word for me because i mean my entire life i had never been allowed to speak of what went on in our home i had never told even my best friends what went on in our house being truthful was one of the scariest things i could think of i learned that secrets grown in the dark but when exposed to the light of truth they start to lose their power many person my dear amazing therapist in callas texts who nurtured me and who loved me through years and years of healing she used to say to me kinda you are only as sick as your secrets you are only as sick as your secrets so i stopped keeping secrets and as scared as i was in my late is i finally began to deal with what was true i think it finally began to speak what was true and eventually learned how to live openly only in truth and the third value is courage did you know that you actually cannot have freedom or truth if you have no courage is a requirement for both you may desire to live in complete free and the complete truth but if you are lacking and courage you will live in neither one in my late is i had a tiny shred of courage not much but it was all i needed because my desire to live and be free and honest was somewhat great but that teeny shred of courage that i had was enough to allow me to walk away i have a plaque on my desk that i have had for years and it is gone with me everywhere i have ever moved it says the secret to happiness is freedom and the secrets of freedom is courage and that resonated with me i knew it was not going to be happy unless i was free but i knew i was not going to be free my second some courage to get out of there i had to cling to and act upon that tiny shred of courage in order to finally leave a cult the only friends i never know my childhood connections my history my family knowing that in doing so i finally have what i had longed for my entire life and that was freedom true freedom truth courage three words that maybe kind of trite and overused to some people to me they are the air that i breathe values upon which i insist on living and loving in my life oh and one other thing i actually know about you sharing my story talking about me i now recognize that it is in sharing my story and i can so passionately share with you my values gained over 28 years not an emotional prison that kept my heart under lock and key and kept my mind for knowing what i knew you know i sometimes wonder if perhaps living in the absence of our values is what can most clearly determine what indeed our values are and for me i really believe that the apes and the denial of created the presence of for so many years i was denied freedom truth and courage and now i will never let them go not to worry you are still not going to find me at a dinner party he is talking about my childhood not going to happen you will not find me sitting around elaborating over my father who took a wonderful church and turn it into a fifty thousand member cult i still know that is a mood killer i get it but you will find me here and in other appropriate settings especially if i can help somebody talking about my life with sincere gratitude for all that i have learned in spite of and because of living in the absence of freedom truth and courage and thank god i now have by now you",kinda murphy,from cult to courage
"if i was to ask you what is coos view as the most crucial factor for business success what would you say some of you might think business rigor perhaps vision maybe even manager discipline but you would be mistaken according to a study by ism the number one factor identified for business success believe it or not is creativity but we have a problem these leaders say that creativity is core to business success however they are unknowingly choking it out of the business environment so how do we bridge this gap as a design leader in silicon valley for a dozen years i have been spending some time thinking about this problem and i believe we have a fundamental misunderstanding of creativity we need to start by rejecting the notion that creativity belongs to a select few that it is owned by the creative right brain thinkers the painters the playwrights the poets and that it is unavailable to the more logical left brain thinkers the mathematicians computer scientists engineers i am here to tell you today we all have the capacity for creative thinking in fact creativity is a birthright available to all but used by few once we come to accept and acknowledge the fact that we can all be creative thinkers we can focus on its development so how do we ignite how do we ignite creativity the answer is in our past pica's once said every child is an artist the problem is staying an artist when you grow up i would like to invite you all to take a moment step back to your childhood we questioned the world we were curious about everything and we were naturally observant did you know how do we change the average preschooler asked 100 questions a day we can draw a lot of inspiration about creativity our childhood it starts by opening our minds looking for new possibilities and challenging the status duo just like parents foster creativity and their children we must do the same in the workplace so how do we change i would like to share three strategies three strategies i believe everyone in this room can use to bring creativity to their workplace let us start by talking environments about environments are the foundation for creative thinking if you look at most business environments today this is what they look like not very inspiring boring bland rows of cubes equally boring and uninspiring meeting rooms and the tools that we use generic computers wine notebooks black pins one of the core aspects of creative thinking is ideation exploring a variety of ideas collaborating and these kinds of spaces and tools just do not foster that behavior but think back to your childhood these are the kinds of spaces you have worked and played in a variety of different locations for different kinds of activities bold bright colorful energetic and the tools we used blank paper colored pencils pens paint markers everything we needed for imagination and creation the good news companies are catching on and they are recognizing the importance of the environment microdot googly legs just to name a few are investing in spaces like these they are getting the importance of creating a variety of spaces for employees at citric where i work we opened a design collaboration space inspired by the design school at standard it is 2,000 square feet of wide open space filled with whiteboards tables fools it is easily configurable so you can create any kind of unique working environment creative supplies are everywhere at your fingertips the room is available at all times designed for spontaneous collaboration a radical change happened when we open this space it was pretty incredible instead of preaching about the merits of collaboration and ideation we started seeing it happen real time every day and even better employees are telling us they love this new way of working and they are coming up with better ideas that are impacting our products environment is the foundation for creative thinking a experiments second way that we can all ignite creativity in our workplace is through experiments but the problem we have is we are so laser focused on execution on process on efficiency that we are missing the opportunity for innovation we create cultures where we are afraid to fail and as a result we do the same thing again and again and again because it is what we know and it feels safe but we are not able to innovate by repeating the same thing we get trapped in this cycle of micro improvements of incremental ism and missing out on that great opportunity for creative innovation go back to your childhood there was no one way to build a tower of blocks or to make a fantastic creation from play-doh to build a snowman after a snowfall and if we failed it was okay it was part of the process we need to bring this mindset back to the workplace homes prison made a thousand prototyping unsuccessful attempts before inventing the light bulb but he saw this as part of the process he said the light bulb was an invention with a thousand step we need to embrace this mindset of experimenting we need to learn to fail fast and fail early we need to take our ideas and improve them and iterate them this is how ideas go from good to spectacular a really great way to do this is through prototypes are models created cheaply and quickly using everyday items you can take these prototypes and you can show them to customers you can explore a broad array of ideas with prototypes throw away the ones that do not work and continue to refine the ones that do it is the best way to experiment and fail fast fail early a really famous example of prototyping comes from idea a design agency in silicon valley they used this prototype made from a marker a film canister and a clothespin and they brought it to surgeons this prototype resonated so well with the surgeons that they were able to come up with a whole host of ideas of how to improve this surgical device and bring it to life idea was able to use this great information and feedback to refine the idea and ultimately generate a real surgical device that tripled the clients revenue in this product space so although experimenting and prototyping may in some way seem like child's play it is actually driving real innovation and business success a third storytelling way that you can all ignite creativity in the workplace is through storytelling ted is the most fantastic example of storytelling spreading ideas through stories that touch people but in the business environment we have just lost the art of storytelling i think we have all sat through this presentation a stack of cold boring bullets on a screen no emotion no context what have we done stories have the ability to inspire and persuade like these kinds of presentations never will like fax reports and charts just cannot rewind a the power of stories childhood we were all natural storytellers we told stories through replay we empathized with our characters and captured the hearts minds and imagination of our audience we need to bring this back to the work environment stories have a really powerful ability to package information context and emotion there are a few things that i believe makes stories really successful first of all they start with passion and emotion and vision they are not at all about constraints and timeline they make your customer the hero someone that your audience wants to invent for they are hanging on every word they want to see that customer succeed and lastly stories drive conversations they are not just one-way monologues they leave the audience wanting more they want to understand they want to help bring your idea to life one of my we healthcare favorite examples of story led innovation comes from we healthcare dog diet an industrial designer for 20 years decided he was going to go out and see his iris being used in the hospital and he made a really unexpected discovery this experience of a child receiving an mi the child was crying in the hallway and the father leaned down and said remember i told you have to be brave dog was so moved by this experience that he wanted to learn more he discovered that many children have to be sedated because this experience of an mi is so terrifying this increased risk cost and stress on the family and the child dog was so determined to solve this problem he went back to we health care and told this story a group of people were so inspired that they wanted to work with him they wanted to change the ending of this story and the results is pretty incredible they developed the adventure series of scanners this one is actually called the cozy camp experience and as soon as the child opens the door they are off on a camping adventure they snuggle into a sleeping bag and when they go into the mi machine it is now an adventure in a tent he and his team completely transformed this experience from one of terror risk and cost to one of complete joy pretty incredible the good news is lots of companies are getting the importance of stories these are pictures from my workplace people are telling stories with their ideas using prototypes and bringing them to life creativity has the power for invention and ultimate success environments experiments and storytelling are just a few of the ways that i believe you can inject it into your workplace but remember creativity is a birthright it is available to all but used by few so i ask you to embrace empower and insist on creativity in your workplace and watch the ideas unfold thank you",gathering courage,igniting creativity to transform corporate culture
"good morning how are you audience good it is been great has not it i have been blown away by the whole thing in fact i am leaving laughter three themes there have been three themes running through the conference which are relevant to what i want to talk about one is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we have had and in all of the people here just the variety of it and the range of it the second is that it is put us in a place where we have no idea what is going to happen in terms of the future no idea how this may play out i have an interest in education actually what i find is everybody has an interest in education do not you i find this very interesting if you are at a dinner party and you say you work in education i actually you are not often at dinner parties frankly laughter if you work in education you are not asked laughter and you are never asked back curiously that is strange to me but if you are and you say to somebody you know they say what do you do and you say you work in education you can see the blood run from their face they are like oh my god why me laughter my one night out all week laughter education but if you ask about their education they pin you to the wall because it is one of those things that goes deep with people am i right like religion and money and other things so i have a big interest in education and i think we all do we have a huge vested interest in it partly because it is education that is meant to take us into this future that we cannot grasp if you think of it children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065. nobody has a clue despite all the expertise that is been on parade for the past four days what the world will look like in five years time and yet we are meant to be educating them for it so the unpredictability i think is extraordinary and the third part of this is that we have all agreed nonetheless on the really extraordinary capacities that children have i their capacities for innovation i mean siren last night was a marvel was not she just seeing what she could do and she is exceptional but i think she is not so to speak exceptional in the whole of childhood what you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent and my contention is all kids have tremendous talents and we squander them pretty ruthlessly so i want to talk about education and i want to talk about creativity my contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy and we should treat it with the same status applause thank you applause that was it by the way thank you very much laughter so 15 minutes left laughter well i was born ... "" laughter a great story i heard a great story recently i i love telling it i of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson she was six and she was at the back drawing and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention and in this drawing lesson she did the teacher was fascinated she went over to her and she said what are you drawing and the girl said i am drawing a picture of god and the teacher said but nobody knows what god looks like and the girl said they will in a minutes laughter when my son was four in inland i actually he was four everywhere to be honest laughter if we are being strict about it wherever he went he was four that years he was in the nativity play do you remember the story laughter not it was big it was a big story mel gibbon did the sequel you may have seen it laughter nativity ii."" but names got the part of joseph, which we were thrilled about we considered this to be one of the lead parts we had the place crammed full of agents in t-shirts: names robins is joseph!"" laughter he did not have to speak but you know the bit where the three kings come in they come in bearing gifts gold frankincense and myrrh this really happened we were sitting there and i think they just went out of sequence because we talked to the little boy afterward and said you of with that they said yeah why was that wrong they just switched the three boys came in four-year-old's with tea towels on their heads they put these boxes down and the first boy said i bring you gold and the second boy said i bring you myrrh and the third boy said frank sent this laughter what these things have in common is that kids will take a chance if they do not know they will have a got am i right they are not frightened of being wrong being wrong i do not mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative what we do know is if you are not prepared to be wrong you will never come up with anything original i if you are not prepared to be wrong and by the time they get to be adults most kids have lost that capacity they have become frightened of being wrong and we run our companies like this we stigmatize mistakes and we are now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make and the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities pica's once said this he said that all children are born artists the problem is to remain an artist as we grow up i believe this passionately that we do not grow into creativity we grow out of it or rather we get educated out of it so why is this i lived in stratford-on-avon until about five years ago in fact we moved from stratiform to lot angels so you can imagine what a seamless transition this was laughter actually we lived in a place called snitterfield, just outside stratford, which is where shakespeare's father was born are you struck by a new thought i was you do not think of shakespeare having a father do you do you because you do not think of shakespeare being a child do you shakespeare being seven i never thought of it i mean he was seven at some point he was in somebody's english class was not he laughter how annoying would that be laughter must try harder laughter being sent to bed by his dad to shakespeare, go to bed now to willing shakespeare. and put the pencil down laughter and stop speaking like that laughter it is confusing everybody laughter anyway we moved from stratiform to lot angels moving to lot angels and i just want to say a word about the transition actually my son did not want to come i have got two kids he is 21 now my daughter's 16. he did not want to come to lot angels he loved it but he had a girlfriend in england. this was the love of his life saran he would known her for a months laughter mind you they would had their fourth anniversary because it is a long time when you are 16. he was really upset on the plane he said i will never find another girl like sarah."" and we were rather pleased about that frankly i laughter because she was the main reason we were leaving the country laughter hierarchy of subjects but something strikes you when you move to america and travel around the world every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects every one does not matter where you got you would think it would be otherwise but it is not at the top are mathematics and languages then the humanities at the bottom are the arts everywhere on earth and in pretty much every system too there is a hierarchy within the arts art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance there is not an education system on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics why why not i think this is rather important i think math is very important but so is dance children dance all the time if they are allowed to we all do we all have bodies do not we did i miss a meeting laughter truthfully what happens is as children grow up we start to educate them progressively from the waist up and then we focus on their heads and slightly to one side if you were to visit education as an alien and say what is it for public education i think you would have to conclude if you look at the output who really succeeds by this who does everything they should who gets all the brownie points who are the winners i i think you would have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors is not it they are the people who come out the top and i used to be one so there laughter and i like university professors but you know we should not hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement they are just a form of life another form of life but they are rather curious and i say this out of affection for them there is something curious about professors in my experience i not all of them but typically i they live in their heads they live up there and slightly to one side they are disembodied you know in a kind of literal way they look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads laughter do not they it is a way of getting their head to meetings laughter if you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences by the way get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque on the final night laughter and there you will see it grown men and women writhing uncontrollably off the beat laughter waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it laughter academic ability our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability and there is a reason around the world there were no public systems of education really before the with century they all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism so the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas number one that the most useful subjects for work are at the top so you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kids things you liked on the grounds you would never get a job doing that is that right do not do music you are not going to be a musicians do not do art you will not be an artist benign advice i now profoundly mistaken the whole world is engulfed in a revolution and the second is academic ability which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence because the universities design the system in their image if you think of it the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance and the consequence is that many highly talented brilliant creative people think they are not because the thing they were good at at school was not valued or was actually stigmatized and i think we cannot afford to go on that way in the next 30 years according to unesco, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history more people and it is the combination of all the things we have talked about technology and its transformational effect on work and demography and the huge explosion in population suddenly degrees are not worth anything is not that true when i was a student if you had a degrees you had a job if you did not have a job it is because you did not want one and i did not want one frankly laughter but now kids with degrees are often heading home intelligence to carry on playing video games because you need an ma where the previous job required a bad and now you need a pod for the other it is a process of academic inflation and it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet we need to radically rethink our view of intelligence we know three things about intelligence one it is diverse we think about the world in all the ways that we experience it we think visually we think in sounds we think kinesthetically. we think in abstract terms we think in movement secondly intelligence is dynamic if you look at the interactions of a human brain as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations intelligence is wonderfully interactive the brain is not divided into compartments in fact creativity i which i define as the process of having original ideas that have value i more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things by the way there is a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum. it is thicker in women following off from been yesterday this is probably why women are better at multitasking because you are are not you there is a raft of research but i know it from my personal life if my wife is cooking a meal at home which is not often ... thankfully laughter not she is good at some things but if she is cooking she is dealing with people on the phone she is talking to the kids she is painting the ceiling i laughter she is doing open-heart surgery over here if i am cooking the door is shut the kids are out the phone's on the hook if she comes in i get annoyed i say terry please i am trying to fry an egg in here laughter give me a break laughter actually do you know that old philosophical thing if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it did it happened remember that old chestnut i saw a great shirt recently which said if a man speaks his mind in a forest and no woman hears him is he still wrong laughter and the third thing about intelligence is it is distinct epiphany i am doing a new book at the moment called ""epiphany,"" which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent i am fascinated by how people got to be there it is really prompted by a conversation i had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of million linnet have you heard of her some have she is a choreographer and everybody knows her work she did cats and phantom of the operate she is wonderful i used to be on the board of the royal ballet as you can see laughter million and i had lunch one day i said how did you get to be a dancer it was interesting when she was at school she was really hopeless and the school in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said we think million has a learning disorder she could not concentrate she was fidgeting i think now they would say she had add would not you but this was the 1930s, and add had not been invented at this point it was not an available condition laughter people were not aware they could have that laughter anyway she went to see this specialist so this oak-paneled room and she was there with her mother and she was led and sat on this chair at the end and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about all the problems million was having at school because she was disturbing people her homework was always late and so on little kid of eight in the end the doctor went and sat next to million and said i have listened to all these things your mother's told me i need to speak to her privately wait here we will be back we will not be very long and they went and left her but as they went out of the room he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk and when they got out of the room he said to her mother just stand and watch her and the minute they left the room she was on her feet moving to the music and they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said ""mrs. linnet million is not sick she is a dancer take her to a dance school i said what happened she said she did i cannot tell you how wonderful it was we walked in this room and it was full of people like me i people who could not sit still people who had to move to think who had to move to think they did ballet they did tape jazz they did modern they did contemporary she was eventually auditioned for the royal ballet school she became a soloist she had a wonderful career at the royal ballet she eventually graduated from the royal ballet school founded the million line dance company met drew blood webbed she is been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history she is given pleasure to millions and she is a multimillionaire somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down applause what i think it comes to is this a gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by rather carbon i believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth for a particular commodity and for the future it will not serve us we have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we are educating our children there was a wonderful quote by donas talk who said if all the insects were to disappear from the earth within 50 years all life on earth would end if all human beings disappeared from the earth within 50 years all forms of life would flourish and he is right what ted celebrates is the gift of the human imagination we have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we have talked about and the only way we will do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are and our task is to educate their whole being so they can face this future by the way i we may not see this future but they will and our job is to help them make something of it

when i was 27 years old i left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding teaching i went to teach seventh'-graders math in the new york city public schools and like any teacher i i did quizzes and tests i gave out homework assignments when the work came back i calculated grades what struck me was that i was not the only difference between my best and my worst students some of my strongest performers did not have stratosphere i scores some of my smartest kids were not doing so well and that got me thinking the kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math sure they are hard ratios decimals the area of a parallelogram but these concepts are not impossible and i was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough after several more years of teaching i came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective from a psychological school perspective in education the one thing we know how to measure best is i but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily so i left the classroom and i went to graduate school to become a psychologist i started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings and in every study today my question was who is successful here and why my research team and i went to west point military academy we tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out we went to the national spelling bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition we studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the of the school years and of those who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students we partnered with private companies asking which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs and who is going to earn the most money in in all those very different contexts one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success and it was not social intelligence it was not good looks physical health and it was not i it was grit grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals grit is having stamina grit is sticking with your future day in day out not just for the week not just for the months but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality grit is living life like it is a marathon not a sprint a few years ago i started started studying grit in the chico public schools i asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduated turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduated even when i match them on every characteristic i could measure things like family income standardized achievement test scores even how safe kids felt when they were at school so it is not just at west point or the national spelling bee that grit matters it is also in school especially for kids at risk for dropping out to me the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know how little science knows about building it every day parents and teachers ask me how do i build grit in kids what do i do to teach kids a solid work ethics how do i keep them motivated for the long run the honest answer is i do not know what i do know is that talent does not make you gritty our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments in fact in our data grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent so far the best idea i have heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset this is an it is an idea developed at standard university by carol deck and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change with your effort dry deck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge they are much more likely to persevere when they fail because they do not believe that failure is a permanent condition so growth mindset i said is a great idea for building grit but we need more and that is where i am going to end my remarks because that is where we are that is the work that stands before us we need to take our best ideas our strongest intuitions and we need to test them we need to measure whether we have been successful and we have to be willing to fail to be wrong to start over again with lessons learned in other words we need to be gritty about getting kids grittier thank you,angel lee duckworth,grit the power of passion and perseverance
"so have you ever walked in front of a glass facade and see yourself in the reflection and try to check yourself out oh wait wait i forgot the glass facade is there not for you but it is for the people on the inside to get a great view out and they are probably looking at you picking the spinach from your teeth have you ever walked in in a city come upon a very large commercial building and in the very hot heat of the summer the doors fly open you feel that air conditioned air come out and blast you and you just sit there and wallow in that cool air oh wait i forgot that cool air is for the people on the inside it is a private building they will not even let you in to use a bathroom have you ever wondered why cities get hotter and hotter every years oh wait i forgot in order to cool these buildings the air conditioning systems have to give off air and emit it to the atmosphere making it hotter and hotter every years contributing to the heat island effect so i am an architect a building teach innovator and a 10,000 step a day pedestrian and i want to talk about how buildings can not only benefit the people on the inside of but they can actually improve life for those on the outside so if you go back into history things were different right in the cave humans had to only worry about the interior the outside facade was designed by nature once leaving the cave humans then started to stack rocks to make shelter and in doing so inadvertently made some of the earliest facades from there culture refined building construction techniques refined they discovered that the outside facade that is very public facing can actually tell stories and narratives it could be used for public service so they can tell stories about the family the histories the conquest the wealth the status all these types of things appeared on facades and facades became a thing so fast forward we have new technologies new materials we are able to thin out the building so it is transparent the facade itself but the problem is glass is a very poor insulator and that glass then could let the heat in the cool in and we had to develop big air conditioning systems heating systems to make the interiors even tolerable to stay in and more recently we want to keep that transparency we want the glass the view but in order to do that and make the systems efficient we had to expand that facade system again so it is highly engineered now to keep out the heat the cold the moisture and glare so all these systems in order to make it happen even have four panes of glass to do it it is comfortable it works but what do we do next so i would like to propose that that thickness of the facade still be used to make people on the inside comfortable but can we think about the outside portion of the facade benefiting people on the outside can we actually think about those thousands of square feet of surface area not millions of square feet of surface area inside the city and use it for the public can we use it for infrastructure and for public good so i am going to show you a few technologies of other people that do that here we can make habitats for animals ecosystems like these for bees birds bats all kinds of animals are even important to cities this is a habitat for microorganisms they are invisible but they are essential to our livelihood just like the microsomes inside your guts think about the robotic qualities of it the same thing has to happen to cities water is an important resources and so in this system it not only collects water but it also can purify it as well as store it in a hyper localized way so that places where water security is an issue starts to eliminate and reduce think about areas that have drought and we can also modulate the surfaces perforate the different types of materials in order to reduce the amount of noise pollution in streets so think about garbage trucks sirens honking hoards that type of stuff can actually diminish with new technologies in my own work i look at architecture as something that can contribute positively to sustainability to equity and to wellness i am going to show you two technologies at different levels of development that i use and apply to public health issues so the first one is a smog eating panel for architecture and in this case it actually starts to filter particulate matter and noxious waste in cities in urban canyon areas so an urban canyon is when a street is lined by two very tall buildings on both sides forming a canyon like scenario and what happens is in these areas the air movement is very predictable it comes from prevailing winds from thermal convection from the movement of vehicles in there and it moves in a circular pattern where it makes it very difficult for the heavy particulate matter to escape so therefore it just keeps going through and accumulates in the bottom over time more and more so what we are trying to do is modulate the surface so that the surface can allow those prevailing winds to flow into these tubes to filter that smog and move out as fresh air so you can see here we use models and wind tunnels that we build as well as simulation modeling to test it we pack the tubes together so that we can maximize the efficacy of it as well as minimize the material it takes to make it and we put them in such position of where that wind flow is actually going and so that it would have an easy time going into the tubes cleaning the air and coming out as fresh air we also use the thermal convection model where in the case the pavement is heating the air that hot air wants to rise up the face of the building they can go into these tubes also to filter and then send out fresh air so it is done in a very passive way and not only do we try to apply this to building facades so that the facades are doing the cleaning we want to actually design these bus shelters that can use this kind of technology bringing the freshest pockets of air to the people who spend the most amount of time on the streets breathing the worst air another technology that i am working on is a self shading window system here you can see it basically what it does is it shades the interior automatically so that you can use less energy on air conditioning the idea came from using the thermal bimetal material which is a material that curls when heated and we make these very low teach robots that we do for fun in our office i know everybody chuckles when they see it and it is important that you know that because what happens is people get connected to them as if they are little pets as if they are alive and even we name them this one's actually called roll poly so from there the idea was that we use this thermal bimetal on the facade of a building so that it actually can react to the outdoor environment and through the course of a day through the course of a years as the temperature changes all the time the building would also change to follow them and if we can animate a building then possibly we can get people to also feel more connected to the building like their pets and if we do that we can make people smile more they can cherish their buildings and they could even feel protective of their cities so therefore the happiness level of the city can go up as well as mental health so we embrace this idea of putting bimetal in the facade in this case it is actually in the cavity of a double glazed standard window system and we allow these little critters again like butterflies to flutter around and flip so when the heat comes in you can see simulated like the sun these pieces will flip over and respond to any changes outside what happens too is when they flip you can still see pretty well through the system it does not block your view so that it turns into a blackout situation and then when the sun goes away they go back to their original position so what happens too is because it is a pixelate system we can put graphics on it it opens as enclosed whenever it wants to so that you can start to see the graphics the result is it is awe inspiring it is lipophilic and it is magical and i am happy to say that it is also safe for birds right birds on the outside so it is actually a great thing we are hoping to put this technology onto buildings as soon as the end of this years so stay tuned for that so how can we get a lot of these cool technologies on buildings this is the big question i have three suggestions the first one is change policy can we require owners and contractors and real estate developers to spend a percentage of their construction cost on public centric technologies for facades can we do that two think entrepreneurially can owners actually rent lease sell this facade to others for infrastructure can it be to agriculture can it be to you mean even not for profit you mean situations can it be for utility companies there is a lot of possibilities that can happen and three advocate for change renters inside the buildings must start to demand that their building facades are much more magnanimous because think about it everybody in these buildings must come out to the streets too and together we can actually enjoy the improvements to our society and public health so next time you go out into a city and you are walking around look carefully at the buildings they do not have to be just a pretty face they can serve a bigger purpose thank you",dorms sung,how buildings can improve life â inside and out
"i have a confession to make but first i want you to make a little confession to me in the past years i want you to just raise your hand if you have experienced relatively little stress anyone how about a moderate amount of stress who is experienced a lot of stress yeah me too but that is not my confession my confession is this i am a health psychologist and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier but i fear that something i have been teaching for the last 10 years is doing more harm than good and it has to do with stress for years i have been telling people stress makes you sick it increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease basically i have turned stress into the enemy but i have changed my mind about stress and today i want to change yours let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress this study tracked 30,000 adults in the united states for eight years and they started by asking people how much stress have you experienced in the last years they also asked do you believe that stress is harmful for your health and then then they use public death records to find out who died okay some bad news first people who experience a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43 % increased risk of dying but that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health people who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die in fact they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study including people who had relatively little stress now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths 182,000 20,000 america died prematurely not from stress but from the belief that stress is bad for you that is over 20,000 deaths a years now if that estimate is correct that would make believing stress is bad for you the with largest cause of death in the united states last years killing more people than skin cancer hive aids and homicide you can see why the study freaked me out here i have been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health so this study got me wondering can changing how you think about stress make you healthier and here the science says yes when you change your mind about stress you can change your body's response to stress now to explain how this works i want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out it is called the social stress test you come into the laboratory and you are told you have to give a five minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you and to make sure you feel the pressure there are bright lights and a camera in your face like this and the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging nonverbal feedback like this now that you are sufficiently demoralized time for part two a math test and unbeknownst to you the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it now we are going to all do this together it is going to be fun for me okay i want you all to count backwards words from 996 in increments of seven you are going to do this out loud as fast as you can starting with 996. got go faster faster please you are going too slow stop stop stop stop that guy made a mistake we are going to have to start all over again you are not very good at this are you okay so you get the idea now if you were actually in this study you would probably be a little stressed out your heart might be pounding you might be breathing fast or maybe breaking out into a sweat and normally we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we are not coping very well with the pressure but what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized was preparing you to meet this challenge now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at hazard university before they went through the social stress test they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful that pounding heart is preparing you for action if you are breathing faster it is no problem it is getting more oxygen to your brain and participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance well they were less stressed out less anxious more confident but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed now in a typical stress response your heart rate goes up and your blood vessels constrict like this and this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease it is not really healthy to be in this state all the time but in the study when participants view their stress response as helpful their blood vessel stayed relaxed like this their heart was still pounding but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile it actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage over a lifetime of stressful experiences this one biological change could be the difference between a stress'-induced heart attack at age 50 and living well into your 90s. and this is really what the new science of stress reveals that how you think about stress matters so my goal as a health psychologist has changed i no longer want to get rid of your stress i want to make you better at stress and we just did a little intervention if you raise your hand and said you would had a lot of stress in the last years we could have saved your life because hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress you are going to remember this talk and you are going to think to yourself this is my body helping me rise to this challenge and when you view stress in that way your body believes you and your stress response becomes healthier so now i said i have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from so we are going to do one more intervention i want to tell you about one of the most underappreciated aspects of the stress response and the idea is this stress makes you social to understand the side of stress we need to talk about a hormones oxytocin and i know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get it even has its own cute nickname the cuddle hormones because it is released when you hug someone but this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in oxytocin is a neurohormone. it fine'-tunes your brain's social instinct it primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family it enhances your empathy it even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin to become more compassionate and caring but here's what most people do not understand about oxytocin it is a stress hormones your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response it is as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pounds and when oxytocin is released in the stress response it is motivating you to seek support your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel instead of bottling it up your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other when life is difficult your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you okay so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier well oxytocin does not only act on your brain it also acts on your body and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress it is a natural anti'-inflammatory. it also helps your blood vessel stay relaxed during stress but my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart your heart has receptors for this hormones and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate and heal from any stress'-induced damage this stress hormone strengthens your heart and the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support so when you reach out to others under stress either to seek support or to help someone else you release more of this hormones your stress response becomes healthier and you actually recover faster from stress i find this amazing that your stress response has a built'-in mechanism for stress resilience and that mechanism is human connection i want to finish by telling you about one more study and listen up because this study could also save a life this study tracked about a thousand adults in the united states and they ranged in age from 34 to 93. and they started the study by asking how much stress have you experienced in the last years they also asked how much time have you spent helping out friends neighbors people in your community and then they use public records for the next five years to find out who died okay so the bad news first for every major stressful life experience like financial difficulties or family crisis that increased the risk of dying by 30 i but and i hope you are expecting a but by now but that was not true for everyone people who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress'-related increase in dying zero caring created resilience and so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not inevitable how you think and how you act can transform your experience of stress when you choose to view your stress response as helpful you create the biology of courage and when you choose to connect with others under stress you can create resilience now i would not necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life but this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress stress gives us access to our hearts the compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connecting with others and yes your pounding physical heart working so hard to give you strength and energy and when you choose to view stress in this way you are not just getting better at stress you are actually making a pretty profound statement you are saying that you can trust yourself to handle life's challenges and you are remembering that you do not have to face them alone thank you thank you this is amazing what you are telling us it seems amazing to me that a belief about stress can make so much difference to someone's life expectancy how would that extend to send to advice if someone's making a lifestyle choice between say a stressful job and a non'-stressful job does it matter which way they got that it is equally wise to go for the stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it in some sense yeah and one thing we know for certain is that chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort and so i would say that is really the best way to make decisions is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows.thank. you so much kelly.thank you that is really cool",kelly

the human voice it is the instrument we all play it is the most powerful sound in the world probably it is the only one that can start a war or say i love you and yet many people have the experience that when they speak people do not listen to them why is that how can we speak powerfully to make change in the world what i would like to suggest there are a number of habits that we need to move away from i have assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking i am not pretending this is an exhaustive list but these seven second i think are pretty large habits that we can all fall into first gossip speaking ill of somebody who is not present not a nice habit and we know perfectly well the person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us second judging we know people who are like this in conversation and it is very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you are being judged and found wanting at the same time third negativity you can fall into this my mother in the last years of her life became very very negative and it is hard to listen i remember one day i said to her it is october the first today and she said i know is not it dreadful it is hard to listen when somebody's that negative and another form of negativity complaining well this is the national art of the up it is our national sports we complain about the weather about sports about politics about everything but actually complaining is viral misery it is not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world excuses we have all met this guys maybe we have all been this guys some people have a blame thrower they just pass it on to everybody else and do not take responsibility for their actions and again it is hard to listen to somebody who is being like that penultimate the six of the seven embroidery exaggeration it demeans our language actually sometimes for example if i see something that really is awesome what do i call it and then of course this exaggeration becomes out and out lying we do not want to listen to people we know are lying to us and finally dogmatism the confusion of facts with opinions when those two things get conflated you are listening into the wind somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true it is difficult to listen to that so here they are seven deadly sins of speaking these are things i think we need to avoid but is there a positive way to think about this yes there is i would like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones foundations that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world fortunately these things spell a word the word is hale and it has a great definition as well i am not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head i am talking about this definition to greet or acclaim enthusiastically which is i think how our words will be received if we stand on these four things so what do they stand for see if you can guess the he honesty of course being true in what you say being straight and clear the a is authenticity just being yourself a friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth which i think is a lovely way to put it the i is integrity being your word actually doing what you say and being somebody people can trust and the l is love i do not mean romantic love but i do mean wishing people well for two reasons first of all i think absolute honesty may not be what we want i mean my goodness you look ugly this morning perhaps that is not necessary tempered with love of course honesty is a great thing but also if you are really wishing somebody well it is very hard to judge them at the same time i am not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously so hail also now that is what you say and it is like the old song it is what you say it is also the way that you say it you have an amazing toolbox this instrument is incredible and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened i would like to have a little rummage in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with which will increase the power of your speaking register for example now falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time but there is a register in between i am not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches you can locate your voice however so if i talk up here in my nose you can hear the difference if i go down here in my throat which is where most of us speak from most of the time but if you want weight you need to go down here to the chest you hear the difference we vote for politicians with lower voices it is true because we associate depth with power and with authority that is a register and we have timbre it is the way your voice feels again the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich smooth warm like hot chocolate well if that is not you that is not the end of the world because you can train go get a voice coach and there are amazing things you can do with breathing with posture and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice then prosody i love prosody this is the sing song the met language that we use in order to impart meaning it is root one for meaning in conversation people who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they do not have any prosody at all that is where the word monotonic comes from or monotonous monotone also we have repetitive prosody now coming in where every sentence ends as if it were a question when it is actually not a question it is a statement if you repeat that one over and over it is actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody which i think is a shame so let us try and break that habit pace i can get very very excited by saying something really really quickly or i can slow right down to emphasize and at the end of that of course is our old friend silence there is nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk is there we do not have to fill it with us and us can be very powerful of course pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal but you can do it just with pitch where did you leave my keys where did you leave my keys it is a slightly different meaning in those two deliveries and finally volume i can get really excited by using volume sorry about that if i startled anybody or i can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet some people broadcast the whole time try not to do that that is called sodcasting. imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately not nice of course where this all comes into play most of all is when you have got something really important to do it might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people it might be proposing raising marriage asking for a raise a wedding speech whatever it is if it is really important you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it is going to work on and no engine works well without being warmed up warm up your voice actually let me show you how to do that would you all like to stand up for a moment i am going to show you the six vocal warmup exercises that i do before every talk i ever do anytime you are going to talk to anybody important do these first arms up deep breath in and sigh out like that one more time very good now we are going to warm up our lips and we are going to go bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop very good and now just like when you were a kids now your lips should be coming alive we are going to do the tongue next with exaggerated law law law law law law law law law law beautiful you are getting really good at this and then roll an re that is like champagne for the tongue finally and if i can only do one the pros call this the siren it is really good it starts with we and goes to or the we is high the or is low so you got we oh we fantastic give yourselves a round of applause take a seat thank you next next time you speak do those in advanced now let me just put this in context to close this is a serious point here this is where we are now right we speak not very well into people who simply are not listening in an environment that is all about noise and bad acoustics i have talked about that on this stage in different phases what would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who are listening consciously in environments which were actually fit for purpose or to make that a bit larger that a bit larger what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sounds that would be a world that does sound beautiful and one where understanding would be the norm and that is an idea worth spreading thank you thank you,sultan treasure,how to speak so that people want to listen
"so in college i was a government major which means i had to write a lot of papers now when a normal student writes a paper they might spread the work out a little like this so you know you get started maybe a little slowly but you get enough done in the first week that with some heavier days later on everything gets done and things stay civil and i would want to do that like that that would be the plan i would have it all ready to got but then actually the paper would come along and then i would do this and that would happen every single paper but then came my 90 page senior thesis a paper you are supposed to spend a year on i knew for a paper like that my normal workflow was not an option it was way too big a project so i planned things out and i decided it had to go something like this this is how the year would got so i would start off light and i would bump it up in the middle months and then at the end i would kick it up into high gears just like a little staircase how hard can it be to just walk up the stairs no big deal right but then the funniest thing happened those first few months they came and went and i could not quite do stuff so we had an awesome new revised plan and then but then those middle months actually went by and i did not really write words and so we were here and then two months turned into one months which turned into two weeks and one day i woke up with three days until the deadline still not having written a word and so i did the only thing i could i wrote 90 pages over 72 hours pulling not one but two all'-nighters. humans are not supposed to pull two all'-nighters. sprinted across campus dove in slow motion and got it in just at the deadline i thought that was the end of everything but a week later i get a call it is the school and they say is this him urban and i say yeah and they say we need to talk about your thesis and i say okay and they say it is the best one we have ever seen that did not happen it was a very very bad thesis i just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought this guy is amazing not not it was very very bad anyway today i am a writer blogger guys i write the blog wait but why and a couple of years ago i decided to write about procrastination my behavior has always perplexed the non procrastinators around me and i wanted to explain to the non procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators and why we are the way we are now i had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people and to test this i found an mi lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non procrastinator and so i could compare them and i actually brought them here to show you today and i want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference and i know that if you are not a trained brain expert it is not that obvious but just take a look okay so here's the brain of a non procrastinator now here's my brain there is a difference both brains have a rational decision maker in them but the procrastinator's brain also has an instant gratification monkey now what does this mean for the procrastinator well it means everything's fine until this happens so the rational decision maker will make the rational decision to do something productive but the monkey does not like that plan so he actually takes the wheel and he says actually let us read the entire wikipedia page of the nancy kerrigan, tana handing scandal because i just remember that that happened then then we are going to go over to the fridge we are going to see if there is anything new in there since 10 minutes ago after that we are going to go on a couture spiral that starts with videos of richer fireman talking about magnets and ends much much later with us watching interviews with just beer's mom all of that is going to take a while so we are not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today sorry now what is going on here the instant gratification monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel he lives entirely in the present moment he has no memory of the past no knowledge of the future and he only cares about two things easy and fun now in the animal world that works fine if you are a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things you are a huge success and to the monkey humans are just another animal species he has to keep well'-slept, well'-fed, and propagating into the next generation which in tribal times might have worked okay but if you have not noticed now we are not in tribal times we are in an advanced civilization and the monkey does not know what that is which is why we have another guy in our brain the rational decision maker who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do we can visualize the future we can see the big picture we can make long term plans and he wants to take all of that into account and he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now now sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun like when you are having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well or in leisure time that is why there is an overlap sometimes they agree but other times it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant for the sake of the big picture and that is when we have a conflict and for the procrastinator that conflict to end a certain way every time leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone an easy and fun place that is entirely out of the makes sense circle i call it the dark playground now the dark playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well it is where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening the fun you have in the dark playground is not actually fun because it is completely unearned and the air is filled with guilty dread anxiety self'-hatred, all those good procrastinator feelings and the question is in this situation with the monkey behind the wheel how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone a less pleasant place but where really important things happen well it turns out that the procrastinator has a guardian angel someone who is always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments someone called the panic monster now the panic monster is dormant most of the time but he suddenly wakes up any time a deadline gets too close or there is danger of public embarrassment a career disaster or some other scary consequences and importantly he is the only thing that the monkey is terrified of now he became very relevant in my life pretty recently because the people of ted reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a ted talk now of course i said yes it is always been a dream of mine to have done a ted talk in the past but in the middle of all this excitement the rational decision maker seemed to have something else in his mind he was saying we clear on what we just accepted do we get what is going to be now happening one day in the future we need to sit down and work on this right now and the monkey said totally agree but also let us just open googly earth and let us zoom into the bottom of india like 200 feet above the ground we are going to scroll up two and a half hours till we get to the top of the country so we can get a better feel for india so that is what we did that day as six months turned into four and then two and then one the people of ted decided to release the speakers and i opened up the website and there was my face staring right back at me and guess who woke up so the panic monster starts losing his mind and a few seconds later the whole system's in mayhem and the monkey who remember he is terrified of the panic monster boom he is up the tree and finally the rational decision maker can take the wheel and i can start working on the talk now the panic monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinated behavior like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages and this entire situation with the three characters this is procrastinator's system it is not pretty but in the end it works and this is what i decided to write about on the blog just a couple of years ago now when i did i was amazed by the response literally thousands of emails came in from all different kinds of people from all over the world doing all different kinds of things these are people who are nurses and bankers and painters and engineers and lots and lots of pod students and they were all writing saying the same thing i have this problem too but what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails these people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives about what this monkey had done to them and i thought about this and i said if the procrastinator system works then what is going on why are all these people in such a dark place well it turns out that there is two kinds of procrastination everything i have talked about today the examples i have given they all have deadlines when there is deadlines the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the panic monster gets involved but there is a second procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline so if you wanted to have a career where you want to be a self starter something in the arts something entrepreneurial there is no deadlines on those things at first because nothing's happening at first not until you have gone out and done the hard work to get some momentum to get things going there is also all kinds of important things outside of your career that do not involve any deadlines like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that is not working now if procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the panic monster that is a problem because in all of these non deadlines situations the panic monster does not show up it is nothing to wake up for so the effects of procrastination they are not contained they just extend outward forever and it is this long term procrastination that is much less visible and much less talked about than the fun of your short term deadline based kind it is usually suffered quietly and privately and it can be the source of a huge amount of long term unhappiness and regret rights and i thought that is why these people are emailing and that is why they are in such a bad place it is not that they are cramming for some project it is that long term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator at times in their own lives the frustration was not that they could not achieve their dreams it is that they were not even able to start chasing them so i read these emails and i had a little bit of an epiphany that i do not think non procrastinators exist that is right i think all of you are procrastinators now you might not all be a mess like some of us and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines but remember the monkey's sneaky the biggest trick is when the deadlines are not there now i want to show you one last thing i call this a life calendar that is one box for every week of a 90 year life that is not that many boxes especially since we have already used a bunch of those so i think we need to all take a long hard look at that calendar we need to think about what we are really procrastinating on because everyone is procrastinating something in life we need to stay aware of the instant gratification monkey that is a job for all of us and because there is not that many boxes on there it is a job that should probably start today well maybe not today but you know sometime soon thank you",him

"you could say i had an unconventional childhood for a couple reasons i was born to jewfish avocado and citrus growers in rural southern californium my dad was a surgeon at our local hospital and my mom ran the ranch where we sold our fruit commercially and they rescued donkeys my early childhood was so beautiful strange and very privileged and you could say that i really had nothing to worry about until i did when i was three and my dad was 42, he was diagnosed with metastatic bone cancer and he was told he had six months to live he had his right leg amputated and he went in for chemo and radiation which in the early 1980s, for bone cancer was especially brutal and then miraculously he did not die first we got a years then we got two then we got five and then we got seven and then when i was eleven the cancer came back and stayed for good we lived between scans like that is how our time was meted out and we lived with the constant ticking clock of mortality we all have a clock like this it is just in my family we could hear ours all the time more often than not one of his scans turned up something back tumor here a neck tumor there his other knees and then he would go in for treatment and then he would come back to us it was a little bit like a sinister version of the giving tree only he was trading body parts for time with us and then as i mentioned when i was eleven really he found out this is what was going to kill him and quickly and that is when he decided that he was going to teach my brother and i all the skills we would need to know to survive without him and so while other kids were having play dates after school and riding their bikes my brother and i were in my dad's version of survival school and we were learning all kinds of things how to squish a man's eyeballs out if i was ever attacked all about the dewy decimal system i do not know why the role of nitrogen in soil health member nations of the united nations and so much more he was also doing a lot of things to be present for us after he died so things like becoming a beekeeper and putting away enough honey that he knew would not spoil so that we would have it for decades or planting trees around the ranch that would shade and feed us after he was gone or even though i was only twelve at this point he started a coop of doves and put my brother in charge so that he would let them go at my wedding someday throughout it all i knew he was suffering and often in terrible pain even though he really did not like to talk about it and he always used to say that when he could not enjoy life with me my brother and my mom he would die and i took this at face value until one afternoon when i was 16, i went into their medicine cabinet looking for something and i found an unmarked pill bottle with dosage instructions and i just knew it was a terminal prescription it was right to die medication before it was legal i was not made i immediately understood what he had been saying all those years and that he had a plan that there was a level of pain and suffering that he was not willing to experience and i did not say anything to anybody just put it back and left and then six months later we were on the phone and we got into a terrible fight it was so stupid it was about me not wanting to do my college applications and i was so angry and i hung up on him without saying goodbye and without saying i loved him i did not know it but he was about to take his medication and i think when it came down to it saying goodbye to me was just too impossible by the time i got home he was unconscious and i would never hear his voice again i dealt with his death by doubling down on the things he wanted for me i chased academic honors like a drug i played not one but two division one college sports i wrote a book i got my pod and then in my mid thirties i realized i was just completely exhausted i had been living my entire adult life in a way to prove to myself that i was good because someone who is good is not someone who hangs up on her dying dad i was using achievement and all of the shiny things that come along with it as a way of anesthetizing my own bad feelings of shame regret and fear those feelings were so big i worried that if i let myself feel them for even a minutes i would never ever feel anything else again but you cannot kill negative feelings sadly with work and avoidance and mine came back with a jolt on the outside i was successful and thriving and on the inside i was anxious terrified and questioning my worth by avoiding all of the negative feelings i was muting the fantastic ones too i was so scared about missing out and losing more of the best things in life joy awe love wonderland that i could not even let myself experience them i needed to find a new way to be i wanted to find a new way to be so i did a bunch of stuff i interviewed a ton of grief specialists and therapists and i even went out into the wilderness with no food and no tent to do the thing that scared me most which was to be alone with my own thoughts and feelings and absolutely nothing to distract me from them i learned i can go about five days without eating about a week without talking to anyone and forever without checking my phone but what hit me the hardest was becoming a volunteer at a grief support organization for kids so many of them thought they were bad too they would been out of the room playing when their mom died or they would said something in anger to an ill parent that they regretted and i could so clearly see that the painful things that happened to these kids were not their fault for the first time i was able to see that that was probably true for me too by blaming themselves the kids were making their losses make sense even though it hurt to blame themselves it gave them a reason for the terrible thing that happened like losing someone they love for no reason at all maybe some of you can related often when we feel difficult things we blame ourselves because it is easier than admitting we have no control that is what i had been doing for the 25 years since my dad died but just because you feel guilt and shame does not mean you did something wrong just because you feel regret does not necessarily mean you should have acted differently it sounds very simple and it is very hard to accept but life is nothing except one long sushi conveyor belt of things that are going to test you and teach you at the same time i know this because first i lost my dad but then we lost our family home to wildfire the house and everything in it burned including almost everything that my dad had worked so hard hard to do and leave for us after he died and yet in one small wooden shed that i do not know how this was spared by the fire behind a bunch of old farming equipment we found a couple five gallon plastic buckets of my dad's honey he would harvested it more than 30 years earlier and it was still perfect the ancient egyptians used honey as a sweetener and also as a natural antibiotics on one papyrus it was written that when the sun god cried his tears fell to earth and became bees that made honey for the people life from grief pain into sweetness sorrow into medicine two years after the fire i lost my mom also to cancer but quickly this time she chose right to die too which was legal now and because of the experience we would had with my dad we vowed that this time would be totally different no one would be left wondering if they messed up or if she knew how much she meant to them so we had a living memorial service for her and we each took turns telling her how much she meant to us and she said the same thing back it was so beautiful and it also really hurt i think if you can swing it everyone deserves the chance to say goodbye what i know now and what i wish i could tell my younger self is that you cannot have joy without pain you cannot have resilience without challenges happiness without sadness or bravery without fear these things are not opposites they are partners there is no such thing as happily ever after i am sorry there is only sadly happy and happily sad and that is enough it is more than enough honestly i like to think that before we enter this world we are asked to sign a kind of cosmic release form acknowledging the extreme risk it is to care deeply about anyone or anything or any place i imagine it goes something like this i hereby acknowledge that in exchange for the chance to live i must accept both pain and pleasure joy and sorrow often at the exact same time this is the ticket price for the chance that is to live it is never too late to sign it thank you",laurel boatman,lessons from my fatherâs final days
"his my name is cameroon russell. and for the last little while i have been a model actually for ten years and i feel like there is an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because i should not have worn this dress so luckily i brought an outfit change this is the first outfit change on the ted stage so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it is good i think if some of the women were really horrified when i came out you do not have to tell me now but i will find out later on twitter i would also note that i am quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds not everybody gets to do that these heels are very uncomfortable so good thing i was not going to wear them the worst part is putting this sweater over my head because that is when you all laugh at me so do not do anything while it is over my head all right so why did i do that that was awkward well hopefully not as awkward as that picture image is powerful but also image is superficial i just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds and in this picture i had actually never had a boyfriend in real life i was totally uncomfortable and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy's hair and of course barring surgery or the fake tan that i got two days ago for work there is very little that we can do to transform how we look and how we look though it is superficial and immutable has a huge impact on our lives so today for me being fearless means being honest and i am on this stage because i am a model i am on this stage because i am a pretty white woman in my industry we call that a sexy girl and i am going to answer the questions that people always ask me but with an honest twist so the first question is how do you become a model and i always i would say i was scouted but that means nothing the real way that i became a model is i won a genetic lottery and i am the recipient of a legacy and maybe you are wondering what is a legacy well for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we are biologically programmed to admire but also as tall slender figures and femininity and white skin and this is a legacy that was built for me and it is a legacy that i have been cashing out on and i know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point and maybe there are some fashionistas who are like wait anomie trap join smalls you went and first i commend you on your model knowledge very impressive but unfortunately i have to inform you that in 2007, a very inspired nu pod student counted all the models on the runway every single one that was hired and of the 660 77 models that were hired only 27 or less than i were non'-white. the next question people always ask me is can i be a model when i grow up and the first answer is i do not know they do not put me in charge of that but the second answer and what i really want to say to these little girls is why you can be anything you could be the president of the united states or the inventor of the next internet or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet which would be awesome because you would be the first one if after this amazing list they still are like not not cameroon i want to be a model well then i say be my boss because i am not in charge of anything and you could be the editor in chief of america vogue or the coo of him or the next seven meisell. saying that you want to be a model when when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the powerball when you grow up it is out of your control and it is awesome and it is not a career path i will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons it can just be distilled right into right now so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there like a nice his and the client says cameroon we want a walking shot well then this light goes first nice and long this arm goes back this arm goes forward the head is at three quarters and you you just go back and forth just do that and then you look back at your imaginary friends 300, 400, 500 times it will look something like this hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle i do not know what happened there unfortunately after you have gone to school and you have a resume and you have done a few jobs you cannot say anything anymore so if you say you want to be the president of the united states but your resume reads underwear model 10 years people give you a funny look the next question people always ask me is do they retouch all the photos and yeah they pretty much retouch all the photos but that is only a small component of what is happening this picture is the very first picture that i ever took and it is also the very first time that i had worn a bikini and i did not even have my period yet i know we are getting personal but i was a young girl this is what i looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier here's me on the same day as this shoot my friend got to come with me here's me at a slumber party a few days before i shot french vogue here's me on the soccer team and in v magazine and here's me today and i hope what you are seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me they are constructions and they are constructions by professionals by hairstyles and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre'-production, and post'-production. and they build this that is not me okay so the next question people always ask me is do you get free stuff i do i have too many maiden shields which i never get to wear except for earlier but the free stuff that i get is the free stuff that i get in real life and that is what we do not like to talk about i grew up in cambridge, and one time i went into a store and i forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free when i was a teenagers i was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran around and of course we got pulled over and all it took was a sorry officer and we were on our way and i got these free things because of how i look not who i am and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are i live in new york and last years of the 140,000 teenagers that were sop and frisked 86 % of them were black and latino and most of them were young men and there are only 177,000 young black and latino men in new york so for them it is not a question of will i get stopped but how many times will i get stopped when will i get stopped when i was researching this talk i found out that of the 13'-year'-old girls in the united states 53% do not like their bodies and that number goes to 78 % by the time that they are 17. so the last question people ask me is what is it like to be a model and i think the answer that they are looking for is if you you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair you will be so happy and fabulous and when we are backstage we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that we say it is really amazing to travel and it is amazing to get to work with creative inspired passionate people and those things are true but they are only one half of the story because the thing that we never say on camera that i have never said on camera is i am insecure and i am insecure because i have to think about what i look like every day and if you ever are wondering if i have thinner thighs and shinier hair will i be happier you just need to meet a group of models because they have the thinnest thighs and the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes and they are the most physically insecure women probably on the planet so when i was writing this talk i found it very difficult to strike an honest balance because on the one hands i felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say look i have received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with and it does not always make me happy but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when i am one of the biggest beneficiaries but i am also happy and honored to be up here and i think that it is great i got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and i would had more agency in my career because maybe then i would not tell the story of how i got my first job or maybe i would not tell the story of how i paid for college which seems so important right now if there is a takeaway to this talk i hope it is that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures okay thank you",cameroon mussels,looks are not everything believe me i am a model
"i love learning foreign languages in fact i love it so much that i like to learn a new language every two years currently working on my eighth one when people find it out about me they always ask me how do you do that what is your secret and to be honest for many years my answer it would be i do not know i simply love learning languages but people were never happy with that answer they wanted to know why they are spending years trying to learn even one language never achieving fluency and here i come learning one language after another they wanted to know the secret of polyglots people who speak a lot of languages and that made me wonder too how do actually other polyglots do it what do we have in common and what is it that enables us to learn languages so much faster than other people i decided to meet other people like me and find it out the best place to meet a lot of polyglots is an event where hundreds of language lovers meet in one place to practice their languages there are several of such polyglot events organized all around the world and so i ready to go there and ask polyglots about the methods that they used and so i met benny from ireland who told me that his method is to start speaking from day one he learns a few phrases from a travel phrasebook and goes to meet native speakers and starts having conversations with them right away he does not mind making even 200 mistakes a day because that is how he learns based on the feedback and the best thing is he does not even need to travel a lot today because you can easily have conversations with native speakers from the comfort of your living room using websites i also met lucks from brazil who had a really interesting method to learn russia he simply added a hundred random russia speakers on slype as friends and then seriously and then he opened a chat window with one of them and wrote hi in russia and the person replied his how are you lucks copied this and put it into a text window with another person and the person replied i am fine thank you and how are you lucks copied this back to the first person and in this way he had two strangers have a conversation with each other without knowing about it and soon he would start typing himself because he had so many of these conversations that he figured out how the russia conversation usually starts what an ingenious method right and then i met polyglots who always start by imitating sounds of the language and others who always learn the 500 most frequent words of the language and yet others who always start by reading about the grammar if i asked a hundred different polyglots i heard a hundred different approaches to learning languages everybody seems to have a unique way how they learn a language and yet we all come to the same result of speaking our own languages fluently and as i was listening to these polyglots telling me about their methods it suddenly dawned on me the one thing we all have in common is that we simply found ways how to enjoy the language learning process all of these polyglots were talking about language learning as if it was great fun you should have seen their faces when they were showing me their colorful grammar charts and their carefully handmade flashcards and their statistics about learning they are very popular using apes or even how they love to cook based on recipes in a foreign language all of them use different methods but they always make sure it is something that they personally enjoy i realized that this is actually how i learn languages myself when i was learning spanish, i was bored with the text in the textbook i mean who wants to read about lose asking about the directions to the train station right i wanted to read harry potter instead because that was my favorite book as a child and i had read it many times so i got the punish translation of harry potter and started reading and sure enough i did not understand almost anything at the beginning but i kept on reading because i loved the book and by the end of the book i was able to follow it almost without any problems and the same thing happened when i was learning german i decided to watch friends my favorite sitcom in german and again at the beginning it was all just gibberish i did not know where one word finished and another one started but i kept on watching every day because it is friends i can watch it in any language i i love it so much and after the second or third season seriously the dialog started to make sense i only realized this after meeting other polyglots we are no geniuses and we have no shortcut to learning languages we simply found ways how to enjoy the process how to turn language learning from a boring school subject into a pleasant activity which you do not mind doing every day if you do not like writing words down on paper you can always type them in an happy if you do not listening to boring textbook material or find interesting content on couture or in podcast for any language if you are a more introverted person and you can imagine speaking to native speakers right away you can apply the method of self'-talk. you can talk to yourself in the comfort of your room describing your plans for the weekend how your day has been or even take a random picture from your phone and describe the picture to your imaginary friend this is how polyglots learn languages and the best news is it is available to anyone who is willing to take the learning into their own hands so meeting other polyglots helped me realize that it is really crucial to find enjoyment in the process of learning languages but also that joy in itself is not enough if you want to achieve fluency in a foreign language you will also need to apply three more principles first of all you will need effective methods if you try to memorize a list of words for a test tomorrow the words will be stored in your short term memory and you will forget them after a few days if you however want to keep words long terms you need to revise them in the course of a few days repeatedly using the so'-called space repetition you can use apes which are based on this system such as anti or memrise, or you can write lists of words in a notebook using the goldfish method which is also very popular with many polyglots if you are not sure which methods are effective and what is available out there just check out polyglots couture channels and websites and get inspiration from them if it works for them it will most probably work for you too the third principle to follow is to create a system in your learning we are all very busy and no one really has time to learn a language today but we can create that time if we just plan a bit ahead can you wake up 15 minutes earlier than you normally do or that would be the perfect time to revise some vocabulary can you listen to a podcast on your way to work while driving or that would be great to get some listening experience there are so many things we can do without even planning that extra time such as listening to podcast on our way to work or doing our household chores the important thing is to create a plan in the learning i will practice speaking every tuesday and thursday with a friend for 20 minutes i will listen to a couture video while having breakfast if you create a system in your learning you do not need to find that extra time because it will become a part of your everyday life and finally if you want to learn a language fluently you need also a bit of patience it is not possible to learn a language within two months but it is definitely possible to make a visible improvement in two months if you learn in small chunks every day in a way to enjoy and there is nothing that motivates us more than our own success i vividly remember the moment when i understood the first joke in german when watching friends i was so happy and motivated that i just kept on watching that day two more episodes and as i kept watching i had more and more of those moments of understanding these little victories and step by step i got to a level where i could use the language freely and fluently to express anything and this is a wonderful feeling i cannot get enough of that feeling and that is why i learn a language every two years so this is the whole polyglot secret find effective methods which you can use systematically over the period of some time in a way which you enjoy and this is how polyglots learn languages within months not years now some of you may be thinking that is all very nice to enjoy language learning but is not the real secret that you polyglots are just super talented and most of us are not well there is one thing i have not told you about benny and lucks benny had 11 years of iris gallic and five years of german at school could not speak them at all when graduating up to the age of 21, he thought he did not have the language gene and he could not speak another language",media macho,the secrets of learning a new language
"so recently i found myself in front of an audience of 200 marketing professionals i was giving a presentation about how the future of presentation is going to look like how we create presentations how we build them but before me was this great speaker she used to be a member of a parliament in finland but nowadays she had her own advertising agency she was talking about how to brand people how to build brand images around individuals she used a lot of images her first image was what she considered to be the best branding message of all time it was about jess christy this was it is a perfect brand for religion for god who could be unfair but with jess you would know that he would forgive sins so what followed after jess was well you got to decided he was talking about mat dinukanin, another iconic person in finish history a ski jumper who well later on in his career here they did something else as well these sportsmen have this great karma around them it is easy to brand them but sometimes as she was telling it is hard to keep that brand positive so tiger woods and her message was that even the greatest brand can wear out so while she was delivering this presentation i was not actually listening to her message i was looking at the images she used just like the best presenters of this time she was using not bullet points to read through the audience but images we live in a very visual era where we use a lot of images in our communication we use them in our blogs we use them in our presentation we use them in our reports it is a very visual era so i wanted to know where this great presenter was getting her images so while she was delivering the presentation i went online went to googly to find out it turns out that she had done exactly the same her images of tiger woods did not come from her camera they actually came from googly images so result number five exactly the same image when it came to math nukaren, it was actually buried it was the first image that she used so i bet that the jess did not come from her heart it came from googly as well now there is this is how people make presentations these days but how many of you have ripped images or taken images from googly images yeah so i guess that is the usual way of doing business usual way of creating presentations so my claim is that it is not the casa or bitching that are the biggest software or applications used to do piracy it is actually the powerpoints, the keynotes even our blogs but nobody actually cares so should we care of course we should there is a certain irony in this story because this member of parliament an ex'-member of parliament was actually among the group of people who were setting up a new copyright legislation in finland that copyright legislation made it actually a criminal to copy these images and publicly perform them in a commercial setting actually this same legislation that she was setting up could have taken her to a prison for two years and it could probably take many of you guys too nobody cares i think we should start caring and it is not like we do not have alternatives creative commons is a licensing system which was launched in 2001. it enables authors enables photographers enables composers writers to tell other people that you are free to use my work as long as you respect some rights that i have set up so for example wikimedia commons alone has over 10 million images which are licensed either with creative commons licenses or are in public domain or if you need more images there is flicker which holds 200 million imagine that 200 million photos which are licensed with credit comes licenses so some of these licenses only require you to do the attribution to give credit to the author you can do whatever you want with the image you can crop it you can build upon it you can use it you can publicly perform it no royalties have to be paid but you have to give credit to the author so how do you give credit to the author well as i said this is a legal it is a license it is a legal documents and legal documents tend to look like this this is the attribution clause in that five'-pages long license so many of you who have bumped into licenses like this feel pretty much like this after reading them so in order to get the license in order not to infringe that license you need to actually follow all the steps describe this documents so how do you do that so let us take an example i am creating a presentation and i need to find an image of a kids so first i would have to leave my pourpoint software which i use to create these presentations i would have to find a source where these images are find a perfect image this is where we jump in so i found this image yesterday of a kids and it is licensed with creative commons license i can use it as long as i tell who the author of the image was and it is... first i i would actually have to get it from flick which is somewhat difficult nowadays to my presentation so here we are next i would find out the name of the author that is something that the license requires and copy that to my presentation then i would go find the name of the image and in this case it is the img_0374. so i will attach that to my presentation as well next thing there is a requirement to add the license term so that other people who see my presentation would know that this is creative commons license it is quite fair i got it for free i should let other people know that they can do it as well so on a flick page there is not actually a curl that is required to be put on my presentation so i would have to click the some rights reserved logo there or link and then copy that from there this person who decided to share this image has also said that you can buy additional rights through petty images actually there is additional rights available and the license requires you to add that information as well so i would copy that information put it on my slide and then it would start looking like this now i wanted to... you can pretty much see that half of the slide is now goes to the attribution so i actually will have to reduce the size of the image so if i do that it will be considered derivative work and i would have to also mention that i have used this work in a modified way so that is a lot that is a lot that took me a minute or two and i am a a professional imagine by the time you have a presentation which has 50 slides and you repeat this process going back and forward back and forward 50 times you are starting to look like this so people really do not want to infringe copyrights they want to respect the licenses and we are seeing a lot of people trying to do that online it is just way too difficult so that is why we were seeing in our research that people are failing in this even if they are trying we did a survey with slideshare. we went through their 50 feature presentation which had views of tens of thousands and we examined how they used images a lot of them actually half of them used images from goggles we found a way to figure that out ten of those 50 used creative commons images none of those 10 presentation used the images correctly there was even a presentation there which was advising people how to use creative commons licensed images and even that failed in the attribution part and the way that licenses are built is that even if you fail in one of these attribution things you you lose the license the license is terminated so you are actually infringing as much as you would if you took the images from googly images so people are failing failing hardly imagine a world where this failing would not be an option imagine if the software did this for you imagine if it would be easier to do things legally to use images and not worry about attribution not reading that five'-page license so this is what we imagined we got some help from our friends at googly through their googly summer of code project so we designed a system that automates most of this make sure that your presentation are created legally so we created a software software this is a plugin for powerpoint, where you can actually... where you can actually... let us got actually actually actually where you can do the searches without leaving the powerpoint. you can search for images it will go out and find images which are creative commons licensed you can review them before select the one that you really want and attach that to your presentation the software really takes care of the attribution part it creates a slide to the end of the presentation so every time you add a image to your presentation it will do the attribution automatically so who is interested who would like to use this system so every time i do this presentation people come to ask we are going to get this so this would be the attribution slide of my presentation i was using this to build this presentation so as you can probably see it is not quite ready actually i might be infringing in this process as well it is missing some of the key parts there that is because it was created by a student and it is not quite done so we have a github web page you can help us to take take this to a level where you can distribute it where all of you could start using it if you have some gifts in software development but we did not stop here we decided to look at videos videos are a special media which unfortunately for amateurs have been really hard so if you look at youtube, there is two kinds of videos it is the one with the talking head the other one is with the remix of professional content well the third one is like amateur videos of your brother's wedding but then there is a certain category of creativity which is shown there which has demanded a lot of attention wish master i i started the presentation by talking about the visual age this is a storytelling it is a storytelling using audio using music and combining that with visuals and this presentation was created by tools which are not designed for that it was created with microdot paint and windows moviemaker. so very rough tools however with those tools this person this individual this amateur managed to create 11 million views that is a lot of demand people like this and they have created even more videos which mimic the message that made in this video so we actually need tools for people it is not just access to the media it is tools to modify them so we decided that okay so we might figure a way to do this with powerpoint, with presentations can we do this same with video and we did this is a software we created a year ago it is a web service code monkey have boring meeting boring manager's you can see there is a video playing a music playing in the background at the same time the user can insert tag words and we match those tag words with matching images this is a real'-time video'-creating system code monkey fake baby manager want to write goddamn login page himself code monkey not saying out loud code monkey not crazy just grow the code gold mucky like photos code monkey like ballast not to do code monkey very simple man a big warm fuzzy secret heart gold mucky like you gold mucky like you as a results you would get a timeline which would include all these images that match your message it does not have to be music video it can be also a presentation we are using it for a coursework here and you can easily modify the images change them you can replace the keywords you have set you can tweak the timings there the point being that this idea of using visuals in our daily communication is part of our visual era we as users we need to demand that from our software we do not want to go back and forward back and forward or risk the infringement we want software that does that for us that automates that that help us to make it legal we as designers we have to take these lessons and we can actually integrate them in most of the creative software because this is what people in the creative era demand and this is what we owe them and this is what we should give them thank you",hero hietanen,creative commons and the

"what keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life if you were going to invest now in your future best self where would you put your time and your energy there was a recent survey of millennial asking them what their most important life goals were and over 80 % said that a major life goal for them was to get rich and another 50 % of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous and we are constantly told to lean in to work to push harder and achieve more we are given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them those pictures are almost impossible to get most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but 2020. we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative but what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study many people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy we did that the hazard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that is ever been done for 75 years we have tracked the lives of 724 men year after years asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball further down the field but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived about 60 of our original 724 men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s. and we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men and i am the fourth director of the study since 1938, we have tracked the lives of two groups of men the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at hazard college they all finished college during world war i and then most went off to serve in the war and the second group that we have followed was a group of boys from button's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boson of the 1930s. most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed they were given medical exams we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top and some made that journey in the opposite direction the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today 75 years later telling you that the study still continues every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives many of the inner city boson men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just is not that interesting the hazard men never ask that question to get the clearest picture of these lives we do not just send them questionnaires we interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records from their doctors we draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said it is about time so what have we learned what are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we have generated on these lives well the lessons are not about wealth or fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get from this 75 year study is this good relationships keep us happier and healthier period we have learned three big lessons about relationships the first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier they are physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five america will report that they are lonely and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that it is not just the number of friends you have and it is not whether or not you are in a committed relationship but it is the quality of your close relationships that matters it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health high conflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective once we had followed our men all all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who was not and when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it was not their middle'-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old it was how satisfied they were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men and women reported in their is that on the days when they had more physical pain their moods stayed just as happy but the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain and the third big lesson that we learn about relationships on our health is that good relationships do not just protect our bodies they protect our brains it turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your is is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those people's memories stay sharper longer and the people in relationships where they feel they really cannot count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier memory decline and those good relationships they do not have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments did not take a toll on their memories so this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well'-being, this is wisdom that is as old as the hills why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore well we are human what we would really like is a quick fix something we can get that will make our lives good and keep them that way relationships are messy and they are complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends that is not sexy or glamorous it is also lifelong it never ends the people in our 75'-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates just like the millennial in that recent survey many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life but over and over over these 75 years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let us say you are 25 or you are 40 or you are 60. what might leaning into relationships even look like well the possibilities are practically endless it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member who you have not spoken to in years because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges i would like to close with a quote from mark twain more than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this there is not time so brief is life for bickering apologies heart burnings callings to account there is only time for loving but an instant so to speak for that the good life is built with good relationships thank you",robot malinger,what makes a good life lessons from the longest study on happiness
they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions but let us be honest do we really want to live in a world where we no longer maintain good intentions despite how negative and polarizing the world may seem at times many of us are still doing our best to maintain good intentions and positive interactions with each other and yet it can be frustrating sometimes to discover that something that we have said or done was still experienced by someone else as being offensive in response to this it is easy to get stuck in unhealthy extreme reactions such as strongly defending our character from perceived attacks only to realize that we have invalidated someone ease's feelings as a results or maybe we walk on eggshells or jump through every hoop possible to avoid offending anyone only to shame ourselves for making any mistakes or blame others for being too sensitive or maybe we just give up altogether concluding that you know you just cannot make anybody happy these days so why even try i do not know about you but that makes me scared because i do not know how we can maintain good intentions and positive interactions with each other if we are still going around living in fear of even unintentional offenses however i believe there is another way with your help i believe that we can maintain good intentions avoid the shame and blame game and even strengthen interactions with those who we encounter on a regular basis if that is of interest to you then i invite you to join me in learning to accept the inevitability of offense let me explain during my 20-plus years as a marriage and family therapist i have considered it an honor to be welcomed into the emotionally vulnerable spaces of new and seasoned couples through a variety of life circumstances and challenges during that time i have gained a great appreciation for four relationships strengthening principles that have helped not only the couples who i serve but also individual personal and professional relationships in all walks of life this first relationship-strengthening principle comes to life for me during one of my greatest professional joys which is when premarital engaged couples come into my office with a big smile on their face expressing how confident they are that they have found the one who they are to spend the rest of their life with primarily because they never disagree or argue with each other.(laughter) that is when i get a big smile on my face and i say that is awesome you guys are in the right place because i can help you fix that laughter they get confused just like that and they say wait what you want us to argue and fight with each other i reassuringly say not not but i do want you to know that you can disagree with each other and still love each other you can misunderstand each other and not conclude that maybe we were not meant to be for end the relationship prematurely due to seemingly irreconcilable offenses you see no matter how hard you try you will we will all offend someone at some point in time in our lives you know how i know because there is no absolute list of what is offensive and what is not what is offensive changes over time what is offensive to one person is perfectly fine to the next after all you cannot tell someone what they should be offended by and what they should not not only that but what is offensive is not always about an absolute list of right or wrongs but more often something that was said or done that reminds someone of a past hurt and makes them fear that future harm is on the way as a results if you find out that you have unintentionally offended someone i encourage you to resist the temptation to get stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense instead accept the inevitability of offense take the time to learn what made that offensive to the person in front of you and then make every reasonable effort to reduce the likelihood of repeating that offense moving forward the second relationship-strengthening principle that comes to life for me often does so when i see couples believing that if you do not know me by now you will never never know me laughter as if to convey that if you do not instantly understand and know everything about me then you must not truly love me but in reality i found that some of the best and long-lasting couple relationships are the ones that embrace not knowing everything that there is to know about a person instantly but actually appreciate the opportunity to keep the relationship fresh by learning new things about each other for years to come similarly in your personal and professional relationships i encourage you to acknowledge that you cannot know everything there is to know about everyone all the time or put more simply i encourage you to accept the inevitability of ignorance now i do not know about you but i grew up with ignorance as an insult synonymous with lack of intelligence but in reality ignorance is merely the lack of knowledge and if we are honest we all lack knowledge about a variety of different life circumstances including the things that many people find offensive however i do fair warn you if you are informed that you have unintentionally offended someone and the first thing out of your mouth is the justification for how you did not know that it was offensive it is emotionally reasonable for someone else to respond in frustration how could you not know everybody knows that that is offensive except there is nothing that everyone knows not only that but how did you not know that it was offensive maybe you were never taught by someone important to you that it was offensive maybe you never personally experienced the hurt that would have taught you that was offensive maybe you were never surrounded by people who experienced the hurt that would have taught you by witnessing that it was offensive how could you not know or how could you also know what makes this not just another insensitive defensive excuse is that we can learn to accept the inevitability of ignorance as a temporary state turning that accusation into an opportunity to reduce our ignorance by increasing our knowledge and using that knowledge to reduce the likelihood of the next offense moving forward the third relationship-strengthening principle comes to life for me when i see couples stuck in the reasonable yet futile search for perfect communication for while healthy communication is essential to a good relationship it is also perfectly reasonable for partners to use the same words but mean completely different things based on their family of origin and life experiences even before meeting each other this often results in partners getting stuck in a defensive battle protecting themselves from perceived threats that were never really attacks in the first place but unhealthily expressed pleas for understanding support and empathy similarly in your personal and professional relationships i encourage you to learn to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding for even our reasonable intentions can result in unintentionally negative impacts leading others to feel the need to protect themselves from us as a perceived threat but wait a minutes why would you be a perceived threat if all you have is good intentions well consider this for a moment consider the possibility that before their encounter with you they experienced nine times of someone else saying the exact same thing or doing the exact same thing that you did but after each of those times it was followed by a hurtful experience then you come along the tenth person to do or say that exact thing despite your reasonable intentions it is also reasonable for them to see the pattern and to fear similar harm from you it is because of this that if you find out that you have unintentionally offended someone i encourage you to resist the temptation of getting stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense and instead ask yourself am i really being attacked or have i simply reminded them of a past hurt and made them fear the future harm is on the way if that is even a remote possibility in your life i encourage you to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding and channel your efforts into the fourth relationship-strengthening strategy which is to learn to reassure the hurt person that you are not the threats that they fear that you are you see when my couples get stuck in a defensive battle protecting themselves from perceived threats and misrepresentations what turns things around is not more explanations and justifications it is instead when one or both partners can get to the point of saying i see better than i did before your past hurts i see the impact that they have had on your current unmet needs and i want to come alongside of you to help make your future better than your hurtful past similarly in your personal and professional relationships i encourage you to look for opportunities to reassure a hurt person that you are not the threat that they fear that you are how can you do this well it can start with a verbal acknowledgment of the limitations of your intentions recognizing that your intent does not always determine your impact but some of you even here may actually resent intentions but i find that many people do not actually resent intentions because they actually have a problem with good intentions but more often because people have received the gift of good intentions being offered instead of what they really need changed behavior you can separate yourself from these experiences by making sure that your verbal acknowledgment of reassurance is always followed by a meaningful behavioral change showing that your commitment is more than just words but action showing to make their future better than their hurtful past now i am not really here to tell you one more thing that you should already be doing but might not be doing not i am here to tell you what the next person who you unintentionally offend needs you to do they need you to accept the inevitability of offense getting stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense does less to help that person than your efforts to reduce the likelihood of the next offense they need you to accept the inevitability of ignorance you do not need to know everything about everyone all the time but you can accept what you do not know value what you do know and learn more one experience at a time they need you to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding acknowledging that your intent does not always determine your impact and they need you to reassure hurt persons that you are not the threat that they fear that you are you can do this with flexibility and openness to change but not change out of correction for being a bad person but change out of consideration for the welling of someone else you never know you might be the one in your environment to reduce the likelihood of the next misunderstanding-influenced divorce friendship breakup job resignation or even cultural cancellation all often influenced by unintentional offenses and just like my couples i want you to know that you do not have to live in fear of even unintentional offenses instead you can accept the inevitability of offense make every reasonable effort to reduce the frequency of those offenses and move forward repairing and strengthening every relationship you encounter thank you,lumber fisher,what to do when you offend someone
"so why is it the case that when we are feeling the most anxious uncomfortable socially awkward versions of ourselves when our hearts are pounding and our palms are sweating and we feel like crawling out of our skin are we also the most nice and often generic to the people around us i am a social psychologist and i have been studying the science of uncomfortable social interactions for over years so everything from new roommate relationships negotiations upward feedback with your boss to doctor patient-interactions, those moments where you need to break in and say yeah for the last minutes i actually have no idea what you were talking about can we maybe rewind a bit and to study these things i look at three main outcomes first i look at what people say the things we can control how friendly we are how much we complement one another how much we give gracious feedback second i look at the things that are tougher for us to control our nonverbal behaviors things like fidgeting avoiding eye contact playing with our hair doodling even even our tone of voice and then i look at the things that are impossible for us to control our under-the-skin responses our physiology our cardiovascular reactivity things like blood pressure heart rate these types of things that we often do not even really realize that we are feeling and the way i do this is by having people come into the lab and interact with each other in a bunch of different settings and i have them negotiate with each other i have them get acquainted with each other and often it is the case that in these interactions people are required to give some form of feedback to their partner tell them honestly what they are thinking or feeling come in with an offer for a negotiations tell them what they could have done better next time and i think we all kind of know what it feels like to be in one of these studies you might not know what it would really feel like to be in one of my studies there is a lot of equipment involved but we plug people up to all of these things to measure these under-the-skin responses we videotape them to capture those behaviors that i just mentioned now to get us all into this mindset of what it is like to feel awkward but maybe potentially a little bit nice i want you all to think about what was the last awkward interaction that you had oka so keep this thought in your mind you can think about it for a few moments because in a couple minutes i am actually going to randomly call on someone based on your seat to have you come up and share your story of what that moment felt like so before we do that i just want you all to kind of get a sense of the typical pattern that we see when people are engaging in these interactions so we bring them into the lab we hook them up to all this equipment and within moments within the first seconds we start to see those stress responses that i mentioned their heart rate goes up their blood pressure increases it does not take much to get people to start to feel anxious next we see it in those nonverbal behaviors they start to fidget they avoid eye contact they pull their chair a couple inches away from the person who is sitting next to them in an effort just to get a little bit more distance one of my favorite findings is in doctor-patient interactions uncomfortable doctors they look down at the chart more or they look more at the computer screen instead of making eye contact with those patients so let us all return to your awkward moment does everyone have an awkward moment in mind or thinking about one how many of you have increases in your heart rate maybe your palms are sweating you can start to feel yourself getting a little tingly just with the mere thought of being called upon today hey a few of you how many people would actually be excited about that opportunity not i oka same people laughter how many of you if i did call on you would walk up here you would grin through gritted teeth like this and you would do it even though you secretly hated me the whole time a few of you do not worry i am not going to actually do this this was all just a ruse to teach you a lesson which is in uncomfortable social interactions we often do not have a social script of what to do instead of telling people what we really think what we really feel we do the nice thing that makes us incredibly uncomfortable now one of my favorite findings illustrating this effect is in the context of negotiations i went to a major firm and i brought people together who were used to working with one another and we had them engage in a negotiations and at the end of it there was a winner and there was a loser so we said to the winner you know this is really a study about feedback and what we would like you to do is give some constructive feedback to the person who just lost what are some things that they could do better next time what are some potential missteps how many of you think that that is what they actually did they really followed our instructions oka nobody you can see where this is going what we found is that even when we are talking to someone who just lost a negotiation to us we tend to bend over backwards we say things like the way you made that really early offer and did not even ask for a counter that was amazing or it was so great how you did not even ask me anything about my side or what i was willing to kind of you know change on or be flexible on people layered on the compliments to someone who they just beat in a negotiations telling them how great they are so often these kinds of interactions that take the form of what ill call anxious niceness they involve a lot of compliments telling people what they do well in a very general nonspecific way but a lot of my work actually looks at what is it like to be on the receiving end of these types of interactions how do you feel when you interact with someone over and over again who is giving off these kinds of brittle smiles these are typically the kinds of facial expressions that we actually see from people kind of sneering a little bit of side eyes you know arms crossed these types of things after a lifetime of interacting with someone who engages in anxious niceness what we find is that most people on the receiving end are racial minorities they are disadvantaged group members they are the type of people that we are worried about appearing prejudiced in front of and that anxiety is regulated by being over-the-top nice to these folks we also find that these individuals tend to be more synchronized to and attentive to the how-we-say-it piece than the what-we-say part so in one study we had black and white america interact with each other in a cross-race interaction and we brought them into the lab and we measured the physiology of both partners what this allowed us to do is capture the degree to which people stress those under-the-skin responses can actually be caught by their partners and what we expected to find is that the black participants would become more synchronized physiologically to those whites they would be more attuned to those kind of nonverbal signals of anxiety and that is exactly what we found the more anxious those white participants appeared the more they fidgeted the more they avoided eye contact even the higher their cortisol reactivity indicating some real deep kind of under-the-skin stress response the more those black participants became linked up to them over time and i think this finding is a little bit terrifying i think it means that we often think of our own stress and our own physiology as independent of the people we interact with but our bodies are not always our own our physiology is not always our own and if you spend a lifetime interacting with people who are so nice to you in an effort to control their anxiety you could potentially catch that stress it could negatively affect your bodies now often what we find is the type of feedback that people are actually getting is not always super direct sometimes it is a little bit patronizing so you could probably see where i am going with this having over-the-top positive nice feedback can harm your performance it can make it very difficult for you to climb up difficult to kind of know where you stand what you should do better what you should stop doing but can also damage people in ways that we often do not think about it can affect their reputations outside of the interaction context so imagine the case that you are one of these people who loves giving this general nice feedback and you have someone who works for you and a recruiter calls maybe a past employee a recruiter calls you or someone asks you for a letter of recommendation the kinds of things you are going to put are going to be like they are are real team player they have great energy at work generic things yes they are nice but they are not very telling about what that person is really like and what we find is that the readers of these things at best think to themselves wow they must not really know this person at all i do not even know what this means at worst they think to themselves well they probably have some real opinions they are just afraid to share them so these kinds of general positive feedback tend to actually harm people's reputation when they are not backed up with real data so i think we have to then think about what is the solution to this problem is it the case that we should all just be meaner to each other in an effort to be more direct i do not think that is the case at all i think there are some things we can do and i am going to highlight three of them to improve the degree to which we give clear consistent feedback to people particularly in the workplace so first we need to ask ourselves the question how many people are on board with this niceness culture really there is a bit of a plural ignorance that goes on when we think about how nice we are to people at work what i have found is that for every one person who loves this kind of general generic nice feedback there is another person who feels like it is lazy who feels like it is not helpful and i actually learned this lesson the hard way from one of my students recently she was giving a practice talk in my lab and she spent weeks and weeks preparing it probably harder than anyone else i would ever seen on preparing a talk like this and then she went and gave it and she came back and i said how did the talk got did it go well she said it was terrible it was horrible it was the worst experience i said well what happened and she said all i got were a bunch of great jobs that was interesting and then some clap emesis from the people on zoom not a single person asked a tough question she said and i had this moment where i realized that positive feedback can come across as lazy feedback it can come across as disengaged feedback and so if we want to change this culture we actually need to first do a quick pulse of how many people are actually more interested in doing the tougher constructive forms of this type of feedback so you might be thinking to yourselves alright i might be on board with this idea of tough yet honest feedback so what should i do should i go to people and say alright do you want me to be ... nice or honest and useful?'"" not do not do this you will by and large get a lot of people telling you you know i actually just want to keep it nice that just feels a lot more comfortable for me what i learned in my work is that this process i have been talking about about giving anxious nice feedback is just as much about the feedback receiver as it is about the feedback giver people get into a bit of a dance with each other i give you nice feedback you kind of know it is is but you smile and say thank you and then you know go on your way it takes a lot to break that interpersonal cycle and to do that we have to think about how we actually want to frame our feedback to other people so instead of asking people should i be nice or honest and useful what i like to do is ask people can i give you feedback on a couple dimensions can we think about feedback as general versus specific another dimension would be can we think about things that you are doing well you should keep doing versus things that please stop and i will get in a moment to how we can actually frame that form of negative feedback so i think a lot of us are actually pretty decent at the positive general feedback right i love how timely you are but what does that mean it could mean that you are on time for meetings it could mean that you turn your work in on time it could mean it in a very global way of you sure managed to do a lot in five years or it could mean something so specific like it is so helpful that you send in your reports by pm, but i do not really want to comment on all those other kinds of forms of being timely and when we do the kind of general feedback that is negative the please stop we need it to be specific so kind of one of the more common forms of general negative feedback people get is you do not take enough initiative here how many of you have ever been told please take some more initiative i think most of us at some point in our lives have experienced this what does that mean does it mean i should speak up more in meetings does it mean i should be quicker on my email does it mean i should do your job without complaining about doing your job which is often what it actually means we have to break it down into the specifics and that could include things like do not wait for tom to ask if you found any errors before you say tomb i found some errors.'"" now an important piece here is what people should do instead often if we get to the stage where we are comfortable enough telling people i have a specific critical negative thing i want to tell you i please stop interrupting people you know not telling tom about the errors showing up five minutes late with coffee so i know what you were doing during those five minutes i we do not tend to replace them with anything but we know from our personal lives that replacing negative critical please stop behaviors is absolutely essential so i want to take you out of the workplace for a moment and we are going to go to the bedroom yes i said we are going to the bedroom so imagine it is the case that you just had sex with someone for the first time oka we are all there we have done a lot of tantalizing today and you turn to the person and you say those last three things you just did back there no good they are all bad did not like any of them they are going to look at you in shock and surprise and say well what should i do instead right and until we are ready to actually fire the person or kick them out of bed or fire them from our team we have to focus on those replacement behaviors what they should be doing instead and i think as we think through kind of scaling this type of feedback it can be very scary to make these types of change what i found is that cultures of anxious nice feedback are ingrained they are systemic they are deeply embedded in a community in the workplace in a team even in dyadic interpersonal relationships and so to break that cycle you have to start small you need to start neutral and by neutral i mean things that are not scary to hear critical feedback on you might be thinking to yourself what is some neutral feedback that you could give me at the end of my talk how about i would switch the order of the points on your talk or i would change the font these types of feedback are specific and so they are useful but they are not scary to deliver and they are not actually scary to received and what we find is that when people take these baby steps to work up to this type of feedback they are much less anxious in the delivery so those behaviors i opened with of people fidgeting engaging in what we call a brittle smile avoiding eye contact they actually go down and so do those stress responses when you know and you are anticipating giving this kind of feedback that is not going to sting and i think as you work through this i do not want to be a proponent of killing niceness entirely i think it is actually really important to put niceness in the delivery of your feedback and that can come across in a bunch of different ways it can come across as by showing you are engaged you listened you know what the person's actually trying to do you are aligned with their goals the first time i actually got this type of critical nice feedback was after a talk i gave and the person came up to me and she said can i give you some feedback and immediately my heart started pounding i am like oh great here we got no one likes hearing can i give you some feedback and she opened with three things that she thought i did well i really liked points one two and three you made in that talk they really resonated with me but you have this habit when you are concentrating of looking up and to the right and so you spent half the talk kind of staring at the ceiling or the exit sign in this case instead of making eye contact with the audience and it is distracting and it creates a distance so i thought a little bit about it with my eyes probably rolled up inside my head and i thought oka i can actually make that change it does not feel super scary and so i did i made that change and i thought about how she framed that feedback through this culture of niceness so i want to wish you all luck on your journey of trying to change culture of feedback killing anxious niceness and hopefully have some concrete steps to help you move forward thank you",tesla west,the problem with being too nice at work
"a few years ago i broke into my own house i had just driven home it was around midnight in the dead of mongrel winter i had been visiting my friend jiffy across town and the thermometer on the front porch read minus degrees i and do not bother asking if that is census or fahrenheit, minus is where the two scales meet i it was very cold and as i stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets i found i did not have my keys in fact i could see them through the window lying on the dining room table where i had left them so i quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows and they were locked tight i thought about calling a locksmith i at least i had my cellphone but at midnight it could take a while for a locksmith to show up and it was cold i could not go back to my friend jiff's house for the night because i had an early flight to rope the next morning and i needed to get my passport and my suitcase so desperate and freezing cold i found a large rock and i broke through the basement window cleared out the shards of glass i crawled through i found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening figuring that in the morning on the way to the airport i could call my contractor and ask him to fix it this was going to be expensive but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith so i figured under the circumstances i was coming out even now i am a neuroscientist by training and i know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress it releases cortisol that raises your heart rate it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking so the next morning when i woke up on too little sleep worrying about the hole in the window and a mental note that i had to call my contractor and the freezing temperatures and the meetings i had upcoming in europe, and you know with all the cortisol in my brain my thinking was cloudy but i did not know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy laughter and it was not until i got to the airport checking counter that i realized i did not have my passport laughter so i raced home in the snow and ice minutes got my passport raced back to the airport i made it just in time but they had given away my seat to someone else so i got stuck in the back of the plane next to the bathrooms in a seat that would not recline on an eight-hour flight well i had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep laughter and i started wondering are there things that i can do systems that i can put into place that will prevent bad things from happening or at least if bad things happen will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe so i started thinking about that but my thoughts did not crystallize until about a month later i was having dinner with my colleagues nanny kahneman, the noble prize winner and i somewhat embarrassed told him about having broken my window and you know forgotten my passport and nanny shared with me that he would been practicing something called prospective hindsight laughter it is something that he had gotten from the psychologist gay olein who had written about it a few years before also called the pre-mortem. now you all know what the postmortem is whenever there is a disaster a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong right well in the pre-mortem, nanny explained you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening or to minimize the damage so what i want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem. some of them are obvious some of them are not so obvious i will start with the obvious ones around the home designate a place for things that are easily lost now this sounds like common sense and it is but there is a lot of science to back this up based on the way our spatial memory works there is a structure in the brain called the hippocampus that evolved over tens of thousands of years to keep track of the locations of important things i where the well is where fish can be found that stand of fruit trees where the friendly and enemy tribes live the hippocampus is the part of the brain that in onion taxicab drivers becomes enlarged it is the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts and if you are wondering somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels and they could still find their nuts they were not using smell they were using the hippocampus this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things but it is really good for things that do not move around much not so good for things that move around so this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports so in the home designate a spot for your keys i a hook by the door maybe a decorative bowl for your passport a particular drawer for your reading glasses a particular table if you designate a spot and you are scrupulous about it your things will always be there when you look for them what about travel take a cell phone picture of your credit cards your driver's license your passport mail it to yourself so it is in the cloud if these things are lost or stolen you can facilitate replacement now these are some rather obvious things remember when you are under stress the brain releases cortisol cortisol is toxic and it causes cloudy thinking so part of the practice of the pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress you are not going to be at your best and you should put systems in place and there is perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you are confronted with a medical decision to make and at some point all of us are going to be in that position where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one to help them with a decision and so i want to talk about that and i am going to talk about a very particular medical condition but this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making, and indeed for financial decision-making, and social decision-making i any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts so suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says i just got your lab work back your cholesterol's a little high now you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease heart attack stroke and so you are thinking having high cholesterol is not the best thing and so the doctor says you know i would like to give you a drug that will help you lower your cholesterol a stating and you have probably heard of stations you know that they are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world today you probably even know people who take them and so you are thinking yeah give me the stating but there is a question you should ask at this point a statistic you should ask for that most doctors do not like talking about and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less it is for the number needed to treat now what is this the not it is the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped and you are thinking what kind of crazy statistic is that the number should be one my doctor would not prescribe something to me if it is not going to help but actually medical practice does not work that way and it is not the doctor's fault if it is anybody's fault it is the fault of scientists like me we have not figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough but glaxosmithkline estimates that percent of the drugs work in only to percent of the people so the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed stating what do you suppose it is how many people have to take it before one person is helped . this is according to research by research practitioners become groomsman and camera hartzband, independently confirmed by bloomberg.com. i ran through the numbers myself people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack stroke or other adverse event is prevented now you are probably thinking well oka one in chance of lowering my cholesterol why not dock give me the prescription anyway but you should ask at this point for another statistics and that is tell me about the side effects right so for this particular drug the side effects occur in five percent of the patients and they include terrible things i debilitating muscle and joint pain gastrointestinal distress i but now you are thinking five percent not very likely it is going to happen to me i will still take the drug but wait a minutes remember under stress you are not thinking clearly so think about how you are going to work through this ahead of time so you do not have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot people take the drug right one person's helped five percent of those have side effects that is people you are times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug now i am not saying whether you should take the station or not i am just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor medical ethics requires it it is part of the principle of informed consent you have the right to have access to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not now you might be thinking i have pulled this number out of the air for shock value but in fact it is rather typical this number needed to treat for the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of , removal of the prostate for cancer the number needed to treat is . that is right surgeries are done for every one person who is helped and the side effects in that case occur in percent of the patients they include impotence erectile dysfunction urinary incontinence rectal tearing fecal incontinence and if you are lucky and you are one of the percent who has these they will only last for a year or two so the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward you do not want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot and you also want to think about things like quality of life because you have a choice oftentimes do you i want a shorter life that is pain-free, or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end these are things to talk about and think about now with your family and your loved ones you might change your mind in the heat of the moment but at least you are practiced with this kind of thinking remember our brain under stress releases cortisol and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down there is an evolutionary reason for this face-to-face with a predator you do not need your digestive system or your libido or your immune system because if you are body is expending metabolism on those things and you do not react quickly you might become the lion's lunch and then none of those things matter unfortunately one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational logical thinking as nanny kahneman and his colleagues have shown so we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations i think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed we all are going to fail now and then the idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place getting back to that snowy night in montreal, when i got back from my trip i had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door with a key to the front door in it an easy to remember combination and i have to admit i still have piles of mail that have not been sorted and piles of emails that i have not gone through so i am not completely organized but i see organization as a gradual process and i am getting there thank you very much",dance

"ten nine eight seven - pressures are good - six five four three - valve timing nominal - two one we are good to got lift off 5,000 miles no excessive vibrations 10,000 miles temperatures are good 15,000 miles 17,000 miles - yes we are in outer space cheers applause that was me - an award-winning rocket scientist sitting in mission control i helped successfully launch discovery columbine atlantes and endeavor space shuttles i used ... thank you applause cheers i used mathematics and science to calculate the probability of catastrophic explosion within the space shuttle's flight in all i helped launch with a great team of people 28 spatial missions into outer space applause cheers now i can stand here and tell you how great it was to launch for the mission control i can tell you how it was like to sign off and authorize multimillion-dollar engine tests but i am not i can tell you how great it is to be an author and a to host now but i am not rather i am going to talk about you and me and what comes in our mind in the middle of challenges fear what have you always wanted to do in life do you want to be a multimillion-dollar business owner do you want to be the first in your family to graduate from college do you want to start a family for me i always wanted to be a rocket scientists but obstacle and roadblocks came into my path where i questioned whether or not i would be able to do it the truth is this if we do not have a way to reprogram our minds to overcome fear we will never be successful at our own specific missions in life but there is good news i have personally found i have personally devised a three-step method to overcome fear and reprogram the brain using three key decisions and i am going to share them with you today the first decision is this you must name and reject your fear you must name and reject your fear now the easiest way for me to tell you about all these three decisions is to take you back in my life and to share with you what happened with me so you have a better idea of how to use these three decisions and it started when i was six years old and i will never forget that day i went on a field trip to the jet propulsion laboratory and there it was wonderful i remember seeing these big engines and these jets and we went to their mission control room and it was amazing i saw these big to screens on the wall and these red plush chairs and i also saw pictures of men launching rockets and i said to myself i want to be just like those men now i am not quite sure if you have noticed i wear stilettos and skirts i am definitely a woman ... applause cheers and that did not stop me i wanted to be just like these men but obstacles came into my path now here i am 10 years old in the middle of a fifth-grade class and right next to me is a boy who is also 10, and he has been recruited into a gang he and i get into arguments quite regularly because frankly i do not know the power of my words at this age and he wears this ring on his finger that he files down so it acts just like a knife and so one day in a heated argument he takes this ring and he socks me right under my eyes now being a champion an olympian, i stand up to defend myself and everything goes blank i cannot see one thing i am later rushed to the hospital and i have five layers of stitches placed on my face and the surgeon tells me i am lucky had it been any higher i would have lost my eyes now i am pulled out of school for months where right next door there is a crack house and i see people getting high on the outside of my bedroom window and our mother has us sleep in the bed in a certain direction so if the bullets came through the house if it came through the walls it would hit our feet first and not our head so in the middle of downtown lot angels in poverty face disfigured and i want to be a rocket scientists next i am placed into another school where i fail algebra then i fail geometry then i go to a performing arts school and i fail chemistry then make a d in calculus ... then a blessing occurs there is this man - he is a teacher - and he says that if anybody wants help for their a calculus exam he would tutor them for free so i jump at this opportunity and i catch the bus two hours each way just to sit with his man for one hours and i remember looking at the information and i remember thinking wait i can get this i may not understand it now but i will i am not going to let failures stop me and that was the first time i learned to name and reject my fear it would be a beautiful story if i told you that i took the a calculus exam and passed it but not i failed it miserably laughter but what i learned is that process to invest in myself and others in education i took those skills and graduated at the age of 16 from high school and then later applied those skills to the university i attended where i tutored thousands of people in mathematics through educational group programs and i and other people learned to name and reject their fear and i fortunately was able to be one out of top five graduates out of a 6,500 graduating class you must name your fear and reject it applause the second decision is this you must reprogram your brain with different thoughts you must reprogram your brain with different thoughts you know how you have a computer and it may be infected with a virus you have to take the virus off the computer and reboot it so it operates correctly well our brains are the exact same way what we have to do is take the virus out which is called fear and i learned this my first couple of months working as a rocket scientists now i am going to share a secret with you when i first started in rocket science i was completely intimidated i remember going inside this room and there was around 200 people in this room and i remember looking around and i was the only woman and then i remember looking around again and everyone was at least 20 years older than i was and i was hearing all these words i did not know beads of sweat would come down my forehead as i was hearing some start rp-1, is i did not know what any of this was and that fear started coming into my brain again and i did not know whether or not i would be able to make a significant difference then a couple of weeks later i had my second epiphany i remember going into this room and then i realized wait i am educated and i work hard at everything i do i may not be able to make a significant difference now but i will so that is what i did i literally told myself i am going to make a big difference here and i found mentors to show me what some meant which was the space shuttle main engine the space shuttle main engine was huge i find out where every single duct line weld tube every valve was placed enough so that i was able to help redesign new engines and sit in mission control this work allowed me to become one of the youngest engineers of the years you must reprogram your brain with different thoughts and the last decision is this the last decision is this you must rebuild your brain you must rebuild the neurons in your brain by taking action now we have all been there we have had to lose weight we have had to get in shape and it is not enough to simply say all right i am going to get in shape and then you sit on your couch you have got to go to the gym you have got to climb those stairs you have got to get on a bike you have got to do something to activate your muscles so you lose weight well our brains are the exact same way the way that we exercise our brain is by taking action in direct opposition to our fear in every single one of these cases i learned something specific i and other people were suffering from what i have personally coined as ""mathphobia."" laughter mathphobia is a severe fear that happens in the reptilian part of the brain that shuts off the frontal brain lobes rendering someone completely paralyzed when it comes to problem-solving. anytime someone has fear the problem-solving is completely turned off but when we take action in direct opposition from our fear something amazing happens neuron transmitters are created and built within our brain turning off fear creating pathways to fire off our frontal brain lobes and when our frontal brain lobes fire off we are able to do great things and i recognized this after i left rocket science when i left rocket science i was offered a prestigious position for a banking institution only to recognize that i loved science and education far more so i left banking and i decided to be a partitive mathematics professor but when i did that the entire united states economy tanked nobody was hiring and here i was underemployed struggling to pay my bills and i almost let fear stop me again but this time i was armed with all these experiences and something different happened this time i remember sitting there thinking what am i going to do and then i had my latest realization wait i am talented if no one is hiring why not hire myself so that is what i did laughter i hired myself i created my own educational entertainment company first i created my website with all the cool different science technology engineering and math videos then what i did was form the company - specifically i had to find out the difference between an corporation and a c-corporation. next what i did is i hired tutors then i wrote a book now my team and i are creating educational to shows for network programming i did not know how to do any of this but in that process of learning to become a beginner again what i was doing is turning off the fear in my own head creating neuron transmitters in my own brain firing my frontal lobes allowing myself to be creative and creating opportunities so if there is one thing i want you to remember today it is this you can reprogram your brain to override fear if you name and reject your fear reprogram your brain with different thoughts and take action in direct opposition to your fear if you do all these three things guess what you can do anything you set your mind to even become a rocket scientists",olympia point,reprogramming your brain to overcome fear
i am here to help you do even more unzipping of your minds and of your hearts moxie clay came out here and challenged your expectations and i am going to ask you to unzip and let your expectations fall out and push them aside all together because they are holding you back expectations are those lists of things what are expectations we build up that tell us how things should be they keep us feeling safe and they also often prevent us from being fully present in our lives and from living to our highest potential so i am going to tell you about my journey away from expectation which also turned out to be a journey toward self empowerment and hope and then how it might apply to your relationships as well i first learned about the power of letting go of expectation on my journey back to my natural family my birth family i am adopted and my adoption is a fairly standard post world war two story in great brain my natural parents live next door to each other in a small town near the east coast of scotland and when they finished high school they went to the west of scotland to glasgow a whopping 38 miles away my father went to heathers story glasgow university my mother went to nursing school and when she became pregnant they decided they were going to get married but they were going to wait and tell their families when they went home on christian break so they expected to end that year by becoming a family that was remember 1966 what they got instead was a tearful break up outside my father's garage from my mother that was followed by a stay at a mothering home a daughter who left the hospital before she did a bill for my foster care and ultimately my adoption my father paid penance by working as a bricklayer for a year before he to university in edinburgh they never saw each other again whatever expectations they had were letting go of expectations shattered on top of that they were told that they should be grateful privileged that they had a chance to redeem themselves and move on this is all pretty standard stuff for that time in place and i am telling you this because i want to note that although my parents learned not to expect in the wake of our separation this is not the productive kind of letting go the kind of letting go that they learned is rooted in shame and in punishment there is not any hope in it it is about shutting down and what i would like us to do today is learn how to let go and open up so fast-forward 18 years from that tearful breakup in the garage my adoptive father my dad had made it clear that he would totally understand if i wanted to go and find my natural family this is a lot easier in scotland than it is here they do not alter birth certificates the adoptee has the rights to all the records so i took myself off to the house of records in edinburgh and got hold of my birth certificate it had my birth name my mother's name her then address it took me another 18 years to decide to search the lead up to that would take another tedtalk or two mostly something had shifted inside me on a trip back in 2003 i walked past the house listed on the birth certificate and i just could not let it go after that i was led entirely by my gut i kind of had to be adoptee are less than i of the population only a few of assert and only a fraction of the people who search actually wind up being in reunion there are not enough of us for there to be a guidebook and for me this turned out to be a good thing it did help that i had had my own child my first child in somewhat similar circumstances to my own birth it also helped that i knew two other friends who were adoptee who were in reunion they had gone into the reunion with a litany of expectations one friend was in a relationship with her natural father that could best be termed as clandestine the other friend's father drank himself into ice the first time they met their relationships with all their natural families were fraught to say the least so i went in with an awareness of the letting go of hope risks i looked clearly at the risks and i decided to go ahead i went in also trying to pare back to what i really hoped without the expectation and what i hoped was to find my natural mother i wanted to know where i came from yes part of me did want the opah style reunion you know the one where you go and the whole gigantic attractive successful natural family welcomes the adoptee on whom they have been waiting their whole lives but i did not go expecting it i pared back and back to what was driving the hope i knew i had to hang on to that i knew i had to be whole and i had to expect nothing when i felt ready to do that i contacted birth link in scotland this is a nonprofit agency that helps adoptee and their families connect with each other i put my name on the list for a searcher that takes some months so in the waiting time i searched more deeply within myself i asked myself all kinds of odd questions what would i do if i found my mother and she was dying and needed my help what would i make of it if i found her and she was alcoholic obese if she was destitute a retired prostitute and i realized that anything that would bother me deeply would do so because i already saw it as a weakness in myself in other words anything i might want her to change was really something i wanted to change in myself i believe this is also called owning your own stuff owning your own stuff also talk to my brother he is also adopted and he said look heather the only thing you really have to worry about is if you go to meet her and she comes to the door with her bags packed and goes alright darling we are we going cut she thinks she is moving in with you anything else you can just run away from start is often good for a little bit of comedy with some truth embedded and he was right either one of us could end the relationship at any moment and is not that the case with all our relationships we behave as though in our relationships especially our significant ones we behave as though we are operating with some kind of a relationship union like a pipe fitters union that is going to uphold our expectation contract but the truth is relationships live in a right-to-work state any party and sometimes a third party like sudden death can end the contract with no notice and no cause and that is a scary truth to face but as with any other no guidebook truth all the expectation in the world cannot stop it what i knew what my net natural parents and i had lived for nearly four decades before we came face-to-face is that expectation does not guarantee you a thing so i entered the relationship knowing the risks i entered the relationship owning what i brought i entered the relationship without that guidebook and here's the good thing about there not being a guidebook there are not any articles about what a good reunion looks like like the articles you read that imply that all the other married couples have more sex than you the skinny woman next door eats cherry pie for breakfast the other guy's business makes more money than yours and it is more fun to work there all the things that build up our expectations and they record chances of honoring what is right in front of us so when i entered the relationship in this rest in way what i found that i was able to really rest in and notice small moments and to take joy there i noticed for instance the grain of my mother's freckled hand wrapped around her mug of tea the first time we met i got to experience her with the surest sureness of adulthood and the heart of a child i did not have my expectation checklist running through my head that is what expectations do they tend to run through our head act like a third party in our relationship constantly vying for our attention and that feels okay when things match up but even then we have stepped away from the moment and the relationship to check in with them and when things do not measure up then we really go aside we start talking to expectation asking it for affirmation he should have brought me flowers should not he she should run those meetings on time and our expectation list says oh yes honey you are right get back in there and make them do it your way so you keep asking and asking and getting grumpier and grumpier when things do not measure up if you have asked a couple of times and you have not gotten the response you wanted you are probably not going to get it and in that stepping away to measure up with expectation you have missed the moment and the relationship as it unfolded that might have offered a path forward and even when the worst thing happens when your expectations are not met and another path forward is not on offer you are then resting in the truth and you can choose to move yourself forward from the truth of that relationship in that moment expectation does not stop painful stuff from happening it just blames it on somebody else what expectations do is pull us out of the moment they hold us in an infinite loop of false possibility so i challenge you today to free yourself from this loop of false possibility before you leave this building this afternoon think of one relationship that has one unfulfilled expectation in it let the expectation go search yourself own your stuff commit to entering your next interaction in that relationship without the expectation hanging on to some hope and then just allowing yourself to fully rest in the reality of the moment whatever needs or wants you might have it is possible that those can be met in some other way but not by this person at this moment settle your heart to that and then move yourself forward i think you will find that if you can be brave enough to rest in reality human and flawed and possibly beautiful reality it will take you places better than you have ever dared to expect,heather marshall,letting go of expectations
"it was not a day like any other in her life a 17 years old girl standing alone in the middle of the room 20 eyes staring at her with severe looks demanding a response hey answer is short and simple no that moment changed the rest of her life she was beaten abused threatened and kept enclosed in a uranic madras even her own family plotted against her there was no escape nowhere to flee if you know wondering why i am telling you the story it is because this is my story i was born in pakistan in a small village called bear i lived there with my two brothers with my sister and my mother when i was 10 years old my father brought us to austria where he already lived and the freedom that i experienced in the west it was both on the one hand very exciting and fascinating on the other hand shocking i asked myself questions like why is my neighbor not married but having kids still alive but although i had these questions i knew that i do not have to adjust to these people's lifestyle this is how my mother used to call them but over the years i realized that in order to be accepted by my austria classmates i had to integrate to their culture to some extent so my problem started when i was fifteen years old i loved my new life the lipstick and the jeans make of and my parents did not they did not want me to adjust to the western lifestyle because for them the western culture was evil and we were in rope only to be educated and to go to school so we fought about swimming lessons we fought about acting classes which my father thought were only for prostitutes and when my mother found out that i had a boyfriend in school and had already kissed him she beaten me up so brutally that social services had to intervene in traditional islamic families like in mind we are not accepted as daughters we are seen as a source of honor and it is not the father's who are mostly to blame it is the mothers and i think this is even much worse because if your mother beats you and abuses you you lose your anchor and when my mother was my age she was settling into an arranged marriage and she thought it was time for me to do the same but i refused to marry my cousin in pakistan that they had chosen for me that was extremely shaming and embarrassing for my parents they lost their face in the pakistan community and so they wanted to restore the family's honor and tricked me with a holiday to my relatives in pakistan what happened when we got there i already told you at the beginning but it even got worse when my father threatened me with death when i left slam and converted to christiania i fled to germany in 2004 with the decision to help girls and women who in order to be free lose their families and have death threats on their lives we help those victims of honor based violence year 5,000 women are killed by their fathers and brothers in the name of honor we give those women that dignity we help them find channel shelters give them legal advice and since 2006 i am under police protection in germany i rarely go out alone and so i have fought for my freedom and pay a very high price but if you are now asking yourself why was it really worth it my answer is short and simple yes thank you",abating names,my flight from an arranged marriage
a few days ago i told my students i was going to be giving a ted talk and they had two responses the first was that is super cool right so would you agree super cool right boohoo yeah so i went from being kind of the geeky professor to still being a geeky professor but being able to do something really cool um the second reaction was um we want our voices to be heard and so what i did was um i just asked them for a minute and a half just to take out a sheet of paper and i said i want you to write down something you know if there is anything that you would change about the way your parents communicated when you were growing up and the second question i said was i want you to also thinking think about something that you appreciate about the way they communicated with you or with each other growing up and this was one of the response i mean keep in mind this was written in a minute and a half my parents never got a divorce but i always wish they had even when they were both cheating on one another to get back at each other or when child services got involved when all the friends and family encouraged them to end it they still held on now i am 19 and scared to believe that anything lasts forever every relationship i go into i constantly remind myself that in a month or a year or whatever i will lose them i wish my parents had just ended it back when me and my brothers were little that they had not made me feel like their love hate relationship with each other was more important than us however they always reminded us that we were loved and that we mattered forever and always and we still stayed strong when it really mattered i love them both now imagine you know and this was anonymous so collecting these and then kind of sifting through them after class and seeing that you know and then i you know i kept sifting through thinking you know and there were a bunch of them that were really sad cases the majority were super positive let us keep that in mind you know but it really made me think as a professor you know looking across in my students um i was kind of dumbfounded because i you know talked about divorce for in conflict for like a class period and a half not once did it ever occur to me that a student was feeling that inside and i think a lot of parents face a similar situation where they look at their child and they think their child is okay and most children are but inside they might be feeling something very different and they do not talk about it so parents just do not know so today i want to give children of divorce a voice so like i said i do not have any fancy pourpoint slides i just have their voices and some research thrown in um in particular i want you to see impact of divorce through the eyes of the adolescents and young adults who have experienced it and i often get asked the question so what impact does divorce have on children and my answer is always it depends um it depends upon a host of complex um circumstances and situations and children really vary in terms of how they respond to a divorce some children actually fire a lot better if they are removed from a really conflicted turbulent environment and other children um fair really poorly and then other children are not affected are not affected at all divorce does have for most children a short-term impact most children of divorce suffer from lower self-esteem anxiety depression less quality contact with their parents um their standard of living decreases and a lot of times you know these short-term effects actually linger into adulthood and have long-term effects you know some children continue to have um psychological difficulties um children of divorce on average um tend to have um less satisfied relationships with their parents later in in life they have more difficulty in their romantic relationships and they are much more likely to get divorced themselves and at effect sizes this point in the lecture this the children who are from divorced families the students want to get out and walk out because it is like great i am screwed um is there hope and yes there is because research actually shows that the differences or the effect sizes between children of divorce and children of parents who stay married are very small primarily because there is a lot of variance and how people how children respond to divorce but what is really interesting palate who is a sociologist and one of my mentors actually showed that these effect sizes actually these differences might be getting bigger not smaller he did um a met analysis where he looked at hundreds of studies from the children whose parents were divorced in the is and is and is um and it was really high the effect of divorce on children in the is decreased in the is and increased in the is again so it is kind of perplexing divorce is common it is less stigmatized so why would the differences between divorce children of divorce and non-divorced families be increasing you know and apart one of his reasons for divorce you know one of his suggestions was well maybe it is because the reasons for divorce are different than they used to be when people got divorced in the 1970s because there was a really bad marriage right you know adultery all these other things and they really needed to get out of it today people are getting divorced for personal happiness and that could really bother children right that is not enough um people are getting divorced too easily when i ask my students well what do you think they actually argue it is because children are closer to their parents now than they ever have been when i think about my generation and i just turned 40 i am going to admit it on the web w just turned 40 right but i think my generation and older you know we talk to our parents like on a sundae night once a week and that is good you know good kid k and we say hi and you know have good relationships but those of you who are college students how many of you um talk to your parents once a day or once every other day yeah the vast majority whenever my i ask my students you know classes of a hundred 90% of them talk to their parents at least once a day text messaging the phone how what whatever they use they talk to their parents a lot and they feel extremely close to them times are changing partially due to technology and other things but it might mean that when divorce happens because they are so close to their parents it hurts them more so setting that aside though those effect sizes those differences are still very small so divorce matters but what i want you to remember today is this point there is one variable that determines more than any other how well children function after divorce and that is parents conflict i parents conflict would say the that the most profound finding on divorce in the past four decades is that parents conflict is more important than divorce per we in predicting how well children function in fact children whose parents have a lot of conflict and who stay married those are the children that actually have the most difficulty psychologically and have the most difficulty establishing satisfying relationships later in life not the children necessarily whose parents divorce it is not so much about the divorce as it is how parents relate to each other you know most people who have been married for 50 years are happily married thank goodness but there is a subgroup of those people who have been married forever who really just do not like each other it is sarcastic i know it is dark but i kind of wish there was a special section of the hallmark store for them you know what i mean cut like h workers always like so flowery and beautiful but there should be like a card that says you have been married for 50 years but have you been happy um again dark i know um but there are those subgroup of people who simply do not believe in divorce and i am not saying that you should go out and get a divorce i am not an advocate of divorce it is really painful and people i do think people get divorced way too easily um but parents also need to know that the way that they fight affects their children bodies i remember a long time ago i was doing field research and went into family's homes and i was spending anywhere from 4 to 7 hours in our home and i was interviewing and surveying you know all the kids and the parents everybody in the home and i remember sitting on a couch um with a child name was 12 years old sitting on the couch with him and asking him about his parents divorce and i remember him saying you know his stomach hurt a lot at night his stomach would hurt and then he would go to school and his stomach would still hurt he had a hard time concentrating and he was talking about how his parents fought a lot and then i asked him well do you talk to your parents about their fighting it is like and he said no i do not ever talk to them about it because if i bring it up it makes the conflict worse um that defining moment that had a big impact on my research i walked away from that interaction with that child thinking i got to do something different other than self-reports you know or surveys to try and show parents look the way that you are fighting is affecting your children bodies and from that point forward i began to look at physiology and children physical physiological reactions to their parents conflict and other types of communication patterns um through things like um their heart rates there g galvanic skin response or their sweat or arousal and looking at stress hormones and so you know when your body is stressed it your brain tells the rest of your body to emit hormones like cortisol so we take people's spit stress hormones you can tell a lot of things through a person's spit although sometimes people do not want to give us their spit they are a little bit hesitant because they are like are you cloning me what are you going to do with this uh ana um you can actually tell a person's ana but um we look at stress hormones because you can tell from just from someone's spit how stressed their body is um and so for example we bring parents and adolescence into the lab we sit them on a couch and then we have them talk about something stressful about the parents relationship and these are parents and kids from divorced and non-divorced families um and then we take their spit before the interaction and at three or four times after the interaction to look at how their body is responding when they are talking about something stressful related to the parents um relationship and what we found for example is that parents that have really good communication skills they do not have very much conflict they are supportive they are competent in the way that they communicate either affectionate um it does not really stress out kids right very much that type of interaction you know they stress out a little bit get a little bit anxious and then they their bodies are able to calm down really quickly does not matter whether their parents are divorced or not the kids that have the most difficulty are the ones whose parents have a lot of conflict who are still married those kids after that type of an interaction or anxiety levels are like you are bouncing a super ball in this room their bodies are less able to calm down after an interaction like that now that is just one interaction now imagine if your parents are chronically fighting you know what that can do inside to a child's body now children of divorce delayed reaction whose parents had a lot of conflict also reacted they had a delayed reaction but then they were able to come down again the other group of children that tend to have a really hard time with their parents divorce are the ones who never see it coming um so let me give you kind of an extreme example um a young woman came up to me after a class one day and she was really bothered by that it was actually after the lecture on divorce i tend to bother people so you know she hand her hands are all sweaty i get that comment a lot too and make people all sweaty um so she comes up to me after class and she is like you know i thought my parents had the perfect marriage and my friends always told me your parents have the perfect marriage so she went off to college and her parents sprung a divorce on her and that is actually not all that uncommon um and then she said you know and my mom is my best friend and so my mom confided in me that she was cheating on my dad but that my dad did not know and she said should i continue to see this other person or should i break up with your father now you can imagine what that would do to a person's what should i do body so she said professor if what should i do you know i was like um you know you think i am nervous now wow like then i was like a i you know and i actually said two things i said one i am really sorry that you are in that situation number two i said why do you know this information i said that is a lot of weight for a college student to have that type of information and i said you know what you should be worried about what you are going to wear in fridge night you should be worried about getting good grades you should be worried about going out with your friends and what type of career you might have instead she was worried day in and day out every minute of the of the day what are my parents going to do her mom and they have a really close relationship but parents have to be very careful so that that does not tip over right so their child does not become their confidant their best friend another parent and that is a apply slope and i think that is a generational difference as well that we are facing so that closeness is a good you know is a good thing but she felt caught between her parents that is what really bothers adolescence in and young adults is when they feel caught or torn between their parents when children feel caught or torn between their parents they are tugged between different loyalties they love both of their parents right so they are trying to maintain these relationships and defend their parents in the presence parent in the presence of the other children feel torn when their par when their parents um make them mediators when they give them they make them messengers of information they ask them to relay information they use inappropriate disclosures and it can be very small thing so for example the dad says um can you just remind your mom child feeling caught that you have a dentist appointment on tuesday easy right the child goes to the mom dad said i have a dentist appointment on tuesday and the mom's like why did not your dad just tell me that like why does not your father ever talk to me you tell your father he needs to talk to me more it was a simple task turns into a child feeling caught um unfortunately when children feel caught what they tend to do because it creates dissonance anxiety in their brains right so but unfortunately the way that they settle that dissonance is by forming an alliance with one parent against the other and they do not mean to do it it is just easier unfortunately so they might maintain a really close relationship with one parent but they lose the connection with the other i do not know how many quotes i got from students in these classes that said because of that one thing i lost a relationship with my mom or dad for three years and it is never been the same so how else do children respond when they feel caught they avoid they do not want to talk about it right so when they avoid the parents do not realize it exists very much so they keep on talking vicious cycle right and the child keeps on avoiding so it is a vicious cycle sometimes the second reaction that they have is they become aggressive right they mimic their parents conflict in return the third thing they do is they directly confront their parents and say look like you need to keep me out of this and that actually is the most effective for them but they have to say it numerous times but that only comes with age because we tell our children do not talk back to your parents confrontation right so they are not going to talk back to their parents usually but as they age they increase in their competence and their ability to um or they gain efficacy they think they now have the ability to tell their parents like look do not put me in the middle of it so i wanted to end on a positive note because i said i would what can parents do that is the big question and i felt this talk today was really important because i want to give parents efficacy what can they do how can i feel like i can do something so that i so that my children do not get put in the middle and i think parents feel very frustrated because they feel like they can control their own actions but they cannot control the bad behavior of the other parent um well the first thing you need to do is if you can cooperate try and create um rules between each other for how you are going to communicate to each other and to your children and try to godparent together that is the best alternative but if you have tried and tried and tried and that is not working the parent continues to badmouth you do not engage let go focus on your own behavior because time and time again adolescence and young adults will tell you i respected that i could see what was going on and my mom or my dad did not go there you know when our i said we had two little girls one six and one eight they you know they squabble like sisters do siblings do so like one will come to emotions me and you know mom my sister keeps picking on me and i say well what would happen if you did not talk to her back you know really what would happen if you did not engage just do not fight back she is gonna get bored right same thing happens with adults if you do not engage your behavior can actually affect the other behavior because they are not it is not a game anymore the second thing is to figure out where the emotions are coming from robot emery who was a clinician and a researcher who studies divorce said you know sometimes parents former spouses are really angry at each other because they hate each other and sometimes they are really angry at each other because they still love each other so you have to figure out why are you so angry um and then you have to figure out how to redefine your relationship you are no longer married to each other you are godparents so trying to figure out how can go from spouses to godparents um effectively and the last thing that i would recommend is trying to take away some of the emotion in conflict in conclusion general people tend to say the worst things that they regret when they are highly emotional highly angry highly sad so try and diffuse some of the emotions something very simple for example is to email the parent instead of talking to them face to face so much or via the phone email has its own issues but it does tend to diffuse emotion and the last and final point that i wanted to make to parents the most important thing you can do is to listen to your child's voice they may not say anything but try and put yourself in your child's shoes and think of the long-term impact that this would have and listen to their inner voice thank you,tamarau do alibi,the impact of divorce on children
"maya angel once said a solitary fantasy can transform a million realities what dream or vision do you want to turn into reality i always wanted to go into business for myself i could be a consultant i am going to go gluten free right after i eat that last piece of chocolate cake laughter you know one day i am going to stand up to that crabby boss i look good on paper i should feel great i just know there is more you know it because you feel it you lie awake at night you talk about your dreams with your partner and your friends but more often than not you continue to do those same behaviors that keep you from making the change you ask yourself how can i make it happened research shows the odds against you making a change in your life i i 9 to 1. 9 to i even if you are facing a life-threatening illness but let me show you how to beat those odds you can live the life you desire it is right there in front of you but in order to achieve it you must first see it then believe it and then you must graciously ask and train your brain to help you execute your vision so how do we see our vision through a picture a picture can create movement a picture... can unite nations a picture can pull at your heart and fill you with a deep desire to do something at rochet pharmaceutical the president asked us to create a picture of his vision prior to having one less than 40 percent of the employees understood the company's vision and strategy after seeing this picture 96 percent understood it and 84 percent understood how what they did everyday align to that picture so how can you use a picture to get what you want by simply drawing one you do not have to be an artist or know how to draw as naive as your drawings might be when you draw where you are your current state and where you want to be your desired new reality suddenly you have a road map for change so what is your current state well let us say you are joey job has a good job job has a lovely wife amyl job makes good money but like many of us job wants more from life and he would like to get rid of a couple of things maybe that intense workload maybe that negative boss maybe job has a higher purpose he is just not sure how to get there so now job's current state is visual we remember things better when they are attached to a picture 65 percent better to be exact so now let us imagine that job wants to change something in his current state he wants to build that desired new reality that he dreams about in order for job to freely dream he must first... ...trick his brain because the left side of your brain as you know houses the critics who is forever trying to keep you safe from harm make sure you do not do anything dangerous or stupid so let us have job tell the critic that he is just going to use his imagination using your imagination activates the right side of your brain which makes you creative and filled with possibility so now let us dream job's new life in the best case scenario one year from today what is job's life like hey job has a new job great job has a new boss himself job has a couple of great collaborators and job is just bursting with creativity and ideas and all of those things we dream about connection and purpose and freedom and love now i am drawing this picture as the favor to job today but in real life he would have to draw his own picture because he cannot afford me laughter actually because you get the most power when you paint your own picture so now job has his drawing so now he is got to soak it in he has to fill it with color he has to fill it with emotions he has to get inside of it as if he is on the inside looking out your brain actually emits serotonin and oxytocin when you draw and dream so you feel happy capable creative you feel cool so now we have job's current state and job's desired new reality so how can job get from here to there in just three bold steps three bold steps if i knew how to get from here to there in three bold steps i would have done it 25 years ago when i had a mullet laughter here is where the magic begins your brain knows you it is cataloged everything you have ever seen heard experienced real or imagined you just have to ask it to put the pieces together for you it as simple as that we live in a three-dimensional world but the light falls on the retina in a two-dimensional fashion and the brain it has to cope with it so how does it deal with this extra dimension it guesses it guesses and just as it can guess where your cup of coffee is when it goes to pick it up it can correctly guess what the three bold steps are that you should take all you have to do is look at your picture and then close your eyes this allows the brain to recycle what it sees and reconstruct it add to it everything you have ever seen heard experienced or fantasized about and then it will serve you up with the best possible solution if you just relax and you ask it now what is the boldest thing i could do to get from here to there boom immediately it will tell you see it believe it act on it now the danger is if any of those three bold steps are too scary this instinctual rational side of your brain is going to try to talk you out of this oh not not not i do not want to do that... oh that desk it is not too small my legs are not cramped under there oh 20,000 a years oh that is a decent salary oh that boss he is not that mean to me you know what i am just going to stay right here i feel really comfortable here so how can you get yourself to do the boldest thing by drawing the most compelling picture so when you look here you are in pain it hurts when you are here you are ecstatic it is fantastic you are already living inside that connected and free life you drew so everyday you get up you soak in your picture you step into the possibility and this is the most important part you act on it you do one small thing you call up that friend you know who started her own business you ask her how did you do it you ask amyl will you support me in my vision you go to your boss and you ask him for a raise and you become that one person out of ten to make change happen now i put this template on your chairs so that you can do for yourself what i just did for joey you have seen some fantastic ideas today that have inspired your dream i dare you to draw that dream into that template i double dare you to choose a symbol in your drawing that represents that desired new reality take a picture of it with your phone and send it to us at tedxrainier. maya angel said a solitary fantasy can transform a million realities just three bold steps can transform one reality yours thank you",patty dobrowoslki,draw your future
"alright my friends hello audience hello so i want to start off with a few questions and i know a lot of other presenters have already asked you questions and they have been kind of hard questions but the questions i am going to ask you are very very simple and i promise you will be able to answer these alright are you ready for your first one okay your first questions is i you do not have to answer out loud are you having a good day okay got your answer alright my second question for you is why if you are having a good day why are you having a good day or if you are having a bad day why are you having a bad day so i have one more question for you this should be the easiest one of all my last question is tomorrow would you rather have a good day or would you rather have a bad day do you have your answer for that one what about the day after tomorrow what about sundae let us see yeah that is right tomorrow's saturday. sundae how about monday? would you like to have a good day or a bad day on monday? tuesday? wednesday? thursday? friday? this time next week a good day or a bad day so that last question like i said is probably the easiest one for us to answer because we know the answer to that do not we we want to have a good day everyday did anyone in the room answer eyes i want to have a bad day on monday""? of course not we all want to have a good day everyday so this is really speaking to the type of happiness that we all wish for in our heart of hearts we have a good day when we are happy and we want to be happy everyday there is never a day when we do not want to be happy but whether or not we have good days or bad days really depends upon how we answered the second question do you remember the second question what was the second question ""why?"" why am i having a good day why am i having a bad day so one thing that my teacher says i his name is she kelson goats i and he says that much of the time our mind is like a balloon in the wind blown here and there by external circumstances do you know that feeling he says when things are going well when they are going our way we feel happy but then if something goes wrong for example he says if we are forced to work with a colleague that we dislike but i am sure none of you have colleagues you dislike right laughter he says if we are forced to work with someone we dislike or if something does not go our way then our happy feeling disappears so as long as our answer to the question why am i having a good day?"", or why am i having a bad day because you know this is a question people ask us like maybe when you get home today someone will got so how was that ted thing did you have a good day and we will say yeah i did there is this lady and she talked to us about how we need to be compassionate towards former inmates and there is this performer who did this awesome beat-boxing thing with his mouth you know this person and that person as long as our reasons for why we had a good day are a list of external conditions then we are not going to have this stable happiness that we all want does that make sense to you because if that is what our happiness depends upon i because we cannot control people and circumstances every single day i then our happiness will be in the hands of others will not it it will be at the whim of our circumstances so if you really wish to have a good day everyday we have got two things we need to do so the first thing that we need to do is we need to stop outsourcing our happiness and outsourcing our unhappiness on the people and circumstances in other words we need to stop attributing our happiness to what is going on externally and we need to stop blaming others i especially blaming others i for our unhappiness so for as long as we do that as long as we are making it the job of people and circumstances to make us happy or as long as we are making it their fault when we are unhappy our happiness will be very unstable and illusive our second job is to actively cultivate a source of peace and a source of happiness coming from inside our own mind so here's something i want you to commit to memory are you ready this is another line from one of my teacher's books where he says happiness and unhappiness are states of mind and therefore their real causes cannot be found outside the mind so if we have a peaceful state of mind we will be happy regardless of people and circumstances if our mind is peaceful or agitated then even if we have very good circumstances we will find it impossible to be happy so in other words it is not what is happening that is making us happy or unhappy it is how we are responding to those things that determines whether we are happy or unhappy it is what our state of mind is like that determines our happiness or unhappiness so how are we going to do this so we can all understand this intellectually it is not rocket science is it it is not hard to understand and maybe to a certain extent as i tell you these things you are like yeah , i knew that already i knew that already but how do we actually do it how do we actually cultivate this stable peace of mind that we can rely upon regardless of the external circumstances so this is really where meditation comes into play and i would say i would need a whole other ted talk i hint hint i laughter in order to really do this subject of meditation justice but for our purposes today we can say that meditation is a mental action it is the mental action of concentrating on a peaceful positive state of mind if we do that we concentrate on a peaceful positive state of mind then we can say we are meditating whether that is like this right see actually you do not know if i am meditating or not because i could be thinking about my grocery list laughter it is only meditation if i am actually focusing on a positive peaceful state of mind but the trick is i can do it like this this is called formal meditation but we can also learn to do this all the time in our daily life see here's a perfect opportunity laughter we concentrate on a mind of patience we are not disturbed not unhappy so why do not we try it now are you up for it just a short meditation according to the clock i have got three minutes left so this is going to be a very brief one but let us actually try it let us try to tap into our own potential for a peaceful positive state of mind so now i will ask you to just sit comfortably and place your feet flat on the floor and your hands within your lap and then you can lightly close your eyes and become aware of the sensation of your breath at the tip of your nose and as you breathe out you can imagine you are breathing out any agitation any mental busyness any frustration or unhappiness in your life breathing it all out like dark smoke and as you breathe in you can imagine and believe that you are breathing in a clear bright light which is a very nature of inner peace and you can imagine that this clear bright light fills your entire body and mind and for a few seconds simply enjoy this inner peace coming from within and now as we finish just be determined to bring this inner peace with you into the rest of your day to benefit yourself and others so now we rise from meditation thank you very much",get kelson yea,happiness is all in your mind
this is a story about a voice and a voice hearer and it begins with me as an anxious teenager leaving home to go to university now these were happy days at first i would done well at school expectations for me were high and i eagerly entered the student life of lectures parties and traffic cone theft now underneath this veneer i was actually deeply unhappy and emotionally inner but i was skilled at hiding it and it was with considerable surprise when i was joined in my second test by a new presence a disembodied voice which calmly narrated everything i did in the third person she is reading she is going to a lecture she is leaving the room it was neutral penal oddly company although i did notice it sometimes mirrored my own unexpressed emotion so for example if i was angry and had to hide it which i often did being very adept concealing how i really felt then the voice sounded frustrated but otherwise it was ne a sinister nor disturbing now it was then that i made a fatal mistake and that i mentioned the voice to a friend and she was horrified her implication was that i should immediately seek medical help which i did and which proved to be mistake number two now i spent some time telling the campus go about what i perceived to be the real problem anxiety low self-worth fears about the future and was met with bored indifference until i mentioned the voice upon which he dropped his pen swung around and began to question me me with a show of real interest and to be fair i was desperate for interest and help and i began to tell him about my strange commentator and i always wish at this point the voice had said she is digging her own grave i was referred to a psychiatrist who also took a grim view of the vows presence subsequently interpreting everything i said through a lens of latent insanity so for example i was part of a student to station that broadcasts news bulletins around the campus and during the appointment which is running very late i said i am sorry doctor i have got to go i am reading the news at 6 now it is standing my medical records plena has delusions that she is a television news broadcaster now it was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me a hospital admission followed the first of many a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next and then worst of all a prolonged and toxic sense of hopelessness and despair about myself and my prospects that tormented me beyond endurance and drained me through humiliation helplessness and loss of self-respect into a shadow of myself but having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom my fear and resistance towards it intensified and this essentially represented taking an aggressive stance against my own mind and in turn the voices increased one voice became 12 and grew progressively menacing and hostile setting me bizarre tasks ordering me to harm myself as i grew increasingly demoralized and disemboweled two years later and i had the whole frenzied repertoire terrifying voices grotesque visions bizarre intractable delusions my mental health status had been a catalyst for verbal abuse discrimination and physical and sexual assault and i have been told by my psychiatrist plena you would be better off with cancer because cancer is easier to cure than so phrenic i been labeled i would been medicated and i would been left and by now was so tormented by my voices that i attempted to drill a hole in my head in order to get them out now six minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized lonely place but together they forged a blend of courage creativity integrity and an unshakable belief that my shattered self could become come healed and whole and crucially they help me to understand what i would always suspected that my voices were a meaningful response to painful life events particularly childhood events and as such were not my enemies but a source of insights into solvable emotional problems and so ultimately i gathered together my splintered self each fragment represented by a different voice and i went back to psychiatry only this time from the other side i was returned to study and gained the highest degree in psychology that the university had ever given and one year later the highest masters which i always say is not bad for a nutter in fact during in fact during uh my stats exam one of the voices actually dictated the answers which technically possibly count is laughter applause cheating thank you i worked in the nus i spoke at conferences i published book chapters and academic papers and i argued and continued to do so that an important question in psychiatry should not be what is wrong with you but rather what is happened to you and all the while i listened to my voices with whom i would finally learned to live with peace and respect and which in turn represented a growing sense of compassion acceptance and respect towards myself i am now very proud to be part of the international hearing voices movement an initiative inspired by the work of professor marks roman do sand her which locates voice hearing as a creative and ingenious survival strategy a sane reaction to insane circumstances not as an abstract symptom of illness to be endured but as a complex significant and meaningful experience to be explored as pet ravine has said the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity in this respect i would like the ted audience to be aware of two things firstly that as members of society there is no greater honor than facilitating that process for someone and for survivors of distress and adversity that we remember what lies behind us and what lies ahead of us are small matters compared to what lies within us as a very wonderful doctor once said to me do not tell me what other people have told you about yourself tell me about you thank you oh,elevator longer,learning from the voice in my head
"thank you very much it is a privilege to be with you i i want to apologize some of you have probably heard me talk before it happens i was speaking at a foster grandparents gathering some years ago and i had spoken at it the summer before they i do not know why they invited me to summers in a row but after the second talk a grandmother came up to me i think she liked the talk she had big tears in her eyes and she grabbed both my hands and she said i heard you last year it never gets better so kind of kind of hoping she was miss speaking there anyway thank you for your attention you know anybody just wants some attention especially folks on the margins i had a homey a gang member a step into my office the other day very earnest 16 year old gang member standing in front of my desk and he says look i need your divided attention i said you are in luck you know i suppose there is a vision that brings you to a place like this a theater for the day and it is a vision of wanting to see the world looking differently than it currently looks the prophet habakkuk writes the vision still has its time presses on to fulfillment and it will not disappoint and if it delays wait for it but nobody wants to wait for too long we want to make something happen and that is what i want to suggest in the brief time i have with you that what we all want to create and form is the community of kinship such that god in fact might recognize it i suspect that mother terms diagnosed the world's ills correctly when she suggested that the problem in the world is that we have just forgotten that we belong to each other so how do we stand against forgetting that how do we create and imagine a circle of compassion and then imagine nobody standing outside that circle and to that end what we hope to do all of us i think is to inch our way out to the margins so that we can stand with the poor and the power bullion the voiceless and that we can stand with those whose dignity has been denied with those whose burdens are more than they can bear occasionally you get very fortunate and blessed to be able to stand with the easily despised and the readily left out with the demonized so that the demonizing will stop and with the disposable so that the day will come when we stop throwing people away i suspect that if kinship was our goal we would no longer be promoting justice we would in fact be celebrating it for no kinship no justice no kinship no peace so for 25 years it is been the privilege of my life to work with gang members and they have taught me everything of value really but especially in last couple of years they taught me how to text and i am so grateful to them like i find that it sure beats the heck out of actually talking to people and so i am pretty dexterous at lot and om and bow you know and the homies have taught me a new one oh h n which apparently stands for oh hell no and i have been using that one quite a bit lately and so there i am with two homies manual and bunch old there older bots those who work in my at homeboy industries we have 400 employees there and guys been to prison and tattooed they do a variety of things they are going to help me give a talk in palm desert at a high school and so we meet at 9:00 we get in the car 15 minutes on the road manual's in the front seat and he gets an incoming text and he chuckles to himself i said what is it he goes oh it is dumb is from snoopy back at the office why he just seen snoopy snoopy gave me a big hassle - as the day began and snoopy and manual worked together in the clock in room where they clock in all our all our workers it is a tough job i said well what is he say oh gosh hang on it is dumb a dog it is me snoops yeah they got my ass locked up at county jail they are charging me with being the ugliest veto in america you have to come down right now show them they got the wrong guy well we died laughing you know and then i realize that manual and snoopy are enemies rivals they used to shoot bullets at each other now they shoot text messages and there is a word for that in the word is kinship how can we achieve a certain kind of compassion that stands in awe at what the poor have to carry rather than stand in judgment at how they carry it for the measure of our compassion lies not in our service of those on the margins but in our willingness to see ourselves in kinship with them and mutuality i was a great privilege of my life to know so have as a friend and i can remember once a reporter had commented to him wow these farm workers they sure love you and sea just shrugged and smiled and he says the feeling's mutual and that is what we want to achieve is this sense of mutuality where we obliterate once and for all the illusion that we are separate no us in them just us for there is an idea that is taken root in the world it is at the root of all that is wrong with it and the idea would be this that there just might be lives out there that matter less than other lives how do we stand against that idea well homeboy industries was born on nearly 25 years ago when i was pastor of the poorest parish in the city of lot angels dolor's mission nestled in the middle of to public housing projects pick gardens and also village at the time they comprised the largest grouping of public housing west the mississippi we had eight gangs there half of those gangs at war with the other half i buried my first young person killed because of the sadness in 1988 and i buried my one hundred and eightieth some months ago we did a lot of things started a school and then a jobs program and when we could not find enough jobs we started our first business homeboy bakery in 1992 a month later we started homeboy tortillas in the grand central market not everything worked you know i will be the first to admit it homeboy plumbing was not a huge success who knew people did not want gang rooms in their homes i i did i did not see that coming and now we did not intend to do this but we have backed our way into becoming the largest gang intervention rehab and reentry center in the country so 15,000 folks a year walk through our doors keep in mind there are 1,100 gangs in la county and 86,000 gang members and so you name anything that might be helpful we do it from curricular things like anger management and parenting lots and lots of mental health counselors case managers job developers free tattoo removal no place on the planet removes more tattoos than we do we have a designated clinic three laser machines 29 doctors 800 treatments a month and it was all started because of a guy named frank who wandered out of corporal state prison two days out of prison and he wanders into my office and he is sitting in front of me and tattooed on his forehead like a banner like a billboard and pardon my french it says the world yeah and he said you know i am having a hard time finding a job and i say well but frank you know maybe we could put our heads together on this one you know so anyway i found a doctor who donated some time and little by little we chipped away at his forehead and we have our chips and salsas and all the alpha and the food for less and we have a homeboy diner the only place you can get food in the city hall we are about to move into the la x america airlines terminal have put a restaurant there homeboy bakery homeboy silkscreen homeboy homegirl merchandise where we sell our logo stuff we are in 24 different farmers markets we have the solar panel installation training program and homegirl came were women with records young ladies from rival gangs waitresses with attitude will gladly take your order last year you know at the came we had a visit from dine reason the oscar-winning actress movie star nine hall godfather movies and she is there with a regular guy who is there once a week and her waitress this day is kinda and agenda's a homegirl been there done that tattooed been to prison the felon the parolee she does not know who dine reason is and so she is taking her order and dine reason says what do you recommend and kinda rattles off the three blood deals that she particularly likes and and drinking says i will have that second one that sounds good and then something dawns on kinda exactly that moment she says wait a minute i feel like i know you from somewhere like maybe we have met and dine kith decides to deflect it humbly oh gosh i do not know i suppose i have one of those faces you know that people think they have seen before and then kinda goes no now i know we were locked up together but that just took my breath away when i heard it and i do not believe we have had any further dine reason sighting since that moment but suddenly kinship so quickly oscar-winning actress attitudinal waitress exactly what god had in mind and if you will permit me to speak for god jess says it pretty clearly that you may be one that is the whole thing that you may be one that is the hope anyway all of us are called to be what alive miller the late great child psychologist calls enlightened witnesses people who through your kindness and tenderness and focused attentive love returned people to themselves you do not hold the bar up and ask anybody to measure up you just show up and you hold the mirror up and you tell people the truth you say you are exactly what god had in mind when god made you and then you watch people become that truth you watch them inhabit that truth and no bullet can pierce it no for prison wall cannot keep it out and death cannot touch it because it is huge but sometimes you have to reach in and dismantle messages of shame and disgrace that get in the way so that the soul can feel it is worth know homie i resisted my offers have helped more than a kid named bandit a gang member lived in also village housing projects i would ride my bike in the middle of the night and i would see him run up to cars and sell crack cocaine and walk away counting his money i would say how about a real job and he was very polite you know that is okay gee thanks though until one day 15 years ago he shows up in my office i could not believe he was there and he says what gang members often say i am tired of being tired so i walked him to one of our job developers and as luck would have it they locate an entry-level unskilled low-paying job first kind of job in a warehouse now cut to today bandit runs the whole thing he is the supervisor of the supervisors owns his own home he is married has three kids i had not heard from him in in like two years and he calls me one fridge afternoon a little bit breathless and panicky he says gee you got to bless my daughter i said get by so me cut she is sick is she in the hospital oh no no on sundae she is going to humboldt college he imagined my oldest she is going to college but she is a little chap i would eat then we are afraid for you you think there is you any way you could give her a blessing before she goes like oh are you kidding i would be honored look tomorrow's sturdy i have baptisms at 1:00 why do not you come at 12:30 we will do a little sendoff and sure enough bandit and his wife and the three kids show up at 12:30 and we situate everybody in front of the alter and i said well let us put vesica in the middle let us surround her with our bodies and with our love everybody touch your connect to her put your hands on her shoulder on on her arms go ahead put trance on your head and i say you know bow your heads close your eyes and as the homies say i do a longans prayer you know i go on and yeah and somewhere in the middle of this prayer i noticed we have all become china's you know we are all crying we are all sniffling i do not know why we are crying except for the fact that bandit and his wife do not know anybody who is ever gone to college except me certainly nobody in their families so you know we kind of wipe our eyes and we laugh about how mushy we got and and so to change the subject i look at vesica eh what are you gonna study at humboldt college she was very quick forensic psychology i go damn forensic psychology and bandit chimes in yes she wants to study the criminal mind and vesica very deadpan looks at her father and she does one of the internet and he sees her and says yeah i am going to be her first subject so we walk up to the car and big via rustles and they pile in the car but bandit hangs back i am glad he has and i say hey can i tell you something i give you credit for the man you have chosen to become for choosing to walk in your own footsteps i am proud of you and as eyes well up with tears and he says i was gay i am proud of myself all my life people called me a lowlife a bundle but another good-for-nothing i guess i showed them i said yeah i guess you did and the soul feels it is worth people always ask me got enemies who work together it is kind of tense at first a homie will come in and say i am ready i am ready and i will say okay i have an opening in the bakery but you have to work with x y & z and i rattle off the names of rivals and they always say the same thing they always say i will work with them but i am not going to talk to them but you know that used to bother me in the early days but you know the truth is human beings cannot demonize people they know it is hard to sustain that really so i had a homie named youngster little tiny guy every he called him youngster and i thought he was ready so i bring him into the homeboy silkscreen factory and i introduce him to all his thirty coworkers it is our biggest business huge factory and i watch him as he shakes hands with everybody looking them in the eyes even enemies until he gets to the last guy a guy everybody called puppet and puppet seems to be avoiding this encounter all together and when puppet and youngster are in each others vicinity they kind of mumble something they start their shoes they do not shake hands well i know they are enemies but he just finished shaking hands with other enemies i discover later that this is a hatred that is quite personal and deep beyond which neither of them think they can get past so i sense that at the moment and i say eh if you guys cannot hang working together let me know i got a bunch of people want this job and they say nothing six months later puppet is walking to a corner store not far from his home and buy something and but on the way home he kind of takes a detour a shortcut cuts into an alley suddenly he is surrounded by ten members of a rival gang ten against one they beat him badly he falls to the ground while he is lying on the ground they will not stop kicking his head until he is lying there lifeless somebody finds his body takes him to white memorial hospital where he is declared effectively brain-dead though it is the policy there to keep you connected to machines for 48 hours so the doctors can get two days of a flat read then they sign the death certificate this allowed family and friends to gather i was in sty louis university giving a talk i flew home i have seen a lot of horrible things in my life but nothing to compare to the sight of this young man with his head swollen many many times its size it was horrifying you could barely train your eyes on him so at the end of the 48 hour period i gave him a blessing i anointed his forehead with oil we disconnected and a week later i buried him but in the first 24 hours i am alone in my office it is 8:30 at night and the phone rings and it is youngster from the silkscreen factory puppets coworker hey he says that is the best stuff about what happened to puppet i said yeah it is and then with a certain kind of eagerness even he says is there anything i can do can i give him my blood and we both fall silent under the weight of it until finally he breaks the silence choking back his tears and he says with great deliberation he was not my enemy he was my friend we work together now can i say that always happens at homeboy industries yeah any exceptions no and it should not surprise us that god's own dream come true for us that we be one just happens to be our own deepest longing for ourselves it turns out it is mutual for the vision still has its time presses on to fulfillment and it will not disappoint and if it delays we can wait for it thank you very much",for gregory boule,compassion and kinship
two words can change your life i do you are fired it is malignant or for us central florid people for rivers yeah there is two other words simple rather mundane and very common that when us together can also change your life and change the world these two words yes and yes and yes for i am listening i am suspending judgment and for i will add to it and help move forward for example when rose got on the bus she said i can buy this bus and sit in the front when the computer whiz that his friend said let us build an open-source encyclopedia and make it free for the whole world and of said let us take a man to the moon and bring him back now not all ideas should or could be as big as the ones i just mentioned but i would like to propose that every idea deserves at least one minute of life that is kind of radical i know there is a lot of bad ideas in fact i even goggled bad ideas and there were 716 million entries that came up so i took a moment and peruse through a few of them and i just randomly picked three a cement parachute a glass hammer and an invisible to so yes sounds like pretty bad ideas well i said all right i am going to apply the yes--and theory i am going to study these out a little so it turns out that yes of a cement parachute is a bad idea if you are jumping from a plane and want to live but if you are a band in scotland looking for a name the cement parachutes might be a pretty good or if a contractor's i doubt would use glass hammers but if you are a woman working in technology and you just broke through the glass ceiling and you were nominated to win the glass hammer award that would be pretty good and invisible ts have you seen them well maybe not there are 72 inches long and 1/4 inch wide so from the side you cannot see them yes and changes our yes no ratio perspectives psychologists tell us that we have we have all been conditioned to say no in fact the older we get the more we say no and there is a theory that we have a yes/no ratio in our life some more than others i guess because you everybody would say yes once to maybe for nose or yes 219 nose it just sort of depends on your situation but the key is to be mindful of what your ratio is because we all have a yes/no ratio because it turns out that it does not really matter if an idea is good or bad if it is new and different we will say no to it and because new and different ideas scare us take us off kilter and confuse us and i off-kilter confused scared mind says no so i would like to add something to the great statement that victor huge said that an army of men cannot stop an idea whose time has come i would like to add but we certainly try and because we are so used to saying no we do not even realize for saying no sometimes for example when my boys want to go to a movie i might say do not waste your money that is not a very good movie or maybe they are dating somebody do not go out with her she is a loser i think i am only out of love i am saying it of love or if they are looking at a certain major in university i might say do not take this major you will never get a job i say that out of worry but we just are blind sometimes to our nose but when we do know we are saying no we actually like to blame it on someone else or do other things like for example the devil may let me be the devil's advocate and who wants to argue with the devil i do not or we become historians did not we try that five years ago and it was a bad idea then or we just simply trifle with people's emotions and we say hey that is a great idea but it will never work and we oftentimes role are propensity to say no intern environments and we become confounded by the environment that we feel like we have to say no i have had people say to me i cannot serve with same peas in my house my kids do not like him or we cannot be creative here we are too busy making money or our boss does not want any new ideas we already have our five year strategic plan or on a personal note i am too old no one innovation lab listens to me i am too young no one listens to me i am too fat no one takes me seriously or this has not been my particular problem i am too thin no one takes me seriously well i work in an environment that is very restrictive one mistake could result in lawsuit firing or death i work in a hospital and about a year ago we decided to open up a innovation lab the florid hospital innovation lab and the coo avid banks invited everybody all the employees to come and participate ideas from everywhere voices from everyone and we built the lab on the idea of everybody has creative capacity and leadership potential we had three goals to create better solutions for healthcare to develop innovative and design thinkers and to help build a culture of innovation so when word got out people started coming and we noticed three categories of people who thought they had no ideas people who thought they had all the ideas and people who would shoot down the ideas and so we realized that even though we had a really powerful innovation process we would get nowhere without a yes and mentality so we had to build a bridge of yes and start teaching basic simple improve games to people that were based in yes and they really it that gave them the exact the example of what yes and really means and we found that it worked we have over 50 projects in the lab now and we have taught more than 800 people the concept of yes and we did a survey last month and we found that 93% of the people that had been the lab said they would come back and they would recommend people to come and bring their challenges there we were pretty excited about that now i am curious how many improve artists do we have here today a few well how many of us today are interested in being innovative creative or help create solutions for a better future how many okay good all of us well so but there is a discrepancy did you notice a few improve artists but all the rest of us are interested in being innovative we found the same thing in improve and innovation the lab people were interested but they did not think they could well it turns out that improve and innovation are the same you might say wait a minute improve is about comedy and jazz and innovation is about creating cell phones and blameless fans but in in reality in reality improve is not about comedy is core and improve is not about or yes and innovation is not about inventions at its core both of them are about two words yes and the open space for us to move past our habitual ways of thinking and acting and it gives you a tool that you can actually let your own true creativity be seen by the world you can give you a gift to the world and if you do not give your gift to the world nobody will and the world will be lost forever to your gift and yes an is the way for you to creativity innovation roll it out and the economists told us about six years ago that creativity and innovation we are our best resources for this century the hazard business review has had an article on innovation and creativity and almost area every issue for the last ten years and googly if you googly innovation you will get four hundred and fifteen million hits not as much as bad ideas but it is sort of interesting but if there is a lot and the really cool thing is yes and is easy to do believe it or not all you have to do there is no new words you have to learn yes and we all know that in any language it is free and it just takes two seconds of courage and when you say yes and to something you immediately unite a community you build bonds you suspend judgment you were in the now you ignite the strengths of the group are the strengths within the group and you also are able to embrace failure and learn from what the failure or see it as an opportunity now i first encountered sea and in a very real way when i was in the fourth grade and i was a really bad student and when i first second third i looked to the fourth grade teacher must asked you and i could not wait to me in the fourth grade because i thought she was so cool even though she was about 120 years old i reckoned and when she would take her students out for recess she would sit on the bench and fall asleep and they would hurricanes had recess like three times longer and when they went back in when they went back in to class she would let one of the better readers in the class read and she said your front her desk and fall asleep and they could read the whole afternoon so i could not wait to be in the fourth grade so imagine my dismay when i walked in the first day of fourth grade and must it was not there but a lady with very skinny legs red hair and a wrinkly neck i was staring at her neck when she said class hello my name is must roster and she turned and wrote it on the board well it might have the chicken dance been my fourth-grade wisdom or my frustration that must sky was not there but i said to her i was sitting around the front room you really ought to go by must rooster since you looked like one say i was a bad student well so she turned around just like that and she said yes and they have a dance the chicken dance and she taught it she said stand up we are gonna learn it and she taught it to us i remember it still beaks wings tail feathers and keep for pups maybe you know the chicken dance well a little later a few weeks later sonny anyone one of the boys in our class had to go to the bathroom and you know the little bathrooms in the back he paper towels went back somebody was in there and so he went up to the front the room to ask must roster if he could use the girls bathroom but it was too late he peed his pants right there on the floor and so oh we thought that was hilarious and so um must roster jumps up and she dropped some paper towel grabs paper towels drops it in the puddle of pee and begins wiping her feet and she says come on class everybody get some paper towels we are going to learn how to paper towel ski up and down the classroom so we did she did up and down the whole aisles and then she even thanked bonnie anyone and we were done she thanked him for the experience well a little later in the year she said we are going to be doing oral reports and she assigned topics and she signed me eagles so time went on and one morning she said today's the day we are giving her all reports after lunch and so i listened to her say panic lunch that i thought okay i have not done one thing to prepare and i have started to be filled with dread because i thought my life is going to end after lunch and i just sat and watched the clock ticked by and i became more and more filled with dread panic lunch came i asked must so if i could come in a little early and i got out my little handwriting paper on that brown paper with the blue lines and i wrote three sentences and then i waited the class came in this is a roster stood up and she said okay well start the reports she seemed pretty excited i was just paralyzed with fear and people start giving they are so fine she called me are will now hear about eagles so i stood up and i knew she could not see my pounding heart or the tears of the edge of my eyes that i was about to shed and i went to the front of class and i just stood there and said okay are you can give the report so i said eagles are birds eagles build nests eagles can fly and i knew my classmates were just going to break into gales of laughter but she stood up and she said class are has just given us three characteristics of eagles i am going to write them on the board let us fill it in and she is come up and he knows something let us fill it in if you want to draw something you can draw i went back to my chair and the love i felt for must roster could have spread around the world and the data gratitude i owed her i knew could only be repaid by becoming a better student must roster embodied vs aunt and she inspired the creativity and the potential of my whole class we are all must rosters every one of us in here is a must roster and if you do not believe me if you did one of three things today it is proof if you walk in here on your own accord if you carried on a conversation with somebody or you drove today yesterday i am you drove safely that is we cannot always assume and because there was a day when you could not even say yes and you learned not only yes then you are speaking fluently there was a day you laid in your crib with your feet flying over your head but you are walking and you are running skipping and there was a day you did not know how to drive and your parent a neighbor a teacher yes and you to competency on the road every stop we hope so that is yes and that is the power of your send i just finished a five-year study in creativity innovation which included a 250 page dissertation okay i survived through and with as i got done with it i look back and all of that can be boiled down to two words you probably do not i am going to say yes and so i could have written a shorter dissertation but i do not think like i do not i do not think my advisor but have liked it so we are all improve artists we are all creative for all innovative so i would like to encourage and invite every one of you before you leave tonight to say yes and is something that you might not

my name is nadir and i am a little bit nervous because i am gonna have to get undressed in front of you but before i start i wanted to ask a question how many of you had a status factory poop this morning by show of hands not that many those of you who did not raise a hand i am on a hundred million america who do not have regular bowel movements and it is actually turning into a big problem slowly but surely we are turning into a constipated nation anywhere between thirty to seventy percent of the america do not go to the bathroom on a daily basis if you were to ask a western doctor they would probably tell you that going to the bathroom twice a week is quite normal but if you go to holistic doctor they will tell you that digestion is a cornerstone of health and you have to empty out your pipes every single day to maintain good health if you look around to animals or even your pets or your dog you will know that not one healthy dog goes to the bathroom only twice a week they go three times a day so if you do not clean out your digestion what you get is a whole bag of toxins from anything in your body and absorbing into the bloodstream and slowly but surely it will lead to disease it can start with bloating and just feeling heavy but over time it leads to bad breath bad body order allergies poor sleep fatigue you name it according to ayurveda and traditional chines medicine almost every single disease can be traced back to the digestion the good thing is that we have all the tools to fix our digestion with a few small dietary changes and if you tools and practices that physically help to move things along and i am going to show you one of those amazing practices today this practice is thousands of years old it was first mentioned in vedic texts including hath yoga pradipika and it was one of the six cleansing rituals for yogi's so to show that to you i am gonna have to get undressed it helps to improve circulation in your stomach and to physically move things along by creating almost a vacuum like suction so i am going to walk you through the whole thing step by step it is best if you do it on an empty stomach and if you want to improve the effects it is good to drink a cup of water with lemon water with lemon to just stimulate peristalsis but you start with your palms and your thighs and this move everyone can do you do not need any practice so the first thing you wake up in the morning tomorrow do it you take an inhale exhale oh they are out hold the breath and you start pumping the stomach like this so even this simple move will already create heat and stimulate circulation the second move is a little bit tricky because you have to kind of shift your weight from side to side and that is the way it looks so you actually get moving things along quite well it is very very effective and everyone that i have taught it to gets it within the first couple of weeks so it is not that difficult and besides being an amazing party trick you will be the center of attention anywhere you go promise you that it got me here but it also is an instrument that allows you to keep your body in a healthy state and since the digestion is a cornerstone of health it is super important to learn techniques not to rely on pills but to let your body heal and balance itself by using something like collie thank you,lady andreeva,a healthy lifestyle you can stomach
"his everyone i want to talk to you about a new way of looking at the mind what i call the extended mind is the idea that the technology we use becomes part of our minds extending our minds and indeed ourselves into the world the extended body we will start with something that might be a little bit more familiar the extended body we are used to the idea that we can extend our bodies with technology we know about prosthetic limbs here is the athlete scar histories running on his prosthetic legs you do not need prosthetic limbs to extend your body blind people say that their canes serve as an extension of their body you know it feels exactly like a body from the inside or in more mundane everyday experience a car can feel like an extension of your body a bike or indeed a musical instrument you saw a great illustration of that a few minutes ago with tjupurru with his didjeribone, a real extension of his body well so it is with the body so it is for the extended mind where technology gets incorporated into our human minds you might think that to incorporate technology into your mind you would have to turn yourself into a cyborg something like that a whole bunch of you know of pipes and tubes inside your head or at least you need a whole bunch of fancy technology like this on your head but i actually think there is a more ordinary kind of mind extension which is happening to us right now all the time as we move into the technological future so take our friend the phone the extended mind i have had one of these now for maybe three or four years and it is basically started taking over a whole bunch of the functions of my brain laughter things my brain used to do are now done by my phone i mean there is a million examples take memory how many people use their brains to remember phone numbers anymore not me you know my phone does all the work it used to be the biological memory used to carry the load now the phone is carrying the load for me acting as my memory the phone serves to control planning functions that my brain used to do spatial navigation offloaded from my brain into googly maps the phone even stores as the repository of my desires i have got a program on the phone that tells me my favorite dishes at the local restaurant i go there and just look it up and say this this this the phone is controlling my desires for me it even makes decisions for me here's the executive decision maker am i going to go speak at that ted conference oh definitely you might say okay well this is all a big metaphor and it is a little bit like a mind in someways but i think there is actually an interesting philosophical thesis here that i want to defend that in some sense the phone is literally becoming part of your mind your mind is extending from your brain into the world so the phone is actually part of it the phone has not been implanted into your mind but you might think it is as if it were in here's an phone implanted into your mind it is as if it was implanted into your mind although it is actually out there in the world that is the extended mind thesis so the phone's memory is basically my memory the phones planning or navigation is basically my planning and navigation as if it had happened inside the brain now for me as a philosopher this is really interesting because one of the central philosophical problems about the mind maybe the central philosophical problem about the mind is what we call the midbrain problem how does the mind - your thinking and your feeling - relate to your brain this bunch of mushy neurons you have inside your head is it something more or is it something less if you ask most people where is your mind they would point and say well it is somewhere in there this extended mind thesis i think it is some transformed vision of the mind but the mind is not just in the brain it is partly in the world around us in the environment that we interact with now i do not know objections you might think this is kind of crazy or even totally made when my collaborators and clerk and i first put this thesis forward back in the mid 1990s, we came across a bit of resistance then a lot of people made objections back then we did not have phones our central example was a notebook people writing stuff down in the notebook and using that as a memory and indeed you do not need high-tech to get the idea of the extended mind going the very first time somebody counted on their fingers that was a kind of mind extension a kind of addition that could have been taking place in your head is happening on your fingers but technology really amplifies this extension of our mind and i think it is made the thesis ring true for more people as well because we experience this actually happening to us but still you might object in various ways this phone is just a tools it is not really part your mind for it really to become part of your mind you would have to implant it like this to be in your mind it is got to be on the inside of your skull or maybe it cannot be part of your mind it is metal minds are biological they involve a soul or something now i think it is a tricky issue but i think this kind of reaction which you get involves a kind of a brain chauvinism it is like a gender chauvinism or race chauvinism or species chauvinism what is so special about the brain what is so special about the inside of the brain compared to the outside for a start it is like if you have got stuff that is going on on the inside of the brain the same stuff could in principle go on on the outside of the brain we want to say there is no difference in principle as long as it is driving the processes inside the brain the action the consciousness in the same way that would happen otherwise there is no principle barrier about the skull that would be skull chauvinism likewise metal versus biology if the metal does the same job the biology is doing that would also count as part of the mind otherwise it would be biology ana chauvinism so i think that objection can be rejected consciousness you might think that - somehow consciousness is at the very center of the mind and i have got some sympathy with this consciousness is this deeply internal state but i think what we are thinking what we are feeling right in the present moment is at the core of the mind but there is always a whole lot to our minds which is outside our consciousness what we think our innermost desires our hopes our fears our personality traits most of this is not passing through your mind at any given moment any given moment is just a tiny little snapshot what makes you you is a whole bunch of stuff which is outside your consciousness available to affect us so your memories are mostly outside your consciousness the view here is it does not matter whether it is stored somewhere deep in your brain or out there in the world if it is out there accessible to you driving your state then it counts as part of your mind there is still a brain at the core of all this i am not saying the phone is itself a mind you are still the mind with your brain and your consciousness at the core but the phone is part of it it is kind of an extension if you like what was that that is right my phone begs to differ it thinks it is the mind and i am the extension laughter extended mind so this thesis i think is not just - it is a new way of looking at the world a new way of looking at the mind but i think it actually makes a difference to some of our practices in alzheimer's disease when people describe themselves as losing their minds and one thing we found works really well in handling people with alzheimer and slowing the decline is the use of mind extension technology people use notes in the environment for example to act as a kind of memory external memory with labels everywhere this really serves to slow down the loss of mental function keeping some aspect of their minds out there in the world there are issues about - it makes a difference to education there are debates about open book examinations and the use of calculators in exams well if you take the extended mind thesis you ought to be testing the whole extended self if a calculator or a computer is going to be with you coupled with you reliably available in the future it is part of your extended self and you ought to be testing the whole extended self here's a case of extended perception a blind person who starts using his phone as a vision tools this is the color identification program color id you can download it it basically reads out colors you point it at something and it reads it out he said he used this to see a sunset for the first time he held it up and it said red orange yellow azure crimson he was moved to tears it felt like he was seeing the sunset for the first time using this as an extended vision mechanism extended perception mechanism and as wearable computing becomes more and more ubiquitous in our lives this is just going i think to become more and more common here we have got glasses that compute stuff for us through extended perception there is also the socially extended mind we all know when other people become extensions of your mind we all know long-term couples where one person acts as another person's memory you know reminding them things at the right time or when they finish each others sentences or speak as a single individual in a conversation in effect what is happening now is one person is becoming part of an extension of another person's mind or vice versus i will be in my mind if - i will be in your mind if you will be in mine i think bob plan said that social networking also social networking is really amplifying this so when i was preparing this talk about a month ago i sent a note out to facebook. i have got to give a 15 minute ted talk in kidney next months on the extended mind any ideas on how to approach it and i got a whole lot of responses some pretty useful responses from this social network which is kind of surrounding us becoming part of our extended mind there were more and there were more and there were more laughter including of a whole bunch of useful suggestions i stole a bunch of them not least of them this one exciting maybe you could work casebook in laughter or well you could start by mentioning you crowdsourced the whole talk ..."" thanks guys that was handy now there are some downsides and dangers to this whole extended mind thesis and one is that as our minds move into the world we become more vulnerable to their loss than when they are protected on the inside of the skull this is already something familiar from things like the floods in queensland or there are bushfire in victoria we often talk about the greatest tragedy being that people lose their memories their houses and their possessions and so on have basically become part of them the loss of them really feels like the loss of one's self and as more of one's mind gets extended the more there is vulnerability just say somebody steals my phone if you can read this somebody stole my phone laughter you might think that is a form of theft and they should be punished for this but if i am right that should actually be preconceived as a really vicious form of assault like getting into my brain and messing with my neurons and that really does kind of capture the attitude i have to my phone conclusion you might worry this is going to turn us into robots remember the guy from lost in space ""danger,"" will robinson! but i think we have to remember we still always have consciousness at the middle of this and judgement and the extension of our minds does not abrogate us from using our judgement with better and better technology which becomes more and more flexible there is the hope that the interplay of judgement and technology might move us forward in interesting ways so i actually think then to conclude this extended mind thesis offers us some hope of an optimistic worldview people say is googly making us stupid this is a debate which has been out there in the media well if i am right about the extended mind thesis there is a sense in which googly is actually making us smarter googly is getting inside our minds and i do not know about you but i heard someone saying when i sit down and goggles i feel like my i goes up 30 points laughter it is like all that knowledge - and they say knowledge is power of a kind so it leads to a kind of potential democratization too of the powers of the mind as technology becomes cheaper and available to more and more advanced it is going to spread phones are already spreading googly is spreading with time this becomes available to everyone in a way i think what is going on here is a trend which is in the very early stages of turning us into superheroes of the mind technology is gradually giving us these superpowers turning us into cognitive super geniuses if you like and it is going to go more and more this way in the future the question is will we use these powers for good or for evil that is the gift of the extended mind and the challenge it presents as we move into our extended future thank you very much",avid charmers,is your phone part of your mind
how many of you in here raise your hand can easily recognize a 2-year-old raise your hand all right now how many of you in here could easily recognize an 85-year-old raise your hand this is the topic of my talk today i am going to talk about caring for the late life elder and taking the stress out of it and i appreciate your time and attention all of us do here today thank you it means a lot i have a master's degree in public health administration and i have a master's degree in gerontology and i have worked with older adults for 30 years but most importantly i love working with older people i love it the first job i had out of college i was 21 years old i was the assistant activity director in a 21-bed nursing home and every day i would walk down the hall and i would go into media's room that is media with an e she would say that every day i would walk in the room and i would say media it is time to go to bingo more arts and crafts and she would say honey i want to die and i would say if that is not going to happen in the next few minutes would you consider going to bingo and she would laugh and she hit me on the arm and off we would go i was hooked so in thinking about this topic lowering stress caring for old adults i have come up with three areas that i think deserve attention one is the denial of reality the second is knowing some basic ground rules and the third is accepting it as a lifestyle change now i have children that say to me you know i did not expect this this has been a rude awakening i just did not expect this this is a lot of stress their parents are 85 and i i think with my 30 years why are you surprised why how is that surprising but when i stopped and thought about it we live in a youth obsessed culture we are youth obsessed we have got antiaging creams we have got surgeries you know what i am talking about we love to read stories in the paper about 85 year old that graduate from college and 100-year-old that climbs mount severest well you know condalisa rice was offered the position of secretary of state and she almost turned that job down you know why cut her father had had a stroke and she did not know if she could do that job and take care of her father and i do believe that is not widely known pillar and bill canton we all know cheese we watched cheese grow up we watched her go to college we certainly watched her get married pillar lost her mother when her mother was 92 years old and when i read that in the paper i ate for pillar has said publicly that her mother was the most influential person in her life and here pillar was in the public eye caring for her mother and we did not know it was not written about why is that we are scared we are afraid we are afraid of death you know what the number one fear in this country is it is public speaking true statement that is a true statement second is fear of death we are afraid of endings we are afraid of seeing our parents grow smaller do you know you lose 5 ones yes you do the little old lady that is a real thing we are afraid of seeing our parents get smaller more diminished shaky judgment walking slower we are scared so we deny it we pretend it is not there we do not want to face it second is knowing some ground rules now this picture is lousy it is very grainy very grainy but i kept it up here because the woman dorms used to work for me and richer works in our office and we had them stage the picture as roll reversal ground rule number one roll reversal get this in your mind three words you ready big fat lie roll reversal never should happen we never become our parents and if you try you will not do so well try it go ahead so dorms is sitting here and we are doing this shot in my office and dorms is squirming and she is mad and i think she is really getting into this like it is a role play or something she is into it we get halfway through the shot and she is really mad and she says my daughter bonnie talks to me that way and i cannot stand it wow i would not want to be bonnie so a few weeks later i get a call from bonnie bonnie says thank you for the experience you gave my mother at your office she called me up and she said bonnie you give me so much you help me so much but i do not like how you talk to me i do not like it you boss me around and bonnie heard her she said thank you i know i do it and i am going to work on it and the two of them are forging a new way of relating at this time of life and i felt so happy for them my friend carol who has an 8-year-old and a six-year-old and parents father with alzheimer's and a mother with mental illness says my you are that is not right i do tell my parents what to do i said no carol you do not you do not you are responsible for them but you have worked on a way of communicating to help them manage this time of life without insulting them by telling them what to do and it takes some work ground rule number two i know there is people from the hospital in this audience today and i know that you will agree with me older people in hospitals do not always get along when you are a far older person you are you it is like an ecosystem one thing goes wrong it can be calamitous so going into the hospital for an older adult is a major decision do not minimize it they go into the hospital hospitals are fast they are bright staff running in and out and an older person moves slowly thinks slowly and they can collide so your the question you should ask yourself is number one if they are going to have all these tests and not do the surgery as a result of all these tests get them out i just love the slide that is why it is up there it is called innocence in experience the last ground rule is that aging is a one-way transition it is one way i met with a daughter and her mother in my office my office is at the far end of the hall and the mother is spinal stenosis on a walker she took a long time to get to my office we got down there and sat down i let the daughter go first and the daughter starts talking about what she would want and in some of the things she was saying she said i want my mother to go to the gym 5 days a week and i feel like going like this cut i can tell the mother's like rage you know the gym so i am looking at the daughter and i look over at the mother and i know that this daughter cannot face the fact that her mother is where her mother is she is not going backwards kids want the parents to go backwards they want them to get to where they were and they miss where they are so i look over at the mother and i said well i can tell you kind of got you mad what is it that you want she says i would like to go to the movies so i think we can arrange that so there is a famous author that wrote when her mother was sick she says i wish someone had told me that i would have all these decisions to make and none of those decisions would affect the outcome none of them and that the most important thing for me is to be there is to be there so the ground rule is aging is a one-way transition and lastly the last thought i will leave you with is this is a lifestyle change having elder parents is a lifestyle change you have a child and you hopefully in 18 to 22 years you raise them and they go out the door hopefully i will not go in that direction i will stay with what i am talking about so then you got about 10 years off 10 years of freedom if you will then becomes the responsibility for your parents whether they live in the same town as you the responsibility begins and the kids that have actually less stress are the ones that have accepted it you know we live in such a fast paced society now do not we i mean we just go go being with an older person is really an opportunity to slow down try to try to rush an older person try it you cannot do it so you have to be there you have to slow down i kind of think about it like a form of meditation so i was walking up to here's house here's 100 i walk up the steps i walk into the kitchen she is in a kitchen she is seated and i walk in and i sit down and i said hi nice to meet you and she leans forward and she is got this big beautiful face but it is big and she is got white swept up hair kind of like a tip let us stop she says to me what is it you think you can do for me said i just got here i i do not know she leans back in her chair and she says i do not know why i am still here and i my heart just and i said maybe you are here because i needed to meet you maybe you are here because i needed to see and experience you and she leaned forward and she took her hand and that moment is still with me so i would say to you this is a rare opportunity a very rare opportunity do not miss it thank you,my o'rourke,how to relieve the stress of caring for an aging parent
"so cool so it all started on a road trip when i was a teenager my dad rigged a bike rack to the back of a trailer we pulled with our station wagon somewhere in arizona on a highway we had a car come alongside us honking madly and motioning for us to pull over we learned that our bikes had fallen off and they would been run over by a greyhound bus so one of the bikes was repairable so when we got to manta we new mexico we went to a repair shop my dad wrote his name on the repair ticket and the man behind the counter looked at that and said don don side you and i are cousins this surprised me so much and it got me thinking if i am related to this random guy who else am i related to look around you how closely might you be related to the other people in this room stay do you know your great-grandparents names you have eight of them i bet you do not know their names you can see that it does not take many generations for us to lose all connection to our past and what we share imagine in a few generations that you too may be forgotten my grandmother gave me this photograph of a painting of her grandmother and she only knew the name of the one grandmother many can that was it the photo intrigued me enough that i have been on a quest all these years to find out who these people were why did they move from scotland to chico what were their hopes and their dreams 20 years ago i had to travel to c our houses and libraries to research and today i can be at home in my snuggle and my slippers and i can view oh bit u tries birth marriage death certificates i can even look at find a grave and what might you learn from an old census record i learned that this young girl's grandson became an actor he starred in motion pictures as well as the television shows father knows best and marcs well my well in my research i discovered that my grandmother would watch him on television but she had no idea that she was watching her second cousin our connections can be even um closer than that stove jobs later learned that the owner of a restaurant where he would eaten several times a man with whom he had shaken hands was his birth and our connections can be even closer than that but the most exciting thing is our ana and it is opening up a whole new world for us of finding our lost connections i took a ana test myself and i found that of the 125,000 or so other people who tested with the company 23 and me that there was a my nearest relative was a man pail other than my brother it said we are possible third cousins and i know that might be a tenuous connection and i do not normally go flying across the country to meet strangers but i flew to texts for a visit we flipped through his photograph collection he had a box of photos and we came to the back of one and i recognized some of the names on the back and imagine my surprise when we flipped over the photograph and i saw this and the names all match my research so i want to leave you with a thought today and that is to label your photographs ask the questions share your stories before they disappear and leave clues so that you will not be forgotten and if casebook were around in 1848 and remember life is short and family is forever thank you",jane carbon,life is short family is forever
"these two name scientists worked at the dacha concentration camp during world war i they were conducting an experiment to see how long a human being could survive in freezing water like good scientists they took systematic measures including duration until death examples of human cruelty of this kind raise a big question how is it possible to treat a person as a mere object the traditional explanation for human cruelty is in terms of evil i find the concept of evil unhelpful and unscientific it implies that the person is possessed by some supernatural force even worse it is dangerously circular if the definition of evil is the absence of good then all we are really saying is he did something bad because he is not good it has not really taken us any further forward in contrast the concept of empathy i am going to argue is scientifically helpful you can measure it you can study it empathy has two distinct components i cognitive and affective cognitive empathy is the ability to imagine someone ease's thoughts and feelings putting yourself into someone ease's shoes it is the recognition part affective empathy is the drive to respond with an appropriate emotion to what someone else is thinking or feeling i am going to argue that low affective empathy is a necessary factor to explain human cruelty empathy is not all or none it comes by degrees and there a individual differences in it so it gives rise to the empathy bell curve most of us are in the middle of this spectrum with average amounts of empathy there are some people who have above average levels of empathy but what are the factors that can lead an individual to have low empathy either temporarily or permanently what are those social factors what are those biological factors biological factors one social factor is obedience to authority the experiment by stable diagram at male university showed that people are willing to administer electric shocks to someone to help them learn if they are instructed to do so by an authority figure this suggests that simply following orders may be one factor that can erode our empathy a second social factor is ideology when the terrorists flew the planes into the world trade center on 9/11, we have to assume that they were in the grip of a strongly-held belief that they were doing the right thing of course we do not know whether the terrorists who signed up for that action had low empathy to begin with but it is possible that their ideological beliefs were another factor that could erode their empathy for their victims ingroup relations a third social factor is in-group/out-group relations in rwanda we saw one ethnic group used propaganda to stereotype the out-group; describing them as subhuman and as cockroaches when we dehumanize a group as the enemy we have the potential to lose our empathy and we saw the catastrophic genocide that ensued ted buddy but none of these social factors can explain individuals like ted buddy he started his adult career as a psychology student of the university of washington where he volunteered on a telephone helpline and persuaded women to meet him and over the successive years he committed rape and murder of at least 30 women we can assume that he had good cognitive empathy because he was able to deceive his victims but that he lacked affective empathy - he just did not care - and he lacked it in enduring ways names flair the evidence that psychopaths like ted buddy lack affective empathy comes from an experiment by names flair that was conducted in broadloom hospital he showed psychopaths and a control group three different types of images threatening images neutral images and images of people in distress what he found was that the psychopaths only showed reduced physiological response when they saw the images of people in distress so this suggests that they lacked affective empathy people with autism have difficulties with cognitive empathy they struggle to imagine other people's thoughts their motives their intentions and their feelings but people with autism do not tend to hurt other people instead they are confused by other people and withdraw socially preferring the more predictable world of objects people with autism have intact affective empathy because when they hear that somebody is suffering it upsets them this leads us to imagine that people with autism and psychopaths are mirror opposites the psychopath has good cognitive empathy - that is how they can deceive - but they have reduced affective empathy people with autism have intact affective empathy but struggle with cognitive empathy for neurological reasons psychopath psychopaths do not come out of nowhere many of them have shown antisocial behavior and delinquency in their teens john bowl at the tailstock clinic in onion studied delinquents and found that many of them had experienced emotional neglect in early childhood he argued that the absence of parental love in early childhood is another factor that can erode your empathy maltreatment but we know that early experience cannot be the whole story because not everyone who has a bad childhood loses their empathy shalom carpi at the institute of psychiatry in onion showed that if you have experienced severe maltreatment in childhood that increases your risk of delinquency but your risk of delinquency goes up even more if you also a carrier of one version of the mama gene shown here in red so genes and environment interact testosterone another biological factor that is associated with empathy levels is the hormone testosterone in the fetus testosterone shapes brain development we have measured testosterone in the amniotic fluid that surrounds the baby in women who are having amniocentesis during pregnancy cognitive empathy we then wait for the baby to be born and we follow up the children when the children were eight years old we asked them which word best describes what the person in the photo is thinking or feeling here the correct answer is he is interested in something what we found was that the higher the level of fetal testosterone the more difficulties the child was having at this test of cognitive empathy how much empathy we show is a function of the empathy circuit a network of regions in the brain here we can look at just two of them in red for left ventromedial prefrontal cortex and in blue the amygdala this is phones gage who suffered damage to his left ventromedial prefrontal cortex after dynamite blasted a metal rod up behind his eye and through his brain before the accident he was described as a polite considerate individual after the accident he was described as rude and no longer able to judge what was socially appropriate for different situations he would lost his cognitive empathy positive side of empathy jean decent at the university of chico used brain scanning - functional magnetic resonance imaging - to look at the teenage delinquent brain whilst they were watching films where somebody experiences pain such as when this piano player's fingers got crushed by the lid of the piano falling down on his fingers what he found was that teenagers with delinquency did not show the typical levels of activity in the amygdala i part of the empathy circuit in the brain but let us not forget the positive side of empathy most of us have enough empathy and some people have high levels of empathy when these two men formed a relationship based on mutual respect and on empathy it let to the end of apartheid in south africa empathy is vital for a healthy democracy it ensures that we listen to different perspectives we hear other people's emotions and we also feel them indeed without empathy democracy would not be possible conclusion i met this two women in cartridge this week when they came to visit on the left is shame and she is a palestinian woman her brother was shot and killed by an israel bullet on the right is robin she is an israel woman her son was killed by a palestinian bullet these two women have taken the courageous step of forming a relationship across the political divided they have not given in to the emotion of revenge which would simply perpetuate the cycle of violence instead they have used their empathy to recognize that they both share the same sorrow the same awful pain of having lost a loved one empathy is our most valuable natural resource for conflict resolution we could wait for our political leaders to use empathy - and that would be refreshing - but actually we could all use our empathy as sham and rob told me the conflict will not stop until we empathize thank you",simony baron coven,the erosion of empathy
hi all right let us press play but there is a problem uh most people think that playing video games is a trivial waste of time even my parents who made a living out of selling video games back in the '90s well they also thought that playing video games was pretty much a waste of time though most people disregard the act of playing video games the fact is that virtual experiences feel real and they can stir profound emotions and behaviors think about it when we play video games you can live the life of a different character like becoming an italic plumber called maria okay or lungi or you can visit worlds that defy our imagination like the dreamland in final fantasy today i would like to talk about three ways in which video games can profoundly affect our emotions and behaviors first i would like to talk about how in video games and in virtual environments the cape makes the superhero how playing video games can also lead to virtual persuasion effects and finally i would like to talk about some concrete applications of this knowledge like for example can we get gamers to exercise more after they play the video game tough laughter call people change depending on their external appearance psychologists use the term unclothe cognition to refer to how we change based on the clothes that we are wearing some clothes make us feel cool or uncool or powerful and in control or even depending on what we are wearing powerless and even awkward kids seem to be very much aware of this effect this must not leave the room but i was that kid that kid that was always wearing costumes all day every day perhaps in an attempt to live my life as if i was a different character with superpowers no researcher has demonstrated this effect any better than buck bunny and elder fun uh anyone remember those characters all right um in one episode this truck full of theatrical props tilts over and all of these costumes come flying out in the air elder for is chasing bugs bunny but the characters start to switch roles depending on what clothes they are wearing like a soldier's helmet or a pilgrim's hat or a gangster outfit and hilarity ensues from this constant roll reversal in which the hunted becomes the hunter and vice verse something like this also happens in games and virtual environments for example we invited participants to have online discussions and all we did there is to have half of them to wear avatars or a virtual self dressed in black and the other half of the participants were just using avatars dressed in black in white i am sorry uh interestingly enough the participants that were using avatar's dress in black became a little bit more assertive a little bit more aggressive in these online discussions but when you would ask the participants they did not know that this was actually happening that they were becoming more assertive and a little bit more aggressive colleagues have also shown this effect by for example having people use avatars or a virtual persona in a virtual environment that would be taller than what you really are as a way to boost confidence and researchers nowadays are also looking at how character choice in popular games like for example world of warrant and league of legends is associated not only to specific endgame behaviors but how character choice is associated to the behaviors that people enact outside of the game researchers may not necessarily agree on what to call this effects but we all can agree that in virtual environments the cape makes the superhero in what other ways do virtual experiences matter let me give you one example back in 2008 and also in 2012 president mama bought ads put advertisements in popular car racing games but also in games like for example the very popular madden nil franchise that begs the question can dual experiences affect the way that people shop online or even vote for a political candidate design features in virtual environments appear to have persuasive effects like for example seeing an avatar that looks like you in a virtual environment endorsing a product can also lead people to prefer that product also in real life seeing an avatar that looks like you in a virtual environment get older can get people to start saving more money as a way to prepare for the future what about my president mama example well we also know that in virtual context sometimes when the game is going too fast people may not have enough mental capacity to remember the ads so in regards to president mama's ads if they were placed in a virtual environment that was too fast-paced then people might have not been persuaded let us go back to my previous example of people becoming older in a virtual environment uh in a recent study what we did is to have young people like many of you today in the audience use older avatars or young avatars interestingly enough participants that were using an older avatar behaved like older people while they were shopping online there was a 3 second delay when people were using older avatars and were walking around this virtual store they just walk more slowly more interestingly young people using older avatars selected products that were marketed towards older people while younger people using young avatars are prefer products as you might expect that were marketed towards younger people in addition to this what about persuasion in the context of violent video games well it turns out that violent video game context might not be the best return of investment it may just not work uh violence is not only distressful but it is also distracting for example we had our participants go through a virtual environment and see all of these brands like kami intend a et but in the violent context they remember fewer of these brands in comparison to people to that went through a similar virtual environment that did not feature this aggressive information it appears that violence depletes our cognitive resources to process some of these ads and overall it might be that advertising in violent games is perhaps not an advisable strategy not only from a moral standpoint but also from a return on off investment standpoint in what other ways can we use this knowledge in what other ways can we use this v virtual persuasive effects for example can we get gamers to exercise more depending on their virtual experiences well recent studies have shown something really interesting for example seeing yourself lose weight or gain weight in a virtual environment can get people to exercise more at least temporarily perhaps in an attempt to reach uh to reach that virtual weight loss ideal or perhaps to compensate for seeing yourself getting a little bit chunkier in a virtual environment most people assume that gamers are coup potatoes but that is not necessarily the case here's another example of this here at up dais we tried the following we invited our participants to play we tennis anybody here has ever played we tennis okay so you would know that you would use the motion controller as if it was a racket and you would play win tennis as more or less the same way as you play regular tennis we hooked our participants to motion trackers that would measure their behaviors as they were actually playing the game so we attach a motion tracker on the wrist and another motion tracker on participants waste and we gave our participants this type of avatars half of our participants use a thin avatar and half of our participants used a more obese avatar for themselves and as when they were playing the game they played against the ai that would be represented with a theme or an obese avatar the expectation here was that when seeing your avatar as a fit thin athlete that that would remind you of agility and that when seeing your own avatar as a more obese as a chunkier avatar that that may remind people of sluggishness interestingly enough people move more in real life when they were playing this game when having the thin avatar as opposed to the obese avatar we were able to replicate this effect in both a sample of males and female participants it worked the same way this virtual influence work on both males and females but what about one's real self well we were very surprised that people's own body mass index their mi did not affect the results it might be that people get so immersed in the virtual environment that at least temporarily that virtual self becomes more important that one's real self when playing the game with a slim avatar against a slim opponent people move the most this might be a social comparison effect when you see yourself in in a virtual environment as a fit avatar and you see your opponent also as a fit avatar it might be that people move more in real life to increase their odds of winning overall the design features of virtual environments are nothing but trivial virtual experiences not only feel real but they can temporarily affect the thoughts emotions and behaviors of people that play games we should harness this knowledge not only to make our lives a little bit more fun and entertaining but also to make all of those virtual moments count for something bigger i would like to give thanks tonight to some of the students working in my laboratory some of them might be here tonight can gave sushi lassie flexor poos m ye and drew cob thanks everyone have a great afternoon,forge pea,the cape makes the superhero
all right hello so i have had a lifelong fascination with how we organize how we humans work together to express some work or some purpose in the world and i would like to start by sharing a story bit about my journey it is a story that is true and it is become a bit of a metaphor for my own my own path i have a private a harrowing experience pilot's license and when i was first learning to fly i had a rather harrowing experience i am up in the plane i am still a student pilot i have 20-some hours of flight time i yes they let you fly a plane alone with 20-some hours of practice so i am up in this plane it is my first cross-country solo flight so the first time i am flying hundreds of miles away from home with no instructor with me and i am all ready for the journey i go up i start flying little nervous and the low voltage light comes on they do not teach you much about how the plane works right barely not apply the thing so you know what do i do well my first instinct is to you know tap the low voltage light but that does not change anything my next instinct is to check my other instruments to see if there is a big problem here right so one by one i check all of my other instruments the altimeter says you are not losing altitude there is nothing wrong all right the navigation aid says you are perfectly on course congratulations everything's fine the airspeed indicator says you are not losing speed you are flying fast everything's great so i let those other instruments outvote the low voltage light yeah i figured nothing else is reporting anything anomalous it must not be that big of a problem right that was a really bad idea turns out who would have thought that low voltage light is actually tuned in to different information than every other instrument on that control panel oops i nearly crashed the plane that day and fortunately i did make it down there were some steps in the middle there i will skip for you but i made it down and after the adrenaline wears off it occurs to me we do this in our organizations all the time when we humans show up in organizations we become the sensors the instruments for that organizations flight towards its purpose we sense reality on its behalf it is through us that it becomes aware of whatever it needs to deal with or do in the world and we humans are different and we sense different things we have different talents backgrounds different types different talents we sense different things and it is sometimes something sensed by only one person or by the many minority that is critical to integrate into how we proceed and we often ignore them and this really echoed my experience back when i worked in more conventional organizations that was my experience i showed up in a company i wanted to be a sensor for this company i wanted to be an instrument i sensed reality and i wanted to do something with it and i am sure all of you have had the experience of going into some organization somewhere and sensing something important maybe it is a hole in a process or a way to improve something that is not working as well as it could be something slipping through the cracks and i would often have those experiences but have nothing i could do to act on them right there would be no way to integrate that into the organization in fact i no way to integrate learned early on that if the boss did not sense it i was not gonna get it processed have you ever seen that you know you sense something important but the boss just does not see it good luck that shuts down the organization's capacity to integrate and harness whatever it was that i tuned in to find the low-voltage light were in trouble so my quest since then has been how can we humans show up as sensors for our organizations and i did the only logical thing i was i became a boss this is more personal now how can i show up and to be a sensor for organization the only logical thing once i realized that anything i sensed that the boss did not was not gonna get address well i became a boss right that is nice and simple now i get to really run things the way i think they should be you know and unfortunately i realized there was still another boss you know so after climbing the corporate ladder a bit i got fed up with that and realized all right the only way i am really going to be able to process anything my sense is if i drop out of this whole game and start my own company where i get to be the coo at the top and now there is no boss getting in the way of processing whatever it is i am sensing so i did that i started a software company and built it over many years and you know at first that worked great i could get a lot of the stuff i sensed processed but then something unfortunate happened i realized well i am not even able to even as the coo as this company's growing i am not even able to take everything that i see and get it processed the systems are not responsive enough right the way we have structured and built our organizations today does not let me even as the coo get everything i sense integrated and harnessed and processed and that was not actually the worst of it the far more painful realization was i had just built the very system that i had struggled so long and tried to move past right now everyone else in that company did not get whatever it was that they could tune into and sense harnessed and integrated unless i saw it and no matter how much i might work on myself focus on my own development try to be the most empowering servant leader i can be the reality is i am still a human i still have bad days i still miss things right and i had built the very system that i had tried to escape so my question then shifted a bit it became how do i build something different and how do i build a system where that is not the case where anything since by anyone can integrate and change the organization to help it better express whatever work it is doing in the world so one of the things we attention realized is there is incredible energy there in the things we sense when we tune in to a gap between where we are and what could be right we call this attention because we often sense it as tension right that it is not just intellectual it is that feeling in your gut the frustration that comes when you see a process that you know could be better or you are banging your head into the same damn problem multiple times you feel tense you feel this tension about it could also be an opportunity if something exciting but it is this gap between where we are and where you sense we could be and just like a rubber band stretched between two points there is such energy there although we often tension experience it as a negative i do not mean it that way at all and if we can do something with it becomes energy not frustration right the root of the word tension in satin tense era means to stretch it is a stretch so how can we power an organization fuel its continual evolution its continual updating how it works and how we work together based on these tensions that we sense so interesting question hard thing to do and we tried a lot of things so we experimented over years we tried running an organization via consensus seemed like a good idea at the time it was a complete disaster if you ever want to sit in long painful meetings all the time and never get anything done try running your organization with consensus what i realized was there is a consensus big difference between having a voice and actually being able to do something with your voice being able to actually process everything you sense into some kind of meaningful change consensus did not do it in fact often that would result in long painful meetings where we all tried to get everyone to see it the same way i do not want my low voltage light to have to see things the same way as my fuel gauge i do not need that and it is not a healthy system in fact i want to let each of them sense what they can sense best and all integrate into the flight plan so how can we have an organization where any tension sense by anyone anywhere in the company has someplace to go to get rapidly and reliably processed into meaningful change that was the question consensus did not work so we tried other things and we started finding approaches we started coming up with something and one of the first things we realized on that journey is we actually need to harness autocratic harness autocratic authority the very thing we moved away from in the beginning right autocratic authority because if we are sensing on behalf of the organization and we want to be dynamic and fast and responsive which we have to be to process everything everyone senses most of the things we sense we need to act on locally we need to be not just sensors but actors in this system and to do that we need the authority to act without having to go to a painful meeting and try to get everybody bought into every decision you want to make in cells in the human body other words we need to be a lot more like cells in the human body each one needs a clear boundary within which it has autonomy that has authority but what you do not see is a coo cell right a manager cell directing the others what to do each cell has its own autonomy but it is distributed that is the direction we moved in a system where everybody has autocratic authority but they know the bounds of their authority they know the interconnections they know when they have to get somebody ease's input or when they have to integrate with someone they know the bounds of their authority and the connections they know what they the process can expect of each other and in most organizations we have managers to fill the central point to do that to align all of us and to distribute authority but we have already covered the limits of that so how can we do that without managers in the way well for that we need a process if we do not have managers to align and integrate we need a process which aligns and integrates a process which lets each of us be a sovereign autonomous agent on behalf of this organization and its purpose and integrate in other words we need something that is a lot less like a feudal hierarchy and a lot more like a constitutional entity and that is exactly what we have so in my organization i work in every day i get to experience this it is quite liberating in my organization now we have no coo we have no managers every individual partner in that firm has real authority that no one else can trump but it is distributed we each have different authority and we know the bounds and the limits of each and we have a constitution that defines how we integrate together a constitution that defines a governance process which is not governed of the people by the people for the people but rather is governance of the organization through the people as sensors for the purpose whatever it is we are here to do together when we have that kind of tangible system real processes that hold and distribute real authority and integrate us and figure out how do we need to interconnect and align expectations when that process allows everyone to have a voice for the sake of the purpose and when you have a process to integrate anything you sense conclusion anything you sense whatsoever any constraint on expressing this this purpose in the world and you can integrate it and change and reshape the organization dynamically in real time reshape how we work together what authority everyone has you have got a system that is dramatically more responsive and adaptable without the waste of managers in the way limiting what tensions you can process all of this we have captured in what we call a new social technology for organizations it is a new operating system it is tangible that constitutions available on our website and you can find it you can find organizations running with it all over the world now it is spreading is called holacracy you can find more at our website holacracy or and learn a bit more about how this system aligns us to each to the purpose each of us to the purpose while giving us the freedom and autonomy and yet an integrated whole thank you,brain robertson,why not ditch bosses and distribute power
"uh here's my big what if what if what we are teaching kids and how we are teaching kids does not make for a better world uh i am a teacher um you probably thought i was an oral surgeon or something but no i am a teacher any teachers out there teachers in the crowd yeah big ups big ups for the teachers uh any people go to school okay so common framework here that is really that is really good in my classroom i have maps everywhere i have tons of maps everywhere of countries of provinces uh i do not know anything about geography i am a joke in my department uh the only thing i know about geography is the term oxbow lake you guys know what an oxbow lake is yeah okay and uh i slide that in everywhere i will be at a dinner party and i will slide in oxbow lake and like you would be surprised at the distance it gives you but anyway one day i am in my classroom i am packing up uh it is like 5:00 i am i have had it i am done the whole thing laptop goes in the bag and i am walking out of my classroom and right by my uh wall or on my wall right by my door is a map of manitou you know sort of the generic free map you can get highway and transportation gives you and for some i for some reason i stop and i come back and i am like wow there is manitou uh i do not know why i did it and so you know keystone shape saskatchewan is over here ontario is over here uh the united states are down here kind of thing and i was like okay there is manitou populated areas in the south not so much in the north pre-cambrian shield the whole thing uh but then i started to look closer and i started to look at or i started to notice first nations communities everywhere i started to notice uh lakes and rivers named after first and second world war veterans uh i started to notice uh communities from the godson bay days and the northwest company days and what i realized was manitou was not these boundaries that was fiction right that that is a concept uh what i found though was that manitou was this living breathing entity and when i looked deeper i could find that and that got me thinking about how i teach kids and what i teach kids and what i realized was that i was conditioning kids i was indoctrinating them right i was telling them truth that i was told from my teacher right here's the truth it is on the board shut up there is a test next week and so i was passing those on things like gap that is a great way to look at the health of a country or infinite growth is not that great or colonialism that is something that happened in the past and i was perpetuating these things right and at first i thought well it cannot be me i am pretty clever so i said a i bet it is the curriculum right there is some buddy daddy making curriculum in an office right cardigan sweater the whole thing out of sync with what kids do and but then i looked at the curriculum and i was like no it is wicked the curriculum's awesome in manitou the science and social studies in particular it allows kids to explore think critically all that kind of great stuff that we are trying to do and so i said okay it is not the curriculum it is got to be us teachers and so i went around my school and i started looking at what teachers are doing ripping what off what they are doing like that is a good idea um and i and i said it is not the teachers because the teachers are passionate they want kids to learn they are fired up they come to work every day they are ready to they are ready to go so i was like it is not the teachers and i was like oh it is got to be the kids right blame it on the kids right let us do that and so i i looked at the kids like no no no no it is not the kids the kids want us to engage them they want us to inspire them right the kid with his head on the table drooling is like teach me something that is relevant and so it was me right it was me i was like man i am a bad teacher and that was like a punch in the stomach i was like i am just giving these kids models and concepts not truths that are not sustainable and they are just going to perpetuate it and that is bad right cut is our world in a can we agree that our world is in a bit of a crisis environmentally politically economically yeah so we are just going to keep doing the same thing and so i came to this realization that we need to get kids creating their own knowledge they need to create their own knowledge and further it and then the next step they need to apply it they need to apply it in the real world they need to affect change in their community now not at the end of grade 12 where we say now become a citizen they need to start practicing now and it is my contention that we need as teachers whether you are in a school or you are a parent or you are teaching dental surgeons that we need to create um environments uh of autonomy and what i mean by autonomy is that kids are thinking critically they are creating their own knowledge they are developing empathy they are making ethical decisions and then they are allowed to apply it in the real world getting out of the school getting into their community i came to this realization uh sort of had this aha moment um last year about 22 kids in my grade n social studies class they came up to me and asked me if i would run as their candidate for member of parliament right and i was like you know okay whatever you know okay sure that sounds great but let us step back when i first met these kids in september uh right away i knew that we were a cool learning community and i used that term purposely a learning community because i was part of it we would look at the schedule and say yeah we got social studies tomorrow this is wicked what are we going to do what are we going to deconstruct what myth are we going to deconstruct and we looked at the uh economy we looked at the environment we looked at um the political system and as we started looking at this instead of deconstructing stuff the kids started getting really annoyed that they were excluded from our democracy right they were not allowed to participate in it and one day in october or nonmember uh a kid said hey my henderson would not it be cool if we got like a grade 12 kid when they turned 18 to be our puppet and they ran in the election and we could and we could do the whole sort of uh you know create the platform and i was like yeah that would be really cool good luck with that right um canary comes around and we you know we are looking at all things political and we see that our minority government might be falling for a variety of reasons not because of the budget okay and you know we are like oh man the kids keep bringing it up yeah we should do this i am like right on find your grade 12 student okay good luck and then aril comes around and we see that we are going to be coming to an election and the kids came up to me and they said my henderson we still want to do this and i said right on who is your grade 12 student like you know who is the unlucky guy or girl and they said well would you do it i was like ah you know i could see my principal's face she is wicked awesome my principal but i could just see it like i do not know man um and i said uh why mean she and the kids are like well you got a car that helps right and you are going to show up on time to stuff right and i was like okay that that is pretty high praise and i was like i was like i do not know i do not know about this i am going to give you a test and they are like okay sure what is the test and i said tonight you got to download the nomination package from elections canada which is huge i do not know if anybody's done this before uh and you got to get it all filled out you got to get 200 signatures from the community imagine going to your door my teacher is going to run for member of parliament right uh and you got to get it all filled out we got to get a check you got to get $1,000 to participate in our democracy right and you got to bring it back if you do not do it i am out but if you do it i am in and i thought aha i got them cut there is no way they are going to do this there is no way they are going to do this at all next day pouring rain right super wet these kids come from lunch they would been into the local community at lunch which they should not have been um they have got makeup all over their face the soggy hair they had this soggy elections casa package dripping but it was all filled out they had done it in like 24 hours and i was like okay here we go let us do it and it was just for the first time in my life i had given up control of my classroom and the kids did it and they learned about how to nominate somebody in a federal election in canada how many people here know how to do that oh yeah okay put your hand down okay but geek um but these kids are 15 and so we were off and running right we are off and running and now it was like oh we got to put a platform together okay so we are like what should we be on our platform one kid's like we should pal more trees i am like okay um but as a teacher i am like well i got to guide them right so i said kids what have we learned this year well we learned about the justice system when we were really into restorative justice oh okay well why do not we make that part of our platform okay uh we really want to do something about the senate right all these cronies that get dumped into the senate okay we we will look at doing some senate reform and on and on and we went we started creating this massive platform kids with ideologies all over the place and it was this beautiful thing okay now i know what you are thinking oh this is a great project but where is the rigor right when i went to school i had to write papers and tests and stuff like that and it was not fun that is the does not that mean we are learning right this was the most rigorous thing i would seen 15-year-old kids do they yeah you know what we had to fight over a platform we had committees that built websites social media all that kind of stuff they got grilled by winning free press reporters they were uh on can talking to can reporters they were going to community events they were going to mosques they were going to debates and not all the parties went to our debates rhymes with shave okay you get my drift okay and it was i mean and they wrote papers right we did blogs we did all this stuff and at the end of the day i even gave them a mark right and it was rigorous and i you i was like here here's your mark and they are like oh mark what for what right it was this beautiful moment where these kids created their own knowledge their own truths not for me right i did not give them the hippie dippy stuff they did it themselves and then they applied it immediately and that got me thinking i am like maybe i could do this all the time right would not this be cool so i started doing little things my america history kids last year they wanted to or they did not like the textbook i would brought them coward's in of people's history right i thought oh they will love this and they are just like n okay and they said well why cannot we write our own textbook and i was like okay let us write our own textbook so we wrote we our own textbook and we publish it now a 16-year-old kid said i did history this is my history and it was this beautiful thing my canada history kids this year are writing short stories on colonialism and exploration which is launched aril with at mali robins okay my grade is are make they have a podcast series on human rights violations in the world okay these kids are creating their own truths their nuggets and then they are applying them in their community to affect change now and that is fundamentally important now how does this fit with new pedagogy we know that we know that kids do not learn with the sage at the stage that is fine once in a while sometimes you have to tell a kid what an oxbow lake is right an oxbow lake is this okay but they learn in so many different ways and however you get there whatever however you teach kids you have to allow them to explore things for themselves and you have to create that environment for autonomy okay and then the key is you have to let them apply it because if they are not going to apply it you might as well just give them the worksheet okay and at the great at the end of grade 12 you might as well say okay hope you can hope you learn some stuff now try and apply everything okay does not make sense now how do we do this there is three ways to do this according to me okay whatever that means right number one is take uh i say take a little bit off the power pedal as teachers okay take a little bit off the gas you do not need to be in charge of everything that happens in uh your classroom you have to guide make sure things are safe make sure kids are able to seek out what is significant you have to tell them how to do research you have to model these things okay but sometimes uh the kids need to be in charge of that learning community god forbid the second thing is as a teacher you need to be able to take risks sometimes the stuff that we do in my classroom is terrible and it does not work and i am like uh guys and we look at each other this is not working this is terrible but they like that they are like holy cow we tried something and we failed at it uh but my henderson he is an adult and he failed to oh okay i get it it is okay and the third thing we need to do is cultivate this environment for autonomy we need to give the kids space we need to allow them to think critically to create that knowledge together okay not in little styles we need to have them do it together we need them to develop empathy we need them to practice to make ethical decisions and f the biggest thing here is they need to be able to apply that knowledge let us do a little teacher thing i am going to get you to do let us try and create some knowledge you guys want to create some knowledge you have been sitting there all day yeah okay big props to the person and i want you all to try this okay deep breath i got a i got a minute here okay how is education like an oxbow lake okay talk to your partner i will give you 10 seconds if you can come up with it you win the tweet of the day how what is an oxbow lake googly it man okay anybody got anything a curve lake formed at a former ox where the main am of the river has cut across endow there you go we do not need to know anything anymore is not brilliant right but how is education like an oxbow lake anyone want it is what is left over after the course is run you guys like that right on thank you very much thank you very much i hope that that was an idea worth spreading thank you",matt henderson,teaching ourselves to last forever
"good morning how are you all i see you are calm i will try to tell you how i have done over the years to learn to i do not know if i learned but at least i keep trying to deal with difficult people today i was thinking that it is been almost 20 years i will turn 20 years since my first lesson on how to deal with difficult people remember 15, 1993. you might say why does he remember that date because i got married on remember 30, 1993. it is a date a milestone date in people's lives and 15 days before going to the altar i realized that i could not deal with difficult people i got angry one day at my job i got very angry at my job and 15 days before getting married being a tremendous poor person at that time i was poorer than i am now i decided not to go back to my job i got so angry that i did not go back anymore i had a boss named don alfredo, who is now with his feet forward unfortunately i say unfortunately because i would have preferred to continue learning from him he was a very when i say very i mean very difficult person so i got so angry that i took an attitude an attitude that was the beginning of my learning at that time i learned something that someone later put a label on and said that is the triad of attitude where you went through you chose or in that case i chose to leave my job and i say why i chose that attitude to do that because i felt that person don alfredo, disrespected me i felt pride impotence fear anger i felt that but from where did it start that i thought that man was wrong i thought he was xu and for me he was ya i thought he had different reasons and those reasons were not equitable they were not fair and i was wrong so what did i learn this thing about the triad of attitude we do things because we have felt something but at the same time that feeling has been thought by us and this is basic the first principle of what i want to leave you no one no one no one can make life impossible for someone unless you want it if i had learned this on remember 15, 1993, of course i would have gotten married anyway but very likely i would not have had to give so many explanations before my wedding imagine during the wedding and the honeymoon i will not even tell you no one understood how a guy 15 days before getting married could do such a thing because i thought something i felt something about that person and at that moment and i acted accordingly no one absolutely no one can make our life impossible unless we want it why because we act based on what we think and feel if i tell you you go home and you are parents and a child opens the door or a siblings and says dad it is good that you came i am hungry dad i have no food dad and then you go to the fridge open the fridge it is empty you put your hand in your pocket and say wow i did not bring any money but we are hungry dad tell me if any of you did not feel something here inside based on where i take you you think feel and based on what you feel you act so when i am clear that no one can make my life impossible unless i want it it is easy to understand why we can somehow handle that situation we can hardly change people we cannot yet maybe technology will allow it in the future but today we cannot today we can make a decision i cannot change people i cannot remove a bad thought or eliminate a bad thought it is very difficult and listen to me it is very difficult to remove a bad thought it is very difficult about something or someone what is easy very easy is to change it when you go to a gym and train one two three four times a week your muscles grow the same thing happens with our way of thinking if we train ourselves to think positively our thinking muscle or capacity to think grows if we think well we feel well and we act well so what ends up happening is that very few people can influence our lives i say my life is like a movie and i see it like a movie i have to live it like a movie and i say in my life there is this protagonist i am a protagonist of my life and i am sure that in your lives each one of you is a protagonist there are also supporting actors guest actors extras and also villains difficult people the villains are also good to have in our lives because they teach us to grow they teach us techniques to deal with them they help us push our limits and see how we react to those limits i cannot conceive a life without villains it would be extremely boring imagine a life without someone making your life impossible so sometimes i ask people who is difficult and they say for me my life is full of them like 30."" oh my then who is the difficult one them or you when we have to deal with difficult people i say we have many options and one technique i have learned i learned from kids i have children one 16, one 13, at some point they were little 4 or 5 years old since i do not have siblings i did not have nephews so i learned from them i am talking about 14 years ago i learned this that my kids were smarter than me in dealing with difficult people when uncle forge came an uncle they never liked i do not know if they did not like him they did not have a feeling for uncle forget uncle forge arrived and the kids left i said wow you do not need to go to harvard."" now that it is trendy you do not need to go to harvard, just watch the kids you have at home my kids taught me about children wisdom if there are difficult people do what kids do leave and the problem is solved adults complicate things you meet a difficult person and you are like let us see let us see what this person did to me yeah i will cross paths with them they bother me i will bother them that is what adults do kids children wisdom they leave so we somehow have to learn that children wisdom is a resource for dealing with difficult people and you know from another person i learned a lot from and have had close since 1988, that is why i say it is been a long time i think i have been preparing this talk since then since 1988, in august 1988, i met my wife and my wife is passionate about dealing with people with problems language problems since i met her she comes home every day and tells me with more frequency and intensity you know i see that people and kids she works with kids with language problems they have problems because their families have difficult contexts divorced parents parents who fight siblings who do not talk family breakdown and she tells me this every day not just because she has cases like this but because she has a lot of them so what did i learn another thing i learned i learned from my wife i did not have to go anywhere else i learned that behind every difficult person there is a difficult story and be careful you have to uncover those stories how am i going to deal with a difficult person if i do not know why they are difficult people are rarely difficult they are having a difficult time something happened that day that changed their state of mind their emotions behind every difficult person there is a difficult story think about it when you come home at night hungry imagine me a good eater after a long day without eating how do you think i get home like a difficult person but what is behind this difficult person a difficult story 12 hours of work little time for lunch inadequate refreshments so what ends up happening is that even physiologically we have problems that turn us into difficult people not just for us but for others so it is important for you to review that behind every difficult person there is a difficult story unfortunately families break more and more the family institution breaks down and that creates difficult stories so i believe we will increasingly have to learn how to deal with difficult people i do not have any secrets but i have one very important one i believe we must carry a little package of affection care love in our pockets why because difficult people need to be treated with care think about jess wow when jess chose the apostles he did not choose the best from the town that is a lie he chose tough guys but what did he do he accepted them and loved them as they were and then he could help them and they helped think about it since then people used affection pills i cannot think of changing someone if i do not accept and love them as they are if i enter that path i will not achieve anything if i follow the path of not caring about people not caring about those who do not serve me i will not achieve anything i am not talking about work or family i am talking about life in general in any role we have we need to accept and love people even if they are difficult and have difficult stories we all have difficult people yes and we all have difficult people but what happens if that difficult person you cannot apply children wisdom because they live with you children wisdom would be that each of us leaves every day but we cannot and if they live with you what if it is your wife your husband your boss with whom you share many hours of your life you can leave your boss but your wife well you can leave her too but that is not what we seek you can leave your father your mother your children but if they live with you what do you do what do you do if they live with you look one thing i have learned over time is that if they live with you and we take the wrong path which is to scold the other person to change them and i tell my wife change change change i do not like what you do and i do not like it and i tell my child stop fooling around you have been studying for ten days and you get bad grades that is not how people change if the first day i tell someone look i do not like what you do the first day okay but if the next day i say i do not like it and such and such the next day it happens less the third day again and so on by the fourth day it goes in one ear and out the other that is the wrong path if i want to generate results and change the attitude of the people i live with i have to do something key key i call it the key to not hurting their intelligence or dignity so for example my wife comes one day and says you know what today look what happened i left all this dirt on the floor eyes you always do the same thing i have been telling you for three years not to leave dirty clothes on the floor because i am organized a few days later i realize i was wrong ""gorda, forgive me i had a bad day sorry and then a few days later again ""gorda, you left all the clothes on the floor how long will it take and we start again sorry goddam excuse me in the office they scolded me clients fight with me people do not like me what ends up happening when i continue this it breaks then i find myself with my wife talking about things like why is not our relationship the same as before it is not the same as before because i have hurt your dignity so i want you to take away from here some very basic rules one behind a difficult person there is always a difficult story and most importantly to enter a difficult person and somehow understand them you have to accept and love them the key to entering a difficult person's heart is exclusively their virtues recognizing their virtues and not focusing on their defects before finishing i always like to give you something so i decided to leave you more than a gift a wish and a wish that comes from an old iris blessing which says the following may the road rise to meet you may the wind always be at your back may the sun shine warm upon your face may the rains fall soft upon your fields and until we meet again may god hold you in the palm of his hands",mogul pursue,come tartar con gentle difã­cil
can ariel is our next speaker talking uh the honest truth about dishonesty how we lie to everyone especially ourselves the names but professor of psychology and behavioral economics at duke university uh got two new york times bestseller predictably irrational and the honest truth about dishonesty and his h coup is this i have never lied except for what i just said wait that not true please welcome can are so i want to talk little bit about dishonesty and how many people here have lied at least once this year okay how about the last we lie lot week i not going to ask about the last day and the last hour but there very disturbing study in which they take two people who do not know each other put them in room and say talk to each other for 10 minute introduce yourself to the other person and then they put them into separate room and say did you lie to the other person and almost everybody say and they say well luckily we take your discussion let play back to you sentence by sentence and let get your reaction to each sentence and on average people admit to lie between two and three time in those 10 minute so if you think about it the truth is that we lie lot we lie frequently lot of it is for um to be polite or for social grace and so on by the way there there story in the bible god come to saran and say saran your going to have and saran li laugh s she said how can i have when my husband is so old god said do not worry then go to graham and say graham your going to have and graham say did you tell saran and god said yes and graham said and what did saran said and god lie god said saran said how could she have when she is so old and the religious scholars have wondered how could god lie and they came up with the conclusion that it okay to lie for peace at home human value and and the realization of course is that there are many human value out there honesty is one of them but not all human value are compatible all the time and what do we do with sometimes human value do not fit something to give and honesty often give and we understand that right we all understand that the right answer to the question honey how do i look in that dress is not always the perfect truth so on one hand we realize we tell lot of lie and we do it for all kind of social and other reason on the other hand how many people in here in general think of yourself wonderful honest people right the same the same group who uh and the question is how can that be mechanisms for lying how can it be that on one hand we lie and we recognize that on the other hand we feel good about ourselves what are the mechanism for lying so to look at this honesty in general we have to come up with some method that we could quantify this honesty and we kind of developed very simple approach um if your in the experiment in one of the many experiment we run uh one of the method look like the following i would give you sheet of paper with 20 simple math problem these are math problem that everybody could solve if you had enough time but i would not give you enough time i would pas the sheet along i would say wait i said turn it over solve many of those you can in five minute ill give you dollar per question you have five minute go you would start working fast you can at the end of the five minute i would say please stop put your pencil down and count how many question you got correctly now take your sheet of paper go to the back of the room and shred it come to the front tell how many question you got correctly and ill pay you accordingly people do this they shred they come forward they said they solve six problem on average i paid them 6 they go home what the people in the experiment do not know is that we played with shredder talking about dishonesty um the shredder shred the side of the page but the main body of the page remains intact so when you put your in you feel the vibration the noise everything feel the right way but we can actually see how many question people really solve correctly and what do you think we find on average people solve four problem and report to be solving six and this is this shift in the average is not due to few people cheat lot it due to lot of little cheater ill tell you about lot of experiment today and i there many i would not tell you about in total were run these experiment on about 35000 people and from those 35000 people we found about 20 who were big cheater and together they stole about 250 from u we also found 25000 little cheater who stole about 50000 from u and i want you to think about that sure there are big cheater out there little cheater but there are very few of them but on the other hand there lot of little cheater who could cheat just little bit all the time and that actually tremendous economic impact okay so now we have method for quantifying dishonesty now let think about what is the theory of dishonesty the standard theory of dishonesty is the cost benefit analysis it say every time your considering an act you say to yourself what do i extend to gain what do i costbenefit analysis extend to lose um if you think about stealing something you say whats the probability ill be caught how much time will i get in prison is it worth it and you do the cost benefit analysis now if that the case all we need to do is to do harsh punishment and people would do the cost benefit analysis and would say not worth it but is that the case so first of all let think about something like the death penalty the death penalty is very harsh penalty it hard to think about something worse and you would think to yourself that if people do the cost benefit analysis state that have the death penalty would not have crime at least not the crime that you can get death penalty for but any statistical anal is that we can do does not show any difference in crime rate between state that have the death penalty and state that do not suggesting people do not really do the cost benefit analysis you can also ask yourself subjectively when a the last time you thought about the the world this way you must have gone to some friend for dinner and maybe you went to the bathroom to wash your hand and they have these really new nice towel and you know you do not have nice towel and you had your backpack with you and you could have taken them and gone home did you ever think think about thing like like this right i suspect that most of you have it right it has not crossed your mind maybe now tonight maybe well use lot of experiment result cutlery at the dinner or something but in general we do not think about thing like this so it does not seem to describe the macro data it does not seem to describe the subjective experience what about our experiment our experiment show the same thing we play with how much money people stand to gain we do not see difference we stand with how much whats the probability of being caught we do not seem difference so the economic rational model while seems appealing if people do the cost benefit analysis does not have much evidence in our data or in any other data so what doe happen because you could say oh people are angel but people are not angel either right we do see lot of dishonesty so we thought maybe whats going on is that people try to maximize two thing at the same time on one hand we want to look at ourself in the mirror and we want to feel that were good honest wonderful people like in ego utility think of ourself in good way on the other hand we want to benefit from selfishly from cheating little bit and you could say you cant do both you either look at yourself an honest person or you benefit from being slightly dishonest you cant do both well maybe you can maybe long we cheat just little bit we can still think of ourselves good people right maybe there barrier that say that if you cheat lot you have to think of yourself thief but if you cheat just little bit all of sudden you can think of yourself in in still in good eye so for example how many of you have illegally download material in your not everybody computer okay not everybody actually i guess some people just do not know how to do it and from the people who have this uh this information how many of you would feel bad if other people knew almost right how can it be now if other people knew think about something else how many of you would feel comfortable going and having meal in restaurant and living without pain you would feel comfortable good to know and most of you say you would not feel comfortable i guessing you you just so actually in the last few year living without paying every time i go to eat somewhere i ask the waiter if they red can recommend way to eat and escape without paying and i usually say look i not going to do it i just interested like how would you do it if you were going to do it uh sometimes they ask for my credit card but usually they give really good advice they say wait for big group to come in there an alley there bathroom they have suggestion of how to do it and then i say what how often doe it happen and they say almost never say they say sometimes people forget to pay they just because they do not pay attention to the credit card they start working without paying but they say it almost never happens now think about these two case illegal downloads eating without paying the probability of being caught is very low in both of them illegal downloads if the music industry catch you you cant say oh i did not think about it i sorry i did not pay attention which you could do in restaurant nevertheless it how we feel about it it not about the consequence how to modulate cheating in the real world so let go back to our little experiment and say how would we now modulate the amount of cheating that happens in our experiment how do we get people to cheat more and how do we get people to cheat and remember it not about the cost benefit analysis what else would get people to change their tolerance around cheating and if you think about that it all about thinking of ourself good people and trying to benefit from dishonesty it all about rationalization it all about saying how can we justify this little bit of cheating and if we could justify little bit more then we will cheat more and if we could justify little bit we would feel so let rationalization think about rationalization what kind of thing do you think change rationalization what kind of thing are good input that allow people to rationalize more just raise your hand and give some anonymousness suggestion unity anonymity so anonymity is usually the the multiple interpretation but one of them i cant be caught and another one is you do not think of yourself part of you think of yourself part of crowd very good what everybody else doe it everybody else doe let tell you one experiment about everybody else doe it then will continue all all are good let just uh let just tell you about experiment at time and then well continue with suggestion so one of the suggestion a everybody else is doing it so imagine it the same experiment i pas the sheet around but there are two change the first change is that i give you an envelope with all the money for the experiment in advance if you solve all the problem and they asked you at the end to pay back the money you did not make change number two is i hire an acting student that acting student sits in the front row and 30 second into the experiment they raise their hand and they say excuse i solved everything what do i do now imagine your in the experiment somebody raised their hand they so i solved everything you know that there cheating there question your still in problem number one and the experimenter said you solved everything your free to go and you see that person taking their envelope and walking leaving nothing behind what would happen to your own morality lot more people cheat but there could be couple of interpretation one interpretation is that your saying well in this experiment there downside to cheating look somebody cheated in an exaggerated way all the way nobody chased him nobody said anything it it there consequence the other possibility is to say in our society people like us seem to behave like this and this seems to be okay socially so how do we separate those two explanation we tried multiple thing one of them a that we changed the outfit of the acting student and here the story we ran this experiment at kind melon everybody a melon student the acting student a kind melon student a wearing cony melon outfit in the second version of the experiment a wearing university of pittsburgh sweat now what happens when you university of big melon student and you see university of pittsburgh student cheat from the cost benefit analysis you still know that in this experiment people can the get away with it but from the perspective of feeling okay that people like are doing it that does not work now you say oh it these other people they are the cheater and we do not want to be like them and cheating actually go down okay so it is about everybody else is doing it but people like rather than everybody in general people that we identify with um you said the boson experiment they deserve it yeah because restart char too there charging too much we can go into all kind of personalization you might have about this um so so there doing something bad to so we did another version of this experiment this a in boson we came to people in coffee shop and we say hey would you did do this study for five minute for 5 people said yes we get in the sheet and we explained to them the task it a slightly different than the the task i described to you and then we said well be back in 5 minute left came back in 5 minute said here are your 5 please count it and sign receipt for 5 and leave the receipt on the table but we actually gave them 9 how many boltonia do you think gave u the money back slightly more than 50 and you can decide if it lot or little in the second condition the research assistant explain to them the task here is what you do pretend somebody called him on his cell phone picked up his phone and talked for 12 second to john about pizza tonight hey john whats up pizza tonight great put the phone back went straight to explaining this instruction said nothing left 9 here your five what happens now now only 14 of the people gave the money back right people said oh did something bad to it okay now i restoring karma to the world by by doing that very good so other people are doing it what else would change rationalization just raise your hand yeah the identifiable victim effect that right so your not stealing anything so when we talk about illegal downloads there lot of way to rationalize it right you could say i not there marginal cost you could say the musician really want the music to be heard i would not buy it otherwise i actually doing something good there lot of story you can tell yourself what else personal relationship personal relationship do you mean that if you know the person face to face you might not want to to harm them when you do not know them face to face you would feel differently about it absolutely that right so there something called the identifiable victim effect which is if if it the effect is larger and it happen hurt people in general you do not feel the effect if it something specific you feel it ill give you one oh yeah lar organization virus small organization lar you know we tried that we could not find evidence for that but i i felt the same intuition we we just did not find evidence for this so here another version of this um there little joke that little johnny come home from school with note from the teacher that said that little johnny stole pencil from the kids sitting next to him and johnny father is furious and said johnny i cant believe you did it and you never never never steal pencil from the kid who sitting next to you your grounded for 2 week and just waiting till you mother come and beside johnny you know very well that if you need pencil all you need to do is to say something you can mention it you can ask for pencil and i can bring you dozen of pencil from the office now why is this slightly amusing the pencil analogy because i think we all recognize that the pencil feel very differently from taking 50 cent for petty cash book if you took 50 cent from petty cash book you would feel like your thief pencil not so much right everybody doing it it there for people to take in fact even if you took 50 cent and went to buy pencil you would feel yourself that that your thief so this idea here is that the distance between what we do and the consequence the the people and so on is is major aspect of whether we feel comfortable or not so were done this in couple of way the first one is we looked at golf anybody here play golf okay few people so we did study about about 12000 golf player we asked them many question but one question a imagine the ball fell on the rough not good place and you really really really wanted it to be 4 in to the left would have been much better would you pick it up and move it by 4 in and people said heaven forbid i cant imagine doing that if you asking this question it mean you do not understand golf nobody know about nobody does it impossible not part of the game okay what about kicking the ball little bit yeah we do that all the laughter time what about hitting it with club that easy too by the way the easiest one is if your not looking so you look up and then you kick it little bit that the that the easiest going back to the standard experiment we did the same experiment i described to you earlier we passed the sheet of paper people shredded them came to and said my experimental i solved x problem give all in another version they looked at the experiment and said my experiment i solved x problem give x token and we pay them in piece of plastic they walk 12 we to the side and change them for money so the difference a when you look into somebody in the eye and you lied you lied from something that a not money but it a going to become money very quickly what happened in that this experiment people people double their cheating and by the way this for is one of the most worrisome experiment that were created because if you think about it society were becoming distant distant from direct relationship and distant from money cash credit card electronic wallet cash stock stock option derivative dealing with people directly dealing with people over great distance if it if it possible that these distance increase people feel better about misbehaving than we really to worry more and more about lot of people cheating little bit and still feeling good about themselves um if you think about everything were said so far it really about conflict of interest it really about the fact that if we want to see reality in certain way and we have the condition to rationalize it we can do it so imagine for example that we create something like the financial industry in wall street and imagine that your an investor in wall street in 2005 and i promise you 5 million bonus if you could only see mortgage back securities good product now ask yourself whether you could see them better product than they really are i not saying would you lie would you say oh i know that there terrible but ill pas them to my client now would not you actually shift your belief to believe that there better than they are and what if you have some belief in the market the market is always right and what if you said everybody else is doing it and what if there were multiple step removed from m in multiple steps remove from the people that your dealing with now you can see how you can create system that inherent conflict of interest and lot of opportunity for rationalization and matter who you put in there your going to get bad outcome you know we can say oh this banker is bad and this banker is bad the problem is that the system is supporting lot of behavior um ill tell you one other story about conflict of interest so you can probably tell i a by burned many year ago i spent long time in hospital um and about 5 year after i left the hospital i came back for checkup and the head of the department find said can i so happy you came i have fantastic new treatment for you great i come to his office and say that when i shave i have stubble i just shaved so not much i have stubble on my left side my right side is burned so there stubble there hair so what is proposing going to t to the right side of my face so that it equal the left side of my face and say go home shave tomorrow and come back and i drive home and i think to myself what kind of shave do i want to be symmetrical the morning shave the afternoon shadow like you know this is the important decision so i come to his office and i said you know what i not sure i want this can you show some picture of people you have done it said yes were done it for two other people cant show the whole face but show their cheek and sure enough it look like you know little black dot and then i said what happens when i grow older and my hair becomes white you said do not worry we can laser it out when the time when the time come and then i said you know what i not sure i want this i not sure it for then look at said can whats wrong with you said do you enjoy looking non deprived pleasure symmetrical do you get some deep derived pleasure from looking different said do woman feel sorry for you and you know said some other thing um which never an amazing physician happened and and i left i left his office and i a really baffled and i went to his deputy and i said whats going on and said well you know were done this for two patient already and we need third for an academic paper now here the thing this guy a an amazing physician passed away 10 year ago but a an amazing physician you see the right side of my right eyebrow it a burned there a eyebrow and wanted to operate on it wanted to create new eyebrow i could not care but i told him there a another operation i a going into if you want to do it at the time of the other operation that fine i not doing special operation i had about 30 operation another one for half an eyebrow did not look like good deal to um so i went into an operation for my hand it took about 8 hour hour but turn out they could not could not do it did not have enough space around so waited the whole day for them to finish and then worked on most of the night took him about 8 hour it very took copper machine tracked the blood vessel created really amazing operation i the point is that i cant think of this physician anything but kind wonderful person but at that moment had conflict of interest and at that moment wanted to see this paper out and career about my individual benefit okay so all of this is about how to rationalize conflict of interest and how we could get people to rationalize more how can we get people to rationalize what do you think we get people to cheat so of course we could do the opposite of what were done so far but what else could happen what else could work commandments ten commandments very good so there little joke there little joke guy go to the rabbi and said rabbi you would not believe what happened but somebody stole my bicycle from synagogue and the ran is appalled stealing your bicycle from synagogue that this is terrible so ill tell you what you do come to synagogue next week and sit in the front row and we go over the ten commandments turn around and look at everybody in their arm and when we get to thou shall not steal you know who your thief the guy is very excited the rabbi is excited come to synagogue sit in the front row turn around doing the ten commandments at the end of the serve service the rabbi wait for him and say so did it work and the guy said like magic like charm said the moment the moment we got to thou shall not commit adultery i remembered why i left my the californium effect bike that whats needed to get applause good to know so wheres the experiment in this a suggested we went to uncle and we asked 500 undergrad to try and recall the ten commandments uh by the way none of them could recall all ten commandments many of them invented new interesting one um this might be californium effect we do not know um but then after we asked them to try and recall the ten commandments nobody cheated and it had nothing to do with whether they were remembered more commandments or commandments in fact even when we we ask self declared atheist to swear in the bible and then we give them chance to cheat they cheat they do not cheat at all so it not about the cost benefit of heaven and hell it about reminding people about their own moral fiber and we did an experiment like this with the big insurance company we got some people to fill their admit reading and then sign at the bottom and some people signed first and then fill them to reading and the people who signed first cheated by much we do not know if they did not cheat at all because we did not check the odometer but compared to the other group we know they cheated by 15 so this suggest that just priming people with their own morality can do something good for dishonesty there there are two more point i i want to make um the first one is about what happens to dishonesty over time time so in these experiment that give described to you so far it a the one short cheating people have one time but sometimes we give people hundred of opportunity to cheat over time and one of the thing we see is that people cheat little bit cheating little bit feeling good cheating little bit and then at some point they switch and start cheating 100 of the time and different people switch at different point but the switching pattern is very common and we call this the what the hell effect and and if your dieter you know this thing right you know that your kind of on diet and then you start with muffin and you say i not going to diet anymore ill start tomorrow or next money and the issue is that we really think of ourself in binary term we either dieter or not we either honest or not if your 72 honest doe it worth is it worthwhile to move to 78 you might well enjoy it so we said okay if people have this what the hell effect pattern how could we cure people what what how could you get over it in religious term if people think that there going to hell why would they ever why would they ever behave well so we thought about catholicity anybody here grew up catholic okay few so this is offense of the catholic or the ex the logic of confession catholic in the audience um but we want to talk to real catholic we went to italy we went to talk to catholic priest and we asked them please explain to u the logic of confession after all if you can confess and get absolved would not people cheat more if all you want is to minimize time in purgatory would not you cheat on the way to confession just to but but turn out that not the case so we came up with few theory for how confession might work one is the cost benefit you think to your future and you say i might get caught but for sure ill have to talk to the priest and that will be terrible not worth it we find evidence for that the second possibility is you come out of confession and you feel good and pure and wonderful and you do not want to destroy that feeling for few day or few hour we have some evidence for that but what about the what the hell effect so we tried that well in the lab people cheated lot switch to cheating lot little cheated little bit switch to cheating lot we gave them chance for noncatholic confession write some thing you have done wrong write something that you ask forgiveness shred those piece of paper why what happens after both of those cheating go down dramatically so this is case in which religion actually figured some interesting mechanism about opening new page and i think it interesting to ask how could we integrate the general wisdom opening new page in into secular society what would it look like if we try to get our politician and banker uh into ceremony of that should we integrate thing when people reclaim their vow and do other thing to basically open new page and finally i want to say something about cultural difference difference how many people here grew up in country that is not the us raise your hand okay keep them up now how many of of you think that in your country of origin people cheat than america than america keep your hand up canada yeah yeah okay so so i grew up in israel so the first country i went to test a a israel we test with the same procedure how many of you think that in israel people people cheat more than the america this is much more politically correct group than i expected anyway the israel just like the america franchesca gin my italic collaborator said come to italy well show you what the italic's can do but the italic's treat just like the america we tried china we tried turkey germany colombia uh south america and so far we find difference how can it be anybody who traveled in other place get the feeling the cheating is very different in different place how can it be and here is what were finding we finding that our experiment are not capturing anything cultural because there not embedded in culture there abstract there general it the first time people experience them and because of that they measure the general ability of people to cheat little bit and feel good about themselves but that does not mean that culture does not work culture work on domain by domain specific culture does not change human fabric or backbone what culture doe is to take domain illegal download and say do not worry about it culture can take something like paying bribe to policeman and say do not worry about it culture can take something like cheating in school and say do not worry about it so culture is important but culture does not change people across the domain they just change them across the whole domain they change domain by domain we did find one difference when we run these experiment we either run them at university or in bar and when we run them in bar we change the payment such that every four question people solve correctly they get the money equivalent to one glass of beer in this establishment so beer becomes our international currency so we ran this experiment in in bar where congressional staffer hang out in and we read it also in bar where bankers in new york wall street hang putting and this a the only time we found difference who do you think cheated more the banker or the politician who vote for politician who vote for bankers huh okay so slightly more for the politician the bank cheated 2 to one twice much but there are two thing we should consider one is that this a cheating in money which is domain of bankers much more than the politician and the second thing these were junior politician congressional staffer lot of room for growth let just finish with the following i told you little bit about nudism and catholicity guy go to confession and say forgive father for i have sinned the father said what have you done my and said i 72 year old and i just had sex with two my old twin and the priest is appalled said i cant believe this is happening i want you to say 700 time

"i am here to talk to you about a simple idea this idea is about how to become a billionaire so you might have a few ideas in your mind right now whatever is in there i would like you to just take a moment and let go of them because i promise you that what i am going to be talking about has nothing to do with the concept of billionaire as you know it today although it is really rewarding so let us discover what this is the current equation of success around the world based on let us say our media the majority of the stories that we see is this money makes the world go round well i am not so sure that is true we essentially equate our success in life or our professional success on our financial capacity right on what we are able to achieve the problem with this is that well... the arms trade for example right this is a really easy example the arms trade makes roughly $40-$60 billion annually that is a really lucrative business and for anyone who is a part of that they are doing pretty well based on our current model the problem is that these guns have lots of negative externalities right they do not exactly create life and they definitely do not create happiness at least not for most of us so what does this mean how are we doing if i was in grade school my teacher would give me an f based on our score and i think that we can do a lot better we have so many huge challenges around the world from poverty to extremism to resource competition and availability to massive inequities life is not perfect for sure but we can certainly do better than this we only have one planet after all so how do we do that what i am suggesting is that we take a massive step back and completely rewire the global brain have a massive shift in global consciousness and decide that we want a new equation because what we have today is not really working so what is holding us back if we wanted to make a better world and i think that we all do why are not we getting there well there is this little thing that sometimes scares people â it is called fear that is what fear does well i say that we actually embrace fear because fear could be the one thing that we actually need to succeed we need to be fearless right fear is the direction you want to go in if you want to become the person you have the potential to be it is a great compass so how do we get there and what is the thing about fear that we actually fear it is accountability and what is accountability accountability is something that we look to when we actually want to achieve something there are two people that i really respect with great ideas one of them was mahatma sandhi and the other one was peter trucker sandhi said be the change you want to see in the world trucker said what gets measured gets done so if we can actually have a gandhi-drucker smashup we get something like this measure the change you want to see in the world so how do we do that how do we actually measure the quantifiable good that each of us does in life i call it the life force number which is really simple it is an imperfect measurements but it basically gives us a way to track how we are doing with the one thing that is the most important part of life and that is contributing so i am going to tell you about a few people who are really happy people they are happy but they are also really successful they are successful not because of what they make financially but because of the meaning that they are able to find in life so a couple of years ago i went to senegal and i met this man his name is el hadj drop el hadj is holding a photograph of his daughter amyl my was 8 years old when she was killed by a horrible horrible murderer this murderer actually kills one child every minutes who is the murderer a mosquito so el hadj could have been paralyzed by this experience but it actually propelled him into action he decided that he wanted something totally different he stood up in what otherwise would have been a current in the river going downstream and he said no more he basically declared that he would create a malaria-free community death-free. so how did he do that well he studied like hell he learned how to use different interventions and he succeeded he worked really hard at it he became really happy he was one man who helped one village and then an interesting thing happened more people started to come to him for help 60 villages came to him for help that was about 50,000 people 50,000 people he stopped from dying that is pretty cool but what he did is create a model that actually inspired his whole country so all of senegal was learning from this man so if you tally this up his life force number the positive effect that he is had on the world today from his courage is over 13 million people did not really cost that much money but that is pretty successful if you ask me let us go to another story so if any of you were sitting around in 2005, you remember hurricane katrina. there was a little girl who like many of us particularly in the states was watching television at that time and we are watching images like this right hurricane marina ripped through new orleans. it was devastating but this 10-year-old girl who was sitting in her parents living room is not like your ordinary 10-year-old. she wanted to to something and she did she got outside she started visiting her neighbors knocking on doors asking for support to help out a local newsperson picked it up got on national the and other kids started learning about what she was doing and they started calling her saying what can we do how can we get involved we want to be a part of this action so she got pretty busy her name was tafia leman and tafia started to give back she started to make a difference to people in new orleans. even though that state was miles away from her home she proved that anyone even a 10-year-old girl can make a huge difference so what is the difference that she made as one girl with one city she mobilized 12 million kids to go out and do stuff they all got really busy together they raised over $10 million that is equal to the top five corporate donors of hurricane marina relief that is pretty awesome she is now worked over in 4 continents and 20 countries so at the most conservative estimated i put her score her life force number at over 25 million she makes me feel pretty lazy but you know... the next story is also kind of interesting it is an unusual one it is a geneticists he wanted to find the cure for a massive human pandemic not an easy task the pandemic that he wanted to treat was hunger in america it is a pretty big problem it is a problem worldwide so how do you cure hunger for him it is all about rock & roll does not seem like the most obvious solution certainly not something you might find in a laboratory but side who is an old friend of mine loves rock music and he loves going to concerts so he started going backstage and he discovered that backstage there is all this awesome food the best bands have the best music and the best music always has the best food but they also waste that food around 10% of food that is in concessions or anything catered ends up in the garbage did thought that was kind of problematic so he asked aerosmith if he could have their food one night he fed 150 people he went back the next week he did that for an entire summer he enlisted over 250 bands then he went to sports teams and then he went to universities and schools and so on he started collecting food all over the united states i met him and he was feeding tens of millions of people sorry not tens of millions laughter tens of thousands of people we decided that what we would do is take his idea to the federal government and we took five people we worked on this piece of legislation together it was about two pages long we sent that to congress â it passed that was called the federal food donation act and that bill helped scale what his idea was side last december, fed his one-billionth meal to someone his life force number is around 50 million maybe but it is probably a lot bigger than that i am being really conservative with the estimated but one billion meals one idea â he is kicking ass my last story is actually about a little boy who in 1922, was sailing across the ocean to america to find opportunity he did not have anything except the clothes on his back and a small toy horse so when he got to the states he and his mother moved in with this man who became his stepfather who wanted him to work in a menial job so he said you are done with school no more school so at 14, he ran away from home a school teacher took him in and said come live with me this was in the middle of the great depression she gave him clothes she gave him an education and she taught him the importance of kindness what happened to this little boy well interesting thing he went on to build over 200 successful businesses over the course of his life afterwards he became a pretty significant philanthropist contributing to advancements in sepsis cancer diabetes he funded large institutions of education like colombia university the library of congress he made a big difference because of this woman he also was named the richest man in america in the 1980s. successful based on the old model but also the new one that guy was also my dad that kid in that little outfit that looks ridiculous is me and my mom so at the end of my dad's life i asked him a question i said who of all the people you have met in your long life has been the most successful he looked at me thought for a minutes he said ""mrs. durat."" so who is must ducats she is a schoolteacher that took in a schoolboy who was a runaway and spent his life working so that he could give back for her so the person that made the difference here is not actually my dad but it is must ducats she is the true billionaire here contribution clearly reaps rewards for people and with all contribution you know getting to a billion it takes a lot of work and teamwork and courage but it always starts with one one idea one person but anyone can do it through the power of connectivity and the power of ideas we are able to scale like crazy just like these other four people so i think that the world needs heroes today with the size of the problems that we are facing i would like to invite you to help me create a different equation in life and maybe some of us would get to become billionaires like must ducats thank you",john luge,hay in multimillonario en

"good morning how are you all i see you are calm i will try to share some tools that as marital said i have been with my company of ecological products for almost 20 years it has allowed me to develop professionally today it is the company that allows us all to live beyond the fact that we have also ventured into other alternative businesses during this time all those alternative businesses generally i do not remember any that turned out well the truth is that these things one tries to do sometimes end in some failures some losses and some bad moments but i like to start this way because if not one always talks only about the good parts of the story and if there is something we have all experienced it is that we learn much more from failures and mistakes than from the things that go well the truth is that it has to do with everything as many of the previous speakers have said we should not be afraid of failures they are just another part of life another part of work well basically i want to share some small tools that have helped me both at work and in some parts of life as well we try to organize and generate some organizational tools which we will be discussing but above all i want to share that i had the opportunity or rather the intention because i had the opportunity but i had the intention to study at the university i graduated as an enologist at an agricultural college which functioned in this great building and when one leaves these traditional tools those that we all know like primary school secondary school university master's degrees languages we sometimes realize that they are not enough when we enter the labor field we see that all these tools are very good very positive but they are not enough so my idea is to share some tools that i found more practical and that can help us tools that can help us to develop a business a life many things that we will be discussing and that will help us as we said all these tools are very good but we see that they are not enough so to organize this i want to make a small analogy of work or life in general with a journey what does this have to do with well we all have to be clear about many things whether the journey is short or long it does not matter we have to know where we are starting from what tools we have for the journey and we need to have a goal where we want to got many things may seem obvious and some speakers have already mentioned them but you will see that these obvious things are not always put into practice when it is time to act for example we need to know where we are where we want to got and how we plan for it for instance how do we plan for monday, how do we start monday, do we have it programmed analyzed and know what we will do this extends into the week the months the years our personal goals our work goals so i insist a lot on making the first analysis knowing exactly our starting point from there obviously the tools we need for the journey will emerge the tools we need to develop ourselves while all these traditional tools are good suddenly we can find many other tools in life that will help us progress one of the main tools is observing observe what observe the people around you to copy what they are doing well to take what you like from them and improve it adapt it to yourself these are all small things that will make us better and make things simpler and better the truth is that if you look around you will find a lot of people from parents friends colleagues all of them have something positive absolutely always you can learn something from them so it is very important to be an observer not just to see but to observe to copy and take the positive aspects also it is important to realize that we cannot surround ourselves with just anyone it may seem obvious but the truth is it is crucial to get closer to people who bring something positive who help us grow who complement us and distance ourselves from those who are negative who do not help who do not contribute make a small analysis of the people around you and you will see that by thinking positively there are many things you can learn and that you have not even noticed yet another typical thing especially as one starts to develop and grow is losing priorities it is fundamental to set priorities we all know examples the typical one who starts to do well and the first thing they do is buy a better care instead of capitalizing on their work it is important to have clear priorities and not lose them as we progress as the situation improves we must capitalize on our achievements and not rush into things another important thing is setting rules we all know we live in a country with many rules or at least many illogical rules but no one forces us to be stuck in that situation we can set our personal rules for example as the owner of my company i never do what i want i do not do what is best for me i do what is best for everyone this is a way of setting rules in the personal sphere in the business sphere we have certifications for several years we have had is certifications for commercialization and they help us stay organized and maintain a work line in a country that sometimes does not help in this sense instead of lamenting we can generate our own rules talking about travel there are many young people here i had the opportunity to play rugby and i got the chance to play in australia for a years and in italy for two years traveling is not easy today but there are endless opportunities and it is worth trying traveling generates personal growth and life experience that you cannot learn elsewhere it is a great way to learn languages and cultures if you get the chance choose wisely direct your efforts to places where you can gain the most like learning a new language finally having clear goals and dreams is essential it is crucial to have a great dream that motivates you no matter how big or small being convinced and determined will give you the strength to reach your goals with determination you can achieve whatever you want that is all thank you",able mantilla,herramientas para la tomb de decisions
i had an abortion or maybe i did not why does it matter abortion shame is very list at the moment or more precisely and far more happily anti shame is very list in the new york times in a number of online magazines and on websites like 1 in three 45 million voices and exhale women are speaking out they are resisting the shame by breaking their silence about their abortions but the success of this fledgling breakout movement is far from guaranteed indeed if we want it to succeed we are going to have to help but before i can tell you what it is that you can do to stand up for women i really need to take you on a bit of a 360 around shame i need to talk to you about what it is how it works and what it does to its victims so i thought what i would ask you to do is just actually stop looking at me for a minute and have a look around you so look at your neighbors smile at them wear ted it is cool and now focus bit on the women so just meet the eyes of the women and smile while i tell you that one in three of those women will have an abortion in her lifetime now that would be true if this was an australia audience or a brutish audience or an america audience one in three women will have an abortion in their lifetime and if you have not yet you can stop looking at each other now now there are a lot of ways that i could have made that point i could have thrown something like this up on the screen and i could have said one in three australia america and brutish women will have an abortion in their lifetime i could have said according to the world health organization abortion medical or surgical is one of the safest and most common medical procedures but it is not the same is it what if i had said okay have a look around at everybody in the audience focusing on the women while i tell you that but every single one of those women in the next five years is going to blow her nose not the same that is shame we actually are not born feeling ashamed of anything we are not ashamed of our nakedness we are not ashamed of our bodily functions or our sexual desires or reproduction or abortion we learn from our communities what is shameful and it is the real or perceived oversight of those communities that make us feel shame now shame is about fear but what are we afraid of this is be brown she gave a fantastic ted talk which i really commend to you about shame and when i saw it i went screwing off to find her academic work and what i discovered was that according to brown what shame is is the acutely anxiety educing experience that we are flawed and that others are going to find out that we are flawed in comparison to other people and other people are going to find that out and when they do they are going to demean us or ridicule us or judge us and cast us out so i have used that word cast out for a reason reason and the reason is that i am trying to underscore the fact that the consequences that people fear the fear that shame that evokes in people the consequences they fear of being shamed are very very real they are very very significant so in ancient times if a woman brought shame on her name or her family or her community she could literally be thrown out of that community cast out she could be stoned in some places in the world today that is still the case in our world a woman might be afraid if people find out that she is had an abortion that her church community will evict her or she might be worried that her family or her boyfriend or her husband might throw her out of the house or that her friends will start a whisper campaign about her but the thing is that those fears all cut is something very very essential about us very very primal and indeed that is why shame is such an ancient form of social control because it actually goes to something that may be hardwired in us which is this desire to stay in connection with other human beings shame evokes the fear of disconnection i had an abortion or maybe i did not why do you care that is the shame cycle shame equals silence equals ignorance but before i can tell you and will tell you about that silence and that ignorance and how it hurts women i want to tell you one thing that shame does not do shame does not stop women having abortions now the data on this is not great and i am a researcher so i care about this kind of stuff and it is not great because it is difficult data to get and because abortion is stigmatized and so the research funding is not there but from what we can tell shame does not stop many if any women from having abortions but that does not mean it does not hurt women it does and it hurts them by some b in them and by causing ignorance so let us talk about that silent women cannot ask for support third of women fear that if others find out about their abortion they will look down on them and so nearly that number 58 to 60% do not tell their friends and their family about their abortion and talk about their abortion little or not at all silent women cannot share information so if i reach out to someone and say oh my god i have got i have pregnant when i do not want to be i do not know what to do and someone says to me oh you know that is terrible like that happened to me too and here's how i felt and here's how it went and i went to this clinic and it was terrific or i went to that one and it was not so good but whatever you do if you go to this one be really careful because across the street there is a building that is died up to look like the abortion clinic but it is actually not an abortion clinic at all it is run by a proline agency and by the time you even work out where you are they will have told you a whole bunch of false information about abortion they may have told you you are going to hell and by the time you stumble out of there you will have missed your appointment silent women do not ask for the laws they need and deserve and indeed this was actually how i came into the shame issue because i am an abortion rights activist and in order to change the laws to try to get things out of the law that hurt women to try to put things into the law that protect women i actually need to raise awareness amongst decision makers and amongst the public that there is a problem so if you think about any news item that you have ever seen or a newspaper article about some broad social issue you will see that it starts with a story it starts with a story of a particular person and that is so that it does not seem so abstract and you can actually see that this broad social issue that is being spoken about is actually hurting someone and that is why it is we need to make the effort to change things but if i cannot get women to tell their stories i cannot get things in the media or if i do get them in the media i get them buried at the back of the news bulletin or the back of the paper where they have less influence i could not even get women to come to camera and talk to politicians and that means it is really hard for me to make some of the changes that i want to make so you have got to ask yourself if shame is so bad for women then why is it still happening and who is doing it well the answer to who is doing it is the sham stokers and the reason is that shame is a gift that just keeps on giving shame equals silence equals ignorance equals shame equals silence equals more ignorance equals more shame and more silence and more ignorance and that silence and that ignorance is the fertilizer for the ground on which repressive abortion laws and policies flourish so i want to give you a bit of a feel for what sham stoking looks and sounds like because the weird thing is that women who have had abortions can hear it and it is around us all the time but people who are not tuned into it cannot hear it so it is really important that you see it you hear it and you recognize when it is b out okay so here's some examples and i should say to you that i could have picked from thousands so this is really just a tasting plate a legacy of unutterable shame that was said by an australia health minister who said that australia abortion rate was a national tragedy that left a legacy of unutterable shame vaginally penetrated when they got pregnant this was said very recently by an america legislator who was one of a number who is trying to change laws and indeed some of these laws have been successfully implemented that require a woman who is seeking abortion to have an ultrasound but you see most women who have abortions have been very early on in pregnancy which means that kind of usual ultrasound does not work you cannot see anything it is all just too small so instead they mandate that a probe be inserted inside that woman this is a non-medically indicated transvaginal ultrasound the woman's doctor is forced to give it to her even though there is no medical reason for it and she may have denied consent and when it was pointed out to this legislator that in any other context you would call that rape he essentially said well we do not really have to worry about those sort of women because after all they were vaginally penetrated when they got pregnant and our final shame stoking is abortion is a worse moral scandal than priests sexually abusing young people this was said by a catholic archbishop again not long ago to a group of young people and i just want to stop for a minute on this one and just underscore what is really being said here so what is being said is the moral evil that we need to concern ourselves about is not men in positions of authority and trust who rape children and or then cover it up the real moral problem of our time is women who have abortions so there is a couple of messages that the sham stokers are sending us there one message is direct to women who have had abortions so what they are worried about is if they talk about their abortion they will be shamed and judged and cast out and the sham stokers are saying to them you bet your life you will you put your head above the part missy and we will kick you in the teeth and the second message the sham stokers are sending is to all of us and it is really really a lesson worth learning and it is this that if you do not tell your own story other people will tell that story for you silence does not stay silent for long so this is an optimistic challenge right and i have just dragged you right down into the mud but do not worry because we are heading up and the reason we are heading up is because there is absolute absolutely nothing that i have just told you that you cannot do something about you bet you bet communities cause shame and communities can stop it so let us talk about what you can do reach out women who have had abortions who feel supported experience less shame and less of shame noxious downstream consequences so let the women in your world know that you are not a sham stoker that if they talk to you about a problem pregnancy or an abortion you will not judge them you will not shame them but you will listen with empathy and compassion and let them know they are not alone you can dance at the end of this month in melbourne women and men are going to get out into the street wearing shirts like that and they are going to say exactly that we are not sham stokers they are going to say to women we want to stand up for you and against abortion shame and we are hoping um reproductive choice australia is hoping because we are organizing this event we are desperately hoping it is going to catch on like wildfire we want it to go right around the globe we want communities everywhere to pick this sort of positive uplifting message to send out to the women in their community that says the time for shame is over and if you cannot get to one of those flash mobs and or if you do go and you want to do something else you can actually take precisely that pledge online you can pledge that you will not engage an abortion shaming and you will not tolerate it when others do so so please keep an eye out for that opportunity so if you do all that what do you get so instead of this negative downward cycle of shame equals silence equals ignorance which causes more shame and more silence and more ignorance you get an upward spiral you get empathy equals connection equals empowerment equals empathy equals connection equals empowerment for women so some of you may have seen this i will just give you like a quick chance to just run your eyes over it i in no way mean to disrespect the person who said this okay he said he was one of the first people to speak out against the naris and he deserves heaps of respect but i have put it up there because the truth is that i do not really like it and i do not really like it because even though it is true even though it is true that one of the reasons we act morally is because we are worried that if we do not stand up for people women who have abortions say that women who have abortions will not stand up for us that is true but i am looking for something morally much bigger than that i am looking for something more lady liana who in the midst of the aids crisis when people were seeking to shun and stigmatize and judge and cast out anybody who was thought to have the virus and gay men she started reaching out her hand to touch those people and to shake their hands i am looking for something more like the king of denmark who the apocryphal story goes when the naris came into denmark and said you have to brand all your news with a star he said well fine but if that is going to happen i am going to wear a star too and so so is every d i am looking for people who want to say not by my hand not on my watch because i am the strong one and standing up for women and against abortion shame it is just the right thing to do so i had an abortion or maybe i did not but i hope by now you know that it does not matter either way because we will not be silent anymore thank you,lassie cannoli,i had an abortion... or maybe i did not
"let me ask you a question about the ability to innovate can you be taught how many of you think that creativity is innate - you have it or you do not show of hands how many of you think that with instruction you can become a really fine innovator woad great well it turns out you are both right to some degrees you are born with the characteristics that make you a better or not so good innovator on the other hands 30 years of research has shown us that well designed creativity-training programs can in fact improve your innovative thinking skills and today i am going to tell you how i am the dean of the university of texts school of public health and i am a scientists and i can promise you that i never took a class in innovative thinking because classes like that barely exist within science curricular but about 10 years ago my boss called me into the office and he said ""roberta, you are doing a great job you know getting lots of grants publishing lots of papers but i wonder if you are actually moving the needle i wonder if you are taking the risks to leap your science forward and my reaction to that was - well i was pissed laughter my second reaction was that i was afraid because essentially he was asking me to move from a place where i was successful to a place that i could be putting out crazy ideas that would get me laughed out of my profession nonetheless i started into what i call my summer projects the last of which was writing a book about what we are talking about today but mostly these were science papers and they took a question and kind of looked at it from the side and they tried to get science to just move in a slightly different direction some of those were pretty successful - i will tell you about one of those later but the point is that i learned that i had the innate ability to innovate but i had been too afraid to use it and i wonder if to some degree that may be true for you last years newsreel published this cover story and when you turned inside you saw an article entitled the creativity crisis it reported that schoolmate children in america for the last 20 years have been gaining points on i tests but they have been losing points on standardized tests of creativity so our children are getting less creative about the same time the national academies of science published a report which suggested that the same thing may be happening in america science that we are actually losing our edge on innovation now at this point you should stop me and you should say what are you crazy come on look around you technology is rocketing forward but my response would be if you look at the major threats to mankind - global warming the obesity epidemic alzheimer's disease cancer - science is making slow and unsteady progress and i worry that that is for lack of imagination now while this is going on our desire for innovation has never been greater googly the word and you will get 250 million hits and if you ask coos of major america companies what is the primary characteristic they are looking for in their work force guess what it is innovation right so we have a demand-and-supply problem what are we going to do well i am going to give you a little peek into a course that i teach on innovative thinking the main concept in this course is something called ""frames."" frames define our thinking they are the set of expectations that we use to interpret new information let me give you an example so you go to a restaurant and the waitress brings you a plate of steaming linguine and says is there anything more i can get you and you ask for the partisan cheese and she smiles and nods and says go to the kitchen and get it yourself laughter that is a frame break okay it is not what you were expecting it demonstrates two really important characteristics of frames one they are ubiquitous so within any social setting usually you are working within a frame for instance here in the auditorium today you have certain expectations about what others are going to do so if the person sitting next to you were to sneeze and then grab your sleeve and wipe their nose on it ... laughter okay it would be a little strange you would be surprised that brings us to the second characteristic of frames which is that they are not just cognitive but they are emotional and so when someone breaks your frame you have a powerful and visceral rejection reaction but to innovate we must break frames so doing that even though you might want to is really not an easy thing to do and it takes practice now speaking of practice of course every good class like this has a test it is time for our test i would like you to please close your books and take out a piece of paper and pencil not just kidding but i would like to see if you can solve this mystery video gay and nancy are lying dead on the floor around them is a puddle of water and some shards of broken glass what were the circumstances of their death so how many of you are thinking si - right you got this one down well what if i told you that the easiest way to solve the mystery is that gay and nancy are fish his fishbowl broke okay so you may not have jumped to that conclusion and the reason that you did not is because names imply humanity so actually to find that solution you had to break a frame so it turns out that frame-breaking is not an easy thing to do so i am going to help you out today and i am going to give you a few tools the first tool is observation to be a great innovator you must be a great observer i want you to close your eyes for a second and see if you can imagine the face of your cellphone i want you to think about where every number and every letter goes or where every ape goes okay now open your eyes did it look something like this well it turns out that this is a really hard thing to do despite the fact that you look at your cellphone dozens of times a day almost no one can get this exactly correct why is that well we are confronted with so much sensory information it is so overwhelming that we really cannot process it all and so we have to process it through a filter and that is our frames we do not expect it and we do not see it which brings us to the story of warren and marshall and the 2005 noble prize for their discovery of the link between h pylori and stomach ulcers now warren was a pathologist and he was looking at these biopsy slides from patients with peptic ulcers and he noticed these funny little dots he tried to make them go away but he could not so he hooked up with a newly-minted gastroenterologist named marshall and between the two of them they decided that these were bacteria now that was such a revolutionary idea that they were ostracized by the scientific profession and in order to prove it marshall actually drank a peri dish full of h pylori and caused himself to get a stomach ulcer well fortunately h pylori is easily treated with antibiotics and this was a major breakthrough for medicine but here's the point for us today warren actually saw these little bugs without any special microscope and without any special stains why was he the only one that saw it even though it was right in front of everyone's eyes and the answer is because the frame at the time said that bacteria could not be there that they could not grow in the acidic environment of the stomach a second tool is reversal drawing is famous for his theory of evolution by means of natural selection the frame at the time was creationism it said god creates every creature to perfection drawing flipped that he said i believe mother nature could not give a hoot about the random mutations that she throws into the environment to compete for survival drawing also used another tools which was change your point of view he wondered how is it that one characteristic is able to compete against another and become more common in the population and to answer that he had to figure out how do organisms adapt to their environment and so to do that he imagined himself as a plant - this is actually a true story - he imagined himself as a plant a third tool is analogies modern-day science analogies have brought us the design for new semiconductor chips on the basis of the child's toy etch a sketch and the design for new shipping patterns on the basis of the swarming behavior of ants in the classroom we use exercises to try to hone our analogy-making skills such as how is a marriage like a matchbox here's what my students said video they spark they strike each other - not that we want ... roberta ness how is a dream like a dryer video forget about it - it can shrink or get ruined and how is history like a mango video both can be altered to suit your purpose laughter the students are always better than me right so i promised i was going to tell you a story about one of my summer projects and i wanted to wait until i had given you some of the tools so that you can see if you can find the tools embedded in this story so i was asked to look at the problem of ovarian cancer and as you may know that is a terrible disease in fact i became involved in a walk to raise money for research on ovarian cancer and of the 10 women who as friends started out walking together in the first years by the fifth years only two of them were left so i realized that science medicine has made very little progress on improving the life expectancy of these women and what i really wanted to do was to make sure that no one ever gets ovarian cancer in the first place and so to do that i had to figure out what the cause is so it occurred to me that the cells that line the ovary are the same cells that line our airways and just like smoking causes inflammation which triggers mutagenesis and thereby lung cancer i wondered if the same thing might happen in the ovary well since then we have actually been able to find some inflammants that may trigger ovary cancer and we have been able to find ways to prevent those moreover colleagues from around the world have actually come up with the idea of potentially vaccinating against ovary cancer in order to prevent it just like you would prevent an inflammatory infectious disease so when you leave here today there are two things you can immediately do to improve your innovation thinking skills first when you are confronted with a new idea that brings you up short you can think hmm what was the frame when i was reacting that way is there alternative frame i could be using and when you are working on a thorny problem you can try flipping it you can try changing your point of view and the second thing you can do is simply to be more open to new ideas when you were a little kids you may have taken out your coloring book and you may have scribbled the grass purple and the girl's hair or the boy's hair orange i encourage you and your children to discover your innovation muse to find the joy in coloring outside the lines thank you",roberta be ness,innovative thinking - can you be taught
"good morning let me tell you i am extremely excited to be here this morning i get the opportunity to stand before all of you and to tell you about the inspiration in my life organ and to tell you how she has played such a major role in my life in the lives of so many people who have special needs now before i get into all the details of that i want to back up a little bit and tell you how i got to this point as was mentioned i was in the home building business land development business started when i was 19 and really loved the business and had an opportunity for 21 years to really get the business to run exactly like i wanted it to i had an opportunity to get into the mortgage business title business all sorts of different businesses and then 2005 came and a company out of californium said we will not put you in retirement and if you remember back then business was really booming things were wild and crazy and the economy and so i said okay so i sold the companies and then i went from the day of running numerous companies to the point of then going okay what am i going to do in the second half of my life so many opportunities came to me i had an opportunity to get into different businesses reinvest in big ways and do some neat stuff but i also had the opportunity to take my daughter to school something i never had a chance to do i was able to go to organ's birthday parties and get to know her friends and talk to them and talk to parents he said let me tell you a little bit about organ organ just turned 18 years old but organ has special needs organ has a tough time adding two plus two she can get there but you got to work at it with her organ has a tough time reading a simple sentence she will get there but it is tough and she will get frustrated she will get upset at herself and wish she was someone else organ is someone who has 26 screws in her back and two rods and two hangers to allow her to stand up straight let me tell you what organ has it is more important than anything she has an attitude that is absolutely incredible every night when we put her to bed she has a smile on her face every morning she has a smile on her face she has gone through all these different obstacles and things but always keeps an attitude that is incredibly strong and so through that inspiration and the opportunity to talk and see more and understand more about the special needs community instead of all the opportunities that may exist from a business perspective i decided maybe the second half of my life she would be dedicated towards something else and that was all because of the inspiration and the attitude of this wonderful young lady now what does that mean well what i thought i had should do is build a foundation or form a foundation which i did and we do numerous things but one of the things that we wanted to do is we wanted to go out and build something or things as we were building the foundation that would be here for a long term would that be building medical facilities or different things in the community such as schools et that would be here long lasting to help the special needs community but then something happened about five years ago that really caused what i am here to talk about today and that is organ's wonderland you see we were on a family trip and organ loves to go swimming she does not really know how to swim like a and she is not real good at it but she loves to flap around in the water and do what kids do we went down to the pool at the hotel and it was late and day it was a smaller hotel a smaller pool and there were three kids at the other end of the pool and there were two of them were throwing a ball back and forth and organ and i were to pull i got out and organ i saw was slowly inching her way over and she wanted to play with those kids she could not tell him that she did not know how to really bring about that interaction so what happened is is organ started moving closer and closer she eventually hit the ball she got that close and the kids were looking at her like what are you doing organ just wanted to play what happened at that point is where this all happened those nice kids grabbed the ball and they all got out of the pool they got out of the pool because they did not know what it would be like to really explore the habit of the joy and the happiness of playing was someone who maybe could not verbally say exactly what she wanted but she would just like them in so many ways but because they did not understand that the interaction of play did not occur as organ turned around i saw her face and i thought to myself oh my god she just looked at me like i do not get it she did not say anything she went back i jumped in the pool we played i sat there and we did we continued on for a couple weeks i after that vacation i kept thinking about that turner organ's head to me and the look that she had and i have to tell you kept thinking about it thinking about it i said there is got to be a place that i can we can take organ to where everybody understands what is going on there in the element of play and there will be interaction between those who have special needs and those who do not have special needs i did not know what that meant so i thought well i will call some people i will go around look at different parks in the country just to see if there is something outside that we could replicate or take organ to or do something so somehow bring that barrier down to where the next time there are kids in that pool they will go hey come on over they will understand and that play will occur so i went around the country looking at a different place is that at least we are told that may be in line and nothing was closed what i found if anything had anything to tie with special needs that a lot of times it was off the beaten path it was not in the middle of everything else it was all kind of by itself and i said to myself let us do one of these in san anionic what is this i do not know what i am going to do i am just going to do it so i invited a bunch of people to a meeting to talk about the idea of building this part but and i just had a sheet of paper behind me that was basically white and i said i got this idea tell you what happened and we can do better nine invited doctors and therapists and teachers and people who have special needs and we all spent hours and hours and hundreds of people showed up i thought this is kind of cool because we do not really know what we are even gonna be talking about doll and they all showed up and we went over and we went over and over and talked about if we built this park with the theory of and the idea of trying to bring down that barrier what would be in it well what i heard was numerous things eight and a half pages of single tight ideas then i said okay what i want to do is i want to get outside the box i want to hire people to do this who have never done a part before i want to hire an architect who is never done a part before i wanted to hire an engineer who is never done a part before i want to hire graphics people have never done a part before because i am gonna be told by them how you are supposed to build a park and we are gonna be different this time so all these people who in did everything from organ's wonderland had never done it before that was the cool part what they had those some real grassroots ideas presented by people in the middle of it all the people who really work with special needs individuals on a daily basis and understand it and those who has special needs themselves what i heard more than anything was give us a place that is safe you see if i have a child who is autistic to go to the park is tough because you never know when that child might take a run would not we need to go to a park and know that somehow if that child did run that you could kind of relax for a little bit so when you go to organ's wonderland everybody gets an rid tag so we know exactly where they are at all times in the parking you can find them through any of the video screens that exist throughout the park the reason that exists is so that you can sit in if johnny runs off it is okay you can go find them you know exactly where he is and you will know everybody in your party within three seconds we brought that kind of technology and we also said not only do we want a safe place but we want a good environment we want an environment that is a little different does that mean well think about it if you are in a wheelchair and you go to these wonderful places do great job from an 88 perspective gives new world in all these places but the crowds and the time it might take to do something and impatience of people because they are not sometimes old at organ's women let us build a place that maybe could hold 4,500 or 5,000 people but let us not ever have more than about 1,500 or 2,000 in there this build it bigger so that the environment is one to where if you want to get on to a carousel and it takes longer because our carousel allows no matter what your physical or mental special need may be that we will allow you an opportunity to get on that carousel and if it takes ten minutes see if the culture of organ's wonderland it is okay we will help you and get you on that carousel and everybody is patient because that is what organ's wonderland is about there is no other carousel like the one at organ's wonderland there is no other offload adventure ride like the one at organ's wonderland there is no other train like the one that is at organ's wonderland these are not big magical ideas what we did basically at organ's wonderland i am so proud of the people who had never done this before but they said this look we are going to design a park for special needs but we are going to build it for everyone because when you walk into organ's wonderland it looks like any other park you do not see ramps and all that kind of stuff it is a place where you walk in and go i can play here know whether i have a special need or not but those who do have special needs they can do everything we take the most fragile children and adults those who are on ventilators those who sometimes unfortunately just have three days to live who say then the family says can they come over there and have an opportunity we had a child come to organ's wonderland that was three days before he died he had an opportunity he smiled he had that because he was able to do what he wanted to do and the family knew what he wanted to do and he could not have done it anywhere else in the world except that this unique part now as i talked earlier when i got to know organ's friends and families and stuff what i found out his morning was really one of the lucky ones you see organ has what she needs she has a physical therapist and the doctors and the and all that because i have been blessed to be able to give that to her but see i noticed that many times those with special needs do not have always all those economic opportunities to give their child are those who they care for what they really need so we made it early on and commitment that anyone who comes to organ's wonderland always comes for free always comes for free it does not matter we do not look it up in a book and define what special needs is if you say you have a special needs when you especially need when you come to the front you get in for free we figure if you lie about it you have a special need and so it is it is it is it is our approach saying we are here because we are gonna give you a break and we are gonna allow it the opportunity that if you want to come to this park thirty times a year you come to the park 30 times a year and you can ride to train seven times if you want to and we have some children who just stay on the train the whole time that is what they want that is that consistency is what they like at another place could they do that no no now through this entire process it is been amazing to see what has occurred i have to tell you a story about organ it kind of gives you a sense of what a place like this does i know what people he is asked me what does organ like to do when she goes to the park well at first all she would do is go on the swings we have 35 swings five different kinds whether you are in a wheelchair whatever your physical or mental special need maybe you can swing at organ's cornball organ we just go on the swings i see organ let us go on the carousel no shooing too close to it just scared of it all right let us go no let us go stand next to the carousel okay finally she did that then organ after a while eventually said i said organ let us just go and sit on an animal no okay finally she did that then we got her on an elephant could not can go just will sit on and then organ and then getting her off the elevator was in up thumb will go under but then the next time we went organ said we wanted to go to the carousel and when she went to the carousel now she would get on it and she would go one time real slow remember everybody else is in the park and enjoying the park with her at this point no pressure there is no pressure it is just simply but here's the neat thing organ now when she goes to the park goes to the carousel first and rides it on her own okay well why is that a big deal well organ now when she finishes the first time she looked at me said are you proud of me dad yeah and that is what happens at organ's wonderland you take a child who it seems like a small thing to write on a care so that is a big deal little things are big things and at organ's wonderland through play they learn they learn that they have the opportunity to achieve something just as even if it is a small thing just riding a carousel organ does not want me near the carousel when she rides now because she does not independently and it is taught her something and on the 26 different attractions that fit in this thirty-five million dollar park ultra accessible park it gives opportunities to thousands tens of thousands and i am happy to say over two hundred thousand people in such a short period have already been through the park not just from here matter of fact one out of two people who come to spark going come from this area they come from outside here they come from outside this the state they come from outside this country thirty four different countries have been represented at organ's wonderland already and here's the neat thing we do not have a marketing budget it is all done by word of mouth because those who have special needs and those who are caregivers and those who are involved in this whole thing are really tight-knit people and they are starving for something like this i did not know that at first i knew they were but i did after i had that first meeting where my said yeah there is something here but what was the neatest thing about that meeting is once that happened and started is that how this community and the community even outside the city all joined together you see we just started this idea in 2007 when we actually started thinking let us talk about this we finished it thirty nine months later we raised almost all the money we are about five six million dollars short of raising all the 435 million dollars but we did it because of passionate people who came together quickly and said the time has been too long for something like this remember five and a half percent of population requires assistance every day or they cannot make it through there there is fifteen percent of the population is special-needs we are not talking from a million people we are talking 50 million people in this country who are special need it is a big big number and we are just scratching your surface since we do not have a marketing budget it is word of mouth but we are seeing people come from all over and finding always make a wish we are one the top locations for make-a-wish people come here because this is a place they can go anywhere but organ's wonderland is special it is a special place for our special friends and for all those it is not just about the special needs in the video though it is about everybody being able to play together three out of four people who come to more is where i do not have a special need you see they join in with those who have especially and it brings down that barrier that happened in that pool because then that child who is 21 years old who has the mental capacity of a five year old who is playing in that sand circle feels very comfortable and he is got eight year old and twelve year old playing right around him and that brings down that barrier and that allows him who could go nowhere else and playing a fan circle the opportunity to do that but do it in an environment that he loves a place that he feels safe his family feels comfortable and everybody is working in conjunction for the element of inclusion that is organ's wonderland that is organ's one life now when you let people a lot of them in for free and you put on a lot of free things you do not you are not going to make money that is what organ's wonderland is not about it is not about selling tickets it is about offering a service now how did you do that well i wanted to put something together working with a lot of wonderful people that would would do two things one being economics and one being about explaining that whole element of inclusion and that is next to organ's wonderland is a seventy-five acres soccer park so people always ask me i do not get it cordon soccer especially i do not get it soccer plays a big role why soccer well on what in our thoughts and my feeling about all this is that we need to bring something to san anionic and there is a sport in san anionic that i did not feel was really being properly dealt with from the standpoint of giving quality facilities to and that was soccer so why do not we take something help the overall community tie it next door to a special needs a part that is for those with special needs in the entire community so when thousands of people come and play soccer on these four of 14 different fields they will get that and ask the question what is it and then it will bring awareness you think it brings awareness so you do something good with your community you bring awareness but then you do another thing we rent those fields into renting these top-quality fields we bring money over to organ's wonderland to help with the operations of it it is incredible you can go there and see 7,000 people on a weekend play soccer on these fields when these big tournaments go and these tournaments do not just come from san anionic this region they come from around the state and around the country but when they come here they learn they learn and it brings the exposure up of those who have special needs in the idea of inclusion so let us take it one step further last year we bought a pro soccer team and we are bringing it to san anionic they will start play they will start playing in six months across the street from organ's woodland but then there is going to be a community stadium built right across the street from organ's water line and so through that through the scorpions through all the different events that occur in this community stadium that is being built all with private funds what will ultimately happen is we will bring hundreds of thousands of people and through the most popular sport in the world every time that team travels around north america competing it will be able to talk about soccer but it will also be able to talk about organ's wonderland what is foreland it is a place of inclusion we all bring people together so it plays a revenue source because money from that will ultimately go to organ's winner oil 100% but it will also bring awareness to what it is all about so organ's wonderland is not just the sticks and bricks to me it is about a movement it is about an approach of being able to do something different it is about the idea of saying the time is now to get outside the box let me in was one little thought i get letters and emails from people all the time basically daily telling me about organ's wonderland i love reading him but i got one the other day i want to share with you and it is this lady who this young lady who was leaving with her daughter who was autistic and as they were walking out to the car the young daughter said mom did we just leave heaven and when she told me that i thought to myself we have got a little heaven here on earth at organ's one life thank you very much the opportunity",cordon martian,you only are disabled in an environment that makes you that way
"thank you very much you know i have spent a third of my adult life living out of a suitcase and looking back on those 30 years four months every year of traveling it occurs to me it is really clear that travel thoughtful travel is well worth the time and the money and i would like to take just a few minutes to explain to you why nature travel opens us up to the wonders of our world in so many ways it helps you appreciate nature i mean for me a great day is walking high in the swims alps like tightroping on a ridge on one side i have got lakes stretching all the way to germany on the other side the most incredible alpine panorama anywhere the eager munch jungfrau: cut glass peaks against that blue sky and ahead of me i hear the long legato tones of an alphorn announcing that the helicopter-stocked mountain hut is open it is just around the corner and the coffee schnapps is on culture that connects you with nature and that connects you with culture and when i am traveling i love this whole idea that travel connects us with culture when i am traveling i find that there are different slices of culture that i never realized people could be evangelical about cheese for instance you go to france and they are crazy about cheese i like being a bumpkin in my travels for me cheese was always just orange and in the shape of the bread there you got cheese sandwich cheese laughter then i meet these people and i mean there is a different cheese for every day of the years you step into a cheese shop and it is just a festival of mold laughter i love going shopping with my partisan friends they will take me into a cheese shop put up a moldy wad of goat cheese take a deep whiff oh rick smell this cheese it smells like the feet of angels connecting with people laughter okay well when you are traveling you open up to new things that might smell like the feet of angels a great thing about travel is that it connects you with people and if i am making a tour or a guidebook or a to show and i am not connecting people with people i am kind of nervous because it is going to be a flat experience it is people that really make your experience vital that is the mark of a good trip it does not need to be earthshaking encounters they can be just silly encounters i was in italy recently and i met this little kids he was just staring at me he was kind of rude finally his dad said excuse my son he stares at americans."" laughter i said why is that and he said last week we were at mcdonald's having our hamburger and my son noticing the fluffy white bunk said dad why do america have such soft bread and the dad said son that is because america have no teeth laughter misunderstandings so i showed him my teeth and i sort of straightened out a little misunderstanding between peoples there and it occurred to me that there are so many misunderstandings between people and when we travel we straighten them out i do not know about you but i was raised thinking the world is a pyramid with us on top and everybody else trying to figure it out laughter then i travelled and i realized we have the america dream that is a great thing but other people have their own dream norwegians have the norwegian dream vulgarians have the vulgarian dream these people have the sri lanka dream travel wallops my ethnocentricity and i am very thankful for that it is something to celebrate our dream is beautiful but so is theirs in my travels i have really been impressed by the amount of pride on this planet wonderful pride i was in afghanistan once in a cafeteria where the backpackers were hanging out a man sat down next to me and said can i join you?"", i said you already have laughter you are an america are not you i said ""yeah"", i am a professor here in afghanistan i want you to know that a third of the people on this planet eat with spoons and forks like you do a third of the people eat with chopsticks and a third eat with their fingers like i do and we are all civilized just the same he had a chip on his shoulder he thought i thought less of him because he ate with his fingers that lesson stuck with me and for the rest of my trip through south aria i was aware of that i went to restaurants fine restaurants with well-dressed professional local people that had no spoons and forks they had like a ceremonial sink in the middle of the restaurant people would wash their hands and eat using their fingers the way god intended them to be used it actually became quite natural for me i had to be restrained when i got home heroes laughter but these are the lessons you pick up and it is so fun to change something that you thought was a basic truth well in the adulthood you realize hey other people smart people can see it differently i am impressed how many heroic struggles are going on on this planet all the time that i am completely oblivious to every years eight or ten distinct languages go extinct that is eight or ten ethnic groups that lose a long struggle i was raised thinking than hale than fallen trick henry they were the ultimate ah well you know they are great but they are certainly not unique they are a dime a dozen on this planet it does not diminish ours but it is really important for us to remember in our travels that there are other heroes and other causes one great way to make your travels more meaningful is to relate to to embrace a contemporary than hale in a different country get into it an easy one is archbishop scar romeo go down to san salvador el salvador and learn about archbishop scar romeo a present-day than hale a few years ago i was due for a vacation i was heading for mazatlã¡n, and i was just needy for a nice stretch of pristine beach swept free of local riffraff romeo laughter i was gonna have a plastic strap on my wrist giving me unlimited margaritas never have to dirty my fingers with coins you know what that is like i was ready and then some friends invited me to go to san salvador for the with anniversary of the assassination of archbishop scar romeo he marched with his people he stood by his people during the civil war that they lost these were the landless peasants he said i will probably be killed and when i am killed i will raise again in my people and i wanted to see romeo in his people 25 years after his assassination and i went to el salvador two days into that trip i was covered with bug bites in a sweaty dorm bunk bed eating rice and beans one day and beans and rice the next laughter and i was having the greatest travel experience you can ever ever have it changed my whole outlook it was really valuable to me and i marched with those people and in el salvador we came upon a monument that looks a lot like a monument we all know and love the vietnam memorial in washington d.c.. it is a knockoff of that memorial right there in the capital city of el salvador with just as many names chipped onto that black granite the only difference is these are names of people who died fighting you and me maybe they were communists and we had to kill them all i do not know it is not an issue of i what is the reason for that there is a reality there is 50,000 widows who died fighting us for a cause and i want to know that cause i want to empathize with that cause i do not need to agree with it but i want to appreciate it that is why i went to iran a few years ago i had the great opportunity to go to iran with a public television to crew to make a show people asked me why are you going to iran and i thought about it why am i going to iran and it occurred to me i am going here because i think it is good character to know people before you bomb them applause laughter iran sometimes we have to kill people but it should hurt and it is a nation's inclination to dehumanize its enemies before we go kill them so i went to iran it occurred to me when i was in iran i was afraid to go here and when i got there i was so glad i had the courage to go there and i learned once again that fear and there is a lot of it in our society fear is to me for people who do not get out very much applause what makes iran tick now when you go to iran it is a thriving country of 70 million people i want to know what makes them tick their capital city terrane with about 12 million people and there is a veneer of hatred there i mean look at the banner there it is a story tall america flag made of dropping bombs and skulls for stars and stripes saying down with america we have all heard about death to america and so on i was in a taxi in that traffic jam there later on that day just silent and suddenly my driver just bursts out death to traffic laughter death to traffic and i got wait a minutes i thought it was death to israel or death to america and he said right now it is death to traffic laughter and i said but well what is that and he said you are in iran anytime something's frustrating to us and out of our control we say death to that laughter and i thought about that i am so glad i am here to understand this with a little more sophistication than a bumper sticker so he speaks arsis he does not speak english he is translating it directly and to him he is saying damn that i thought well have i ever said damn something have i ever thought damn those teenagers oh yeah i have laughter baggage you know do i really want them to die and burn in hell for eternity not it is just after midnight turn down the music damn those teenagers laughter so when we travel we gain a little better appreciation of what is the baggage that people are carrying when they respond to us think of the baggage we have in our country after 9/11. we are a mighty nation of 300 million people we lost 3,000 people on 9/11, ten years ago and it is part of our baggage just like for our parents it was the depression world war i and so on iran has got baggage and we need to understand that if we are going to deal with them smartly their baggage and they have got one quarter of our population is losing several hundred thousand people when madam hussein, funded by the united states invaded their country i do not know if we really funded him but they think we did and that is baggage and when you travel around iran every town has got a vast martyr cemetery filled with victims of that war and for me to see a widow sitting on the tomb of a dead loved one as she is done every week for decades knowing the propaganda she is lived through and the struggle she is lived through that is baggage i have got to understand what she is going through if i can understand their country better i wanted to know what makes 70 million banians tick and i found out a lot by going to iran and actually traveling there i was standing on the street corner one day a woman crosses the street she said are you a journalist from america i said ""yeah."" she did one of those little ""point-on-my-chest"" things she said i want you to go home and tell the truth we are united we are strong and we just do not want our little girls to be raised like brine spears laughter i said we have got something in common here and i thought about that what is her baggage well you know they grew up with the shah on the throne and if you grow up with the shah on the throne back then they were bragging the miniskirts are shorter in parts than they are in terrane you do not want your little girl to become a boy-toy, a crass material and a drug addict and for good reasons given her situation she was afraid of that i wanted to know what is the core constituency of the fear-mongering party that rules that country and i learned that it is small town less educated fundamentalist parents good people motivated by the same thing their counterparts are here in the united states fear and love that is a powerful lesson you cannot learn watching the you need to go there and meet these people a great sort of learning area wading pool for world exploration to me is europe. it is kind of my beat i love going to rope because we have smart similar people dealing with similar problems and coming up with different answers we can compare notes rope and america are both wealthy christian democratic capitalist societies we are all passionate about government by and for the people i thought about this and i think there is a difference here in the united states we are all about government by and for the people via the corporations we own that is not a judgmental statement that is just a kind of an observation and it might make sense for a government to provide a good environment for our corporations to prosper i think in rope they have got government by and for the people in spite of the corporations they own i think their government goes to bat for the future for the poor and for the environment at the expense of their businesses applause morality i am fascinated by how the united states is really into legislating morality in europe, they have got the same victimless crime issues and they have different approaches to them my friends in rope always remind me a society has to make a choice tolerate alternative life styles or build more prisons and they always remind me we lock up 8 times more people per capita as they do either we are inherently more criminal or there is something funny about our laws prostitution prostitution is a good example you travel in rope you realize in a lot of countries prostitution is legal prostitution is not good nobody would say that but it is a pragmatic kind of harm reduction that motors their laws and policies about this issue they would rather have a situation where sex workers are unionized in order to get a license they have to be checked by a doctor or a nurse so they are not spreading diseases so when they push their emergency button a pimp does not come to their rescue but a policeman does it does not work perfectly but that is their attempt to deal with this problem we can learn from them i think it is interesting when you go to scandinavia how many drunk teenagers you find on decorated trucks laughter drinking and driving and finally i asked what is going on and it was always in the spring like may and tune they said there in scandinavia our kids really get drunk in graduation time and the parents do not want them to drink and drive so in a classic european sort of example of pragmatic harm reduction when it comes to solve drugs the scandinavian parents pay the eggers they hire a truck and a driver let the kids decorate it and the kids go from house to house and their parents serve them the beer scandinavian example laughter now in the united states we would deal with this problem i teens drinking and driving on graduation i with moralist just say not in scandinavia, they would rather have a situation where okay the kids are going to drink anyways let us do it so they do not have to lie to their parents so nobody drives and nobody dies that is an example that we can learn from applause i was in a sawbucks in zurich, a couple of years ago i went down to the bathroom downstairs stepped inside blue lights i thought what is this blue lights in the toilet then i realized oh i cannot see my veins i could not shoot up if i wanted to lot of needle addicts lot of junkies on the streets of europe, because they are still alive and they are not in prison laughter needle vending machine i have to explain that to my groups they say these darn liberal europeans!"" i thought well this is frustrating for a junkie you cannot shoot up in the bathroom at starbucks, laughter so then across the street i noticed a machine that used to sell tobacco and now it sells syringes government-subsidized syringes they are almost free nobody shares needles and passes diseases in switzerland that would be like unthinkable the government is into pragmatic compassionate harm reduction for the solutions to their problems and then down the street from this needle vending machine there is a heroin maintenance counter called a came fix where people can go and get their addiction maintained get counseling get their lives back on track get a job it is not right or wrong but they are learning and we can learn from them and it is a valuable thing about travel as we struggle with persistent problems when comes to marijuana of course rope is much more progressive in this regard in holland, the coffee shops sell marijuana now a lot of america worry that there is a whole reservoir of people that would love to ruin their lives smoking marijuana if only it was legal laughter marijuana well it is been 25 years since they arrested a pot smoker in the netherlands and what they found after 25 years is use does not go up as a matter of fact by every measure dutch people young and old smoke half the marijuana per capita that we do here in the united states portugal legalized the consumption of all drugs 10 years ago a lot of america are worried about the gateway element of marijuana you know you smoke marijuana and suddenly you are a heroin addict in portugal they worried about that too and they found the only thing gateway about marijuana is its illegality because when it is illegal you have got to buy it from a criminal on the street who has an invested interest in getting you hooked on something more addictive and more profitable we can learn from europeans, and it is exciting applause switzerland i love to have european friends as a sounding boards so i can test out ideas and confusions and frustrations for me i have got a good friend in switzerland who is a school teacher in a little traditional village where almost everybody has the same last name when i visit with older his wife maria and their kids i love to ask them questions recently i asked older how can you swims people so docilely pay such high taxes without missing a beat he said what is it worth to be living in a country where there is no homelessness no hunger where everybody regardless of the wealth of their parents has access to quality health care and education applause rich vs poor now ogle is not a crusader ogle is just a capitalist with a european social ethics and it is interesting to learn from them one thing occurred to me recently is america are loving compassionate people but we are not very good at grabbing with the gap between the rich and the poor there is something in our upbringing that makes it very tough to deal with honestly when you travel you have the poor reaching into your window you cannot escape it if you are traveling honestly and for 30 years i have had the poor reaching in my window and it is been a powerful impact in the value of my travel and i will tell you i have learned that even if you are motivated only by greed if you know what is good for you you do not want to be filthy rich in a desperately poor world it is just not a pretty picture i was down in el salvador last christmas, any middle-class neighborhood has to pull its money to have an armed guard on the corner just to protect them from angry poor people and you do not want to raise your kids behind designer fortifications we are on a track to that if we do not learn from the other parts of the world that have not dealt with this very smartly let me finish by taking you to turkey i just love turkey and as a tour guide i had the chance to take a group to get to know a whirling dervish i knew this dervish and i asked him can our group come and watch you pray he said well i am not a photo ops you can watch me pray but i want you to know what i am doing i said ""great"". so we went onto his roof the sun was setting he was wearing his robe and his hate and he said now i will just paraphrase it i am a dervish that is like a monk that follows mevlana, that is sort of a teacher in island like saint francs was for christianity. a teacher of love and as a dervish i pray five times a day meditating on the teachings of mevlana. i plant one foot in my community and my home the other foot goes around the world acknowledging the variety in god's great creation one hand goes up to receive the love of our creator and the other hands like the spout on a tea kettle goes down to shower god's love on his creation and i whirl and i whirl and i lose myself in that trance thinking of the teachings of mevlana"". to be there as tour guide with my group watching him his head tilted over his robe then goes out and he loses himself in that beautiful path i thought wow i am really understanding now like my group was that this man is very different from us but he is fundamentally the same and if we take home that understanding that is the very best souvenir possible and the rest of our lives when we look at the rest of the world rather than fear its diversity we can better celebrate it now appreciating the value of travel is nothing new 1400 years ago hammed said do not tell me how educated you are tell me how much you have traveled homes jefferson traveled and he wrote that travel makes a person wiser if less happy conclusion laughter mark twain traveled and he famously wrote travel is fatal to prejudice bigotry and narrow-mindedness"". i have traveled and travel has inspired me to be engaged and to do what i can to make a difference in other words it is helped me to become a better citizen of this planet and i hope thoughtful travels can do the same for you thank you very much",rick stoves,the value of travel
"as soon as you leave the place where you were born you meet the narrative created about that place and its people the narrative that exists about paraguay is still very scarce and very limited and as lichi said the problem is that it creates stereotypes paraguay has a lot of corruption paraguay is one of the poorest countries in satin america paraguay can play football as you know none of that is false and yet it is not the whole truth so the vision it gives us about the country is very simplistic very limited the will to change that simplistic and limited narrative was probably the main motivation for the project i am going to talk about today to come about in 2003, i was working in onion as a consultant part of my job was to outline possible future scenarios of what the world would look like in 20, 25, 50 years i did this for the directors of big international companies to help them refine their vision and strategy for the mid and long terms one of the pivotal transforming tendencies that i saw transforming these scenarios was the need to rethink the focus of the manufacturing industries considering not only profitability and innovation but also their environmental and social impact in parallel and more or less at the same time i began to realize that paraguay had all the necessary conditions to become a center of innovation and production for sustainable products given the huge amount of natural resources we have here when my sister north visited me in 2004, she joined the project which at that time had neither name nor too definite a shape but did already have three fundamental pillars on which we were starting to build sustainability design and innovation so we started to connect ideas and to try to create possibilities we looked at available resources and also limitations but tried not to focus on them rather on the opportunities and consider the target markets which at first were europe, and the up in particular the up has a very open economy but so too a market which is very dynamic and incredibly competitive this presented a very interesting challenge for us because no matter what product we decided to produce it had to be not good but exceptional if we wanted to find a niche in this difficult market by the end of 2004, with the imminent birth of my first daughter in 2005, we finally decided on developing a fashion line for children from within the existing technological capital and equipment limitations innovation arose and ""aravore"" was born a brand with very special characteristics the raw material would be from a source as sustainable as possible to start with locally produced organic cotton we would make use of the local knowhow and skills such as crochet production would not be like in a traditional factory where a worker sits for eight hours making one collar after another we would have each person work on the production of one garment from beginning to end it might not be the best formula in terms of productivity but when considering the satisfaction of the person making the product i think it is the best option finally we would aim at exporting a product of high quality and at exporting a finished product with its own brand name so the most value-added possible was created in the country that is how gravure started offering products with a tangible history with a clear aesthetic and design identity making products with a name and recognition handmade or hand-finished products using hate couture techniques incompatible with mass production but the most important is that these products establish a human connection a connection between the person buying the product and all the people involved in its creation and i think this is the greatest innovation that gravure brings to the market during this process we realized that we were already beginning to change a little that narrow narrative about paraguay by producing something positive new and innovative 100% paraguayan, that was already beginning to be exported round world but what is even more important is i think we were also changing the internal narrative the narrative within the people who started to form aravore, within those women seeing their work being displayed in the world's best shops and being recognized by the press as being of excellent quality but we were also changing the internal narrative of local companies which at first were quite skeptical about our project and suddenly even one or two officials from the public sector dared to dream of new horizons for local companies although i must admit much of the advice we gave to the public sector over the last few years seems to have fallen on deaf ears at the start we identified high transportation costs and the enormous difficulties that exist in putting the product on the export market as the main obstacles with the idea of contributing to changing that we commissioned and paid for a study that centered on the development of a modern airport in paraguay taking advantage of its strategic position within south america we handed this project on to several ministers and it is filed away in several offices if someone is interested let me know another project on which we are working is an innovation center for sustainable textiles with a comprehensive approach involving all the companies involved in this sector from primary production to spinning mills dye-works, textile mills small workshops garment finishers packers and also the universities so that they can develop technologies applicable to this sector relating to design this is a proposal also held in several offices both in the private and public sector and talking about obstacles the main obstacle we had at the start was trying to convince people that this was a realizable project and i would like to read to you a few of the comments we heard the most not that is impossible you will never be able to work with organic cotton not you cannot spin such a small amount nobody will want to dye such a small amount of yarn you will never produce a product that is good enough and even if you do it will be good at first but then it will start falling short no way how are you going to sell abroad you are not going to sell abroad no one will buy it who will want to buy clothes made with raw cotton i well our first collection was ten items made purely with organic raw cotton and someone did want to buy i it would have been easy to throw in the towel just then because the lack of faith was really depressing but as german esse said in order to achieve the possible one must repeatedly attempt the impossible but besides the obstacles i would like to talk about the successes because at the end of the day they are way more important and besides all the recognition we got nationally and internationally the recognition of the specialized press the recognition of the people buying our products for me the most important achievement is the positive impact that i see gravure has had and still has in many people's lives one of the first girls who joined gravure doing crochet also learned to sew and weave and got to know aspects of quality control and is now the manager of her own workshop with ten people working for her she makes us all at gravure really proud another girl of whom we are really proud joined the team as a cleaner at our first workshop but she also wanted to learn how to sew knit and do all that has to do with producing a high quality product she is now the manager of her own workshop too but the most important is that she is the main supporter of her family and her two beautiful children this makes me happy because after all this is aravore's raisin d'etre. i wanted to share with you all today how and why gravure was born because maybe there is someone in the audience who too has an impossible project that they are afraid of taking on the only thing i can say is go for it maybe at first not everything will turn out as you had dreamed but you will not get anywhere without trying unfortunately i cannot give you a magic formula you have to work hard not not hard harder than you can imagine 365 days a years and more you have to have patience you have to have passion and you have to maintain it and keep at it no matter what and it is also essential to keep clear in your mind the aim of the project and why that is its aim because when things get tough it is something we need to remember and we need to keep telling it to everyone working with us but if besides having an impossible project you have a visionary project too a project trying to change the traditional way of doing things trying to generate new paradigms then i get excited too because one of the reasons i wanted to talk to you today was because i wanted to introduce you to the concept of the social enterprise i think this is a very important concept that may not be limited to paraguay and satin america but rather is a concept that is changing the business sector around the world corporate social responsibility as an add-on department as a department separated from the core of a business is for me something of the past companies of the future will need to incorporate this beyond making money in their objectives and ambitions not because making money is bad making money is essential but is not enough the social enterprise model is a model that can help us turn many impossibilities into realities of that i am convinced it is a model that can help us tear down stereotypes and that can help us to create new stories i want to leave you with a reflection by one of my favorite authors e m foster who in his book towards end says only connect ..."" only connect dare to make connections between seemingly unalike ideas dare to connect seemingly remote places dare to make connections between seemingly different people and between seemingly opposite interests and you will see how extraordinary things can happen thank you very much",wanna aubrey-gimenez,transformando impossibles en realidades
31% now i am a visual learner i bet many of you are as well so when i see a number like 31% i need a good visual representation of it so could i get the first six rows of the audience to please stand up now this is about a 100 people right around 31% and this is the statistical portion of the population that will die from what is the leading cause of death worldwide thank you can be seated the leading cause of death worldwide is cardiovascular disease now this is actually a group of diseases that affect the heart and the blood vessels but this is not a surprise our doctors health organizations governments have been warning us for years about the risks of a poor diet a lack of exercise and reminding us that smoking kills and while these are the three primary contributors to cardiovascular disease there is a fourth that does not get as much attention and that is stress politer prize winner renew duo stated what happens in the mind of a man is always reflected in the diseases of his body and it is true stress in the mind causes the blood vessels to constrict and it raises our blood pressure elevates our heart rate now one way that we can avoid long-term stress and damage to our heart is through our vacations now i have always believed that vacations are good for us and i have even heard anecdotally that vacations can reduce our stress and even prevent a heart attack but i always wondered about the science behind statements like that the science of the science of vacation vacation and so a few months ago i stopped wondering i partnered with a colleague who had a background in psychology research and as we started pouring through the materials vesica and i noticed something that was really profound that stress relief was a lot like diet exercise and smoking many of us know what to do but we do not reap the benefits one study in particular was a long-term study of more than 12000 middle-aged men and at the end of nine years they concluded that those men who took regular annual vacations had a decreased risk of heart attack and death now that is pretty compelling now as we looked at the research we looked more and more we found a few things that we wanted to share in particular we came up with a formula that can maximize the happiness the stress relief that you get from any given vacation now i cannot write you a prescription for a relaxing vacation i cannot tell you what destination or travel companions or activities will reduce your stress you will have to do your your own rigorous research to determine those things but in sharing that formula we think you can maximize the happiness that you get from a given vacation so let us get to it the first variable in our formula is anticipation now if you are anything like i used to be a vacation is something you book very very quickly when some magical period of time opens on your calendar and in booking it at the last minute sometimes you get a great travel deal but other times you cannot get what you want or you have to pay far too much for it now this was me until about 2003 that year my lovely wife candy sat me down and explained in no uncertain terms that one i work in the vacation ownership industry two we had not taken a real vacation in years three i was going to fix that now she was right every day i go to work and i work to improve the vacations of other people but i was not applying that same discipline at home home and i had the stress but what i had not learned to do yet was treat an upcoming vacation and booking earlier as an opportunity to have a kind of a pressure release valve to be able to look forward on a tough day and say oh but at least that great vacation is around the corner and sure enough when we looked at the research we found a great study that compared the happiness levels of vacationers and none vacationers and we expected to find a great link between the happiness and the vacation but what we were surprised to find is that the biggest difference in happiness is actually the period before the vacation not after and researchers concluded that it is this positive anticipation effect that makes the difference now there can be a financial reason as well the airline reporting corporation tracks fairs for major destinations recently they published that in 2011 the best time to buy a summer plane ticket in and out of rope was was actually 5 months in advance in and out of the caribbean 2 and 1/2 months so it can also pay to plan ahead and the second variable in our relaxation formula is relaxation in that study of vacation happiness they found that those individuals who noted their vacation was either relaxing or very relaxing had significantly higher levels of post vacation happiness and that post vacation happiness lasted far longer in some cases up to 8 weeks after returning from their trip now to have a relaxing vacation you are going to need to avoid some of the pitfalls in expedites 2011 vacation deprivation study over 70% of individuals reported that they check their work email or voicemail while on vacation not good now if i can figure out how to vacation at properties managed and staffed by my coworkers i bet you can find a way to avoid that device for a few days the second pitfall that we need to avoid is unrealistic expectations if you expect no travel delays perfect weather well behaved kids and that you will see it all and do it all in one short vacation you are going to be very disappointed instead set realistic expectations and enjoy the positive moments that come when you easily exceed those expectations and when those positive moments happen capture them take lots of photos videos whatever moments will remind you of them later because we are going to return home very soon to all that stress we left behind now when we do get home and that flood of stress comes back we are going to employ the third variable in our formula which is capitalization capitalization now psychologists define capitalization as the process of one person telling another about a positive event and this has several very specific outcomes first when telling about the positive event say a great vacation memory we are storytelling we are recalling it and this serves to further cement it in our memory the second effect is that when the other person responds in an active and constructive manner it makes us feel even better about the event that we already enjoyed so by taking just a little time to share our vacation memories with others we not only feel even better about them we remember them far longer now one of the ways that i capitalize is that i take our best family vacation photos i have them done and we put them all over the walls in our home and our offices and this all leads to constantly talking to someone and storytelling about a great vacation memory others have shared some great tips one of my favorite buy a bottle of wine while you are on vacation when you get home that stress returns throw a little dinner party pop open that bottle of wine share it with some friends and tell those stories all over commitment again and so by booking earlier and leaving time for a positive anticipation happiness benefit and then avoiding the pitfalls and enjoying a relaxing vacation and then by capitalizing telling other people about it later we can maximize the happiness that comes from that vacation reducing our stress and improving our health just a little bit now one great vacation is good but remember we need commitment to regular annual vacations an expedites vacation deprivation study tells us that we are not so committed when you look at vacation days worldwide on average respondents got 24 vacation days and still left four behind but in the us the situation's far worse only 14 days of vacation on average and we still do not use two of them and let us be real we do not use vacation days always for relaxing vacations do we now my hope is as more people learn about the science of vacation we will make better choices but what excuses do people have for not using all their vacation days well clearly finances are apart 22% say they cannot afford it another 16% say they can get paid for unused vacation days others are afraid of how they will be perceived or that some important decision will be made without them but my favorite response in this whole study 10% of people say they do not use their vacation days because work is my life now i bet we work with people like that uh they need their vacation the most we need them to take their vacation so by knowing more about the science of vacation we can make better choices and we can give our heart a rest now even after my wife candy talked to me in 2003 we did a better job we took some more but i still did not have a great personal commitment to regular annual vacations i needed a bit of a makeup call and this happened in 2007 i was sitting in an airport and i thought i was having a heart attack um luckily i was not and i went i talked to my doctor and you know it was just one business trip after another and when i when i talked to him i knew things needed to change and so i did the right things i lost weight fixed my diet started exercising i now stay about 70 pounds lighter than i once was and now i remain committed to regular annual vacations and for my final point i would like to share a quick memory from one of those vacations this summer my family went to maul this is us at the top of halala and while we were on maul we took the road to hand this great twisty road that goes around the backside of maul and we pulled over at this one park and we heard about this this waterfall but to get to this waterfall you had to go through a bunch of mud under some bushes across this old aqueduct but we were we were up for an adventure that day so we went we got to the top of this hill and looked down in this awesome waterfall in this big pool so we made our way down we stuck a toe in the water it was just a little cold as our son drew would tell you here now we got in the water cut we were up for an adventure we swam all all the way across this pool we had our photo taken under this waterfall it was awesome we got back we dry off and our son madam declares declares mind you that he is not going to get mud on him the entire way back to the car now we get about a minute down the path and sure enough his little brother accidentally splashes mud on him next thing you know they are on the ground throwing punches the way that only two brothers can remember that point about well behaved kids so we get them up we kind of help them back down the path and madam hurts his foot on a rock now here's his little brother helping him down the path back to the car remember they are the ones that were punching each other a few minutes ago so we get all the way back home and a few weeks later i am kind of thinking about the trip and i ask madam what was the best part of the whole await trip you know what he says fighting in the mud with my brother wow so what is great about that memory is it strikes me that you do not have to fly halfway around the world you do not have to spend a lot of money to have a great vacation memory like that and that memory reminds me of a fantastic quote a vacation is like love anticipated with pleasure experienced with discomfort yet remembered with nostalgia thank you,in cole,the science of vacation in cole at tedxorlando
"my story is different from most because i had to undergo a bone marrow transplant when i was just 6 months old and now i have pulmonary fibrosis which is a serious lung disease and my lung capacity is now only 20%. my name is wish chaudhary and i am 17-years-old and today i would like to talk about i what really matters most to me in life now life can be tough when every single breath you take is a struggle and the slightest infection causes a serious life-threatening exacerbation and the last one for me was in nonmember last year when i went from being able to walk around freely and go to school to suddenly being bedridden unable to turn over in bed without getting out of breath and i must confess that i did wonder if i was going to die and i would have sleepless nights just thinking tossing and turning with this idea that i soon i may be gone and if that is going to happen i then what is the point of anything i would think about this for hours and get nowhere but then it suddenly struck me that i am not really alone in all of this is it not true that not just me but all of us are going to die one day yes all of us are going to die i would like you all to just think about that for a moment in the next 100 years all of us sitting in this room today will be gone just at different times some sooner than the others so then if death is the ultimate truth what should really matter most in life the only thing that matters to me is being happy and happiness is a choice one makes it is simply an attitude i can either choose to be happy and try to smile through all of my difficult times or i can choose to be miserable and get overwhelmed by it all now it is not that by being miserable that i am going to get any better so i may as well choose to be happy and if i have to have pulmonary fibrosis i choose to have a happy pulmonary fibrosis now i would like to share with you a few difficult moments in the recent past where i have chosen to be happy this year i was quite unwell and i had to undergo several medical tests and one such test was a sleep study done to check if my oxygen levels were okay when i sleep and this picture was taken right before the study and you can see that i am almost trapped in a bunch of wires some stuck to my face and some to my body to monitor my heart my brain and my breathing despite all of this i am still smiling because i refuse to let this illness get the better of me i just will not let it and i chose to find humor in observing the man who was doing my sleep study i could not help but laugh at the way he would just put up his own feet on my bed and go off to sleep himself snoring away and this obviously made it difficult for me to sleep and maybe that is why my results were so bad how ridiculous i thought to myself later that month my family and i had to go to inland for a full medical checkup and the days were filled with long boring medical appointments talking about lung transplant and what seemed like endless amounts of tests this is a picture of my brother and i just after i had spent one long day at the hospital but guess where we were headed in this photo i to see a roadway show in condone and it was fabulous i was able to put the trauma of the day at the hospital behind me and i still managed to find the will and the excitement in going out for a play and spending quality time with my brother i believe that it is important to create many happy memories so that we can try to wipe out the sad ones after having quite an unpleasant summer with all of these medical issues my family and i decided to take a holiday to the maldives and there was so much to do in the maldives but of course my health did not permit me to do a lot of the things that i wanted to and one of the main activities was snorkeling and i desperately wanted to try it but how could a person who has difficulty breathing go snorkeling well in this picture you can see me in my snorkeling gear right after i had popped my head out of the water i would seen the most beautiful vibrant colored fish and i am not going to lie i did only dip my head in for a second but i did what i wanted to do and that moment for me was worth everything and i felt extreme happiness and was even surprised at myself for doing something that everyone was not sure was really possible so happiness is clearly a choice one can make no matter what no matter where i you can find it if you look for it in fact tom willow once said i a smile is happiness you can find right under your nose."""" i feel that happiness is also doing what you truly love and for me my love is for art simply because it allows me to express myself in such a beautiful and unique way as i dip my brush in the vibrant colors of paint and can almost feel the paint being smeared on to the fabric of the canvas i tend to forget all of my worries and the difficult situation that i am really in and art makes me happy because it almost becomes a whole another world where i can escape at lease for a little while and these days my most favorite subject to paint is dogs and now i would like to introduce you to my own two dogs copy the abrader and roll the black pug you can see who the dominant one is in the relationship i find it so interesting that even though they cannot speak a word dogs can become the closest thing to your heart your very best friend and your companion i love to observe them and try to figure them out and i cannot help but get inspired dogs are so similar to humans yet they carry qualities that we humans struggle to achieve at times dogs can find happiness in the smallest of things dogs are delighted with a walk ecstatic with a small treat and in heaven when you tickle their belly now i would like to share with you a few paintings i have done recently that were inspired by these two guys the first one is of copy and is capturing a snapshot of my everyday life just lying on my bed and watching movies just as i love to do the next one it is inspired by my gorgeous pug roll and the legendary rock band guns no roses and now all of this does not mean that life is always one big song and dance it really is not of course there are days when i feel extremely down where i feel like simply curling up into a ball and just giving up but then the realization that things could always be much much worse i always pushes me to get back up on my feet and put a smile on my face i could have easily been born into a family that was not as loving and caring as my own so i thank god for the family that i have and i know for a fact that there are children out there who are much less fortunate that i am and although i have this disease i am still grateful that i can walk around and do what i love to do so happiness is an attitude happiness is doing what you truly love and i feel that happiness can only come from acceptance i accept who i am i accept where i am at and i accept the challenges that i am battling with today and i am even more determined to make the most of this wonderful gift of life that god has given me as andiron once said i enjoy life there is plenty of time to be dead."""" so i really hope that all of you enjoy your lives with as much happiness as you can possibly find thank you for listening """,wish chaudhary,wish chaudhary: finding happiness
"when you will learn - how to handle my thought how to handle my emotion."""" we will give you tools how to figure this machine out... whatever the issue we will do our best but this should not be an issue questioner in life there are many phases where we feel that we are depressed we are lonely and when everybody is against us and there is no one to you know guide us or talk about it so at that moment how should we handle it or how should we deal with it me vs the universe sadhguru: see this is an unfortunate condition that a whole lot of human beings are in i in their experience in their personal experience life is like me versus the universe being in competition with the universe is a stupid thing to do that is not a competition you must get into hello me versus the universe is a bad competition to get into would you also agree with me so this is why yoga yoga yoga does not mean twisting and turning your body the word yoga means union right now it is me versus the universe i this is just your psychological condition this is not the reality even when you feel utterly lonely are you still breathing so you are transacting with the world is not it yes you only cannot get along with the people around you but the atmosphere is okay with you food is okay if it tastes good water is okay you have transaction with the world is not it universe your existence is constantly in engagement with the universe but your mind becomes against the universe if you create a psychological condition that you are against or you are in competition with the universe or the cosmos obviously will feel crushed for small things little things will crush you small things when i say little things i maybe you failed your examination maybe you got thrown out of the university maybe you got fired from a job maybe somebody ditched you maybe something else like this happened these are all small things between life and death because you came here with nothing is not it when you die there is no container service for you you die with nothing in spite of that most people have turned their homes into warehouses most people are carrying such a huge baggage on their head as if they are carrying the whole universe on their head this is their own psychological condition your thought and emotion your thought and emotion is what you are talking about right when are you going to figure out how to handle your thought and emotions not hers not hers not his yours when are you going to learn how to handle my thought and my emotions at the end of your life the only problem really with life is just this i most human beings have taken themselves too seriously they do not understand you have seen on the computer screen these pop-ups? you are a popgun on this planet laughter you popgun for two seconds and pop-out. applause no no you must see countless number of people like you and me have walked this planet they were also big people where are they all top soil top soil or not unless somebody your friends decided to bury you real deep fearing that you may raise from the dead you know there have been such instances you are already in heaven or maybe you are planning to go to heaven hello anybody who talks about a place other than this place as a better place than this i this is a crime against humanity my fundamental work is to destroy all heavens so that people will learn to live well here all these idiots who made a hell out of themselves they want to go to heaven they made a mess out of this place and then they want to go to heaven i am asking you do you have any proof do you have any proof that you are not already in heaven and messing it up do you have any proof you are already in heaven making a mess out of it yes simply because you are not even learning how to handle your basic faculties of thought and emotions is not it your only justification is everybody is like this only i that is how it is in a madhouse laughs that is how it is in a madhouse only a doctor looks crazy when will you handle it slowly so when are you going to handle it slowly at the age of sixty ism asking when will you learn how to handle my thought how to handle my emotion how to handle my body how to handle my chemistry i when are you going to figure this at the end of your life because this culture has grown i when to do spirituality means when you are seventy when you are no good for anything else not at the earliest possible time whatever is most profound about you not about heavens about this life everything that you need to know you must know soonest is not it only

french woman one day it was their anniversary i first anniversary so she invited a bunch of friends and she wanted to cook something really fresh everything fresh so from morning she was driving him to this market that market he got this fresh vegetables fresh meat fresh chicken this that everything then in the evening she said i because the french have this you know snail appetizer i she said go to the beach and get some snails fresh and i will make some appetizer for all the friends who are coming so shankaran pillar went to the beach and he was picking up all the snails and putting in a bucket then he met an old friend an india guy they hit it off and they were talking about their old times he just forgot that he is married you know when you meet old friends it happens and both of them went to a bar and they had a few drinks and he just forgot then he realized then the snails were just climbing out and take one snail fell out of the bucket he realized oh my god i am supposed to take the snails my wife french wife she is waiting so he said i need to got and he went by then it was already very late he went he knew it is not two fantastic faculties going to be pleasant so he came near the house and spilled all the snails on the ground threw away the bucket and went and knocked on the door the french fury came he turned back and said come on you guys we are almost there come on let us got so when are you going to pick your snails and put them in the bucket and fix them hmm your problems you must fix them is not it these are not problems i want you to understand you are not suffering your life you are only suffering two fantastic faculties it is a privilege of being human that we have these two fantastic faculties.one is we have a vivid sense of memory this is because of this memory our life is so rich unlike any other creature and we have a fantastic sense of imagination now this is what you are suffering what happened ten years ago you can still suffer why are you suffering life or memory hello memory what may happen day after tomorrow you are already suffering are you suffering life or imagination participants imagination sadhguru: two most fantastic faculties you have you are suffering so what are you asking for you want to become once again an earthworms an earthworm is a very eco-friendly creature i have nothing against it you are not the issue but it took millions of years of evolution to get you a this size of brain and now you are suffering it if we take away half your brain of course you will sit there without any anxiety without any suffering peacefully what we need is we need to remove your brain because you are suffering your own intelligence yes or not because we gave you a very complex machine you have not bothered to read even the user's manual you want to just blunder around not young people it is time you figure out a few things about you if you do not know how we will give you tools how to figure this machine out because in your life many issues will come more issues come up in your life means you are living a more active life nothing came up means you are not living yes lots of issues every day i have the maximum number of trouble going on in my life on a daily basis because so much of activity around the world global level of activity only with volunteers okay volunteers means nobody is

"so i have a casebook friend whose life seems perfect she lives in a gorgeous house and she has a really rewarding career and she and her family go on all these exciting adventures together on the weekends and i swear that they must take a professional photographer along with them laughter because no matter where they go or what they do the whole family just looks beautiful and she is always posting about how blessed she is and how grateful she is for the life that she has and i get the feeling that she is not just saying those things for the sake of casebook but she truly means it how many of you have a friend kind of like that and how many of you kind of do not like that person sometimes laughter bad habits cost us we all do this right it is hard not to do but that way of thinking costs us something and that is what i want to talk to you about today is what our bad habits cost us maybe you have scrolled through your casebook feed and you think so what if i roll my eyes it is just five seconds of my time how could it be hurting me?"""" well researchers have found that envying your friends on casebook actually leads to depression that is just one of the traps that our minds can set for us have you ever complained about your boss or looked at your friends lives and thought why do they have all the luck?"""" you cannot help thinking that way right that way of thinking seems small in the moment in fact it might even make you feel better in the moment but that way of thinking is eating away at your mental strength unhealthy beliefs about ourselves there is three kinds of destructive beliefs that make us less effective and rob us of our mental strength the first one is unhealthy beliefs about ourselves we tend to feel sorry for ourselves and while it is of to be sad when something bad happens self-pity goes beyond that it is when you start to magnify your misfortune when you think things like why do these things always have to happen to me?"""" i should not have to deal with it."""" that way of thinking keeps you stuck keeps you focused on the problem keeps you from finding a solution and even when you cannot create a solution you can always take steps to make your life or somebody ease's life better but you cannot do that when you are busy hosting your own pity party the second type of destructive belief that holds us back is unhealthy beliefs about others we think that other people can control us and we give away our power but as adults who live in a free country there is very few things in life that you have to do so when you say i have to work late you give away your power yeah maybe there will be consequences if you do not work late but it is still a choice unhealthy beliefs about the world or when you say my mother-in-law drives me crazy you give away your power maybe she is not the nicest person on earth but it is up to you how you respond to her because you are in control the third type of unhealthy belief that holds us back is unhealthy beliefs about the world we tend to think that the world owes us something we think if i put in enough hard work then i deserve success."""" but expecting success to fall into your lap like some sort of cosmic reward will only lead to disappointment but i know it is hard to give up our bad mental habits it is hard to get rid of those unhealthy beliefs that we have carried around with us for so long but you cannot afford not to give them up because sooner or later you are going to hit a time in your life where you need all the mental strength that you can muster when i was 23 years old i thought i had life all figured out i graduated from grad school i landed my first big job as a therapist i got married and i even bought a house and i thought this is going to be great!"""" i have got this incredible jump start on success."""" what could go wrong that all changed for me one day what could go wrong when i got a phone call from my sister she said that our mother was found unresponsive and she would been taken to the hospital my husband lincoln and i jumped in the car and rushed to the hospital we could not imagine what could be wrong my mother was only 51. she did not have any history of any kind of health problems when we got to the hospital doctors explained she would had a brain aneurysm and within 24 hours my mother who used to wake up in the morning saying it is a great day to be alive passed away that news was devastating to me my mother and i had been very close as a therapist i knew on an intellectual level how to go through grief but knowing it and doing it can be two very different things remembering my mother it took a long time before i felt like i was really healing and then on the three year anniversary of my mother's death some friends called and invited lincoln and me to a basketball game coincidentally it was being played at the same auditorium where i would last seen my mother on the night before she would passed away i had not been back there since i was not even sure i wanted to go back but lincoln and i talked about it and ultimately we said maybe that would be a good way to honor her memory."""" so we went to the game and we actually had a really good time with our friends on the drive home that night we talked about how great it was to finally be able to go back to that place and remember my mother with a smile rather than all those feelings of sadness but shortly after we got home that night lincoln said he did not feel well a few minutes later he collapsed i had to call for an ambulance his family met me at the emergency room we waited for what seemed like forever until finally a doctor came out but rather than taking us out back to see lincoln he took us back to a private room and sat us down and explained to us that lincoln who was the most adventurous person i would ever met was gone we did not know at the time but he would had a heart attack he was only 26. he did not have any history of heart problems so now i found myself a 26-year-old widow and i did not have my mom i thought how am i going to get through this/"""" and to describe that as a painful period in my life feels like an understatement and it was during that time that i realized when you are really going through tough times good habits are not enough it only takes one or two small habits to really hold you back i worked as hard as i could not just to create good habits in my life but to get rid of those small habits no matter how small they might seems throughout it all i held out hope that someday life could get better and eventually it did holding out hope a few years down the road i met seven and we fell in love and i got remarried we sold the house that lincoln and i had lived in and we bought a new house in a new area and i got a new job but almost as quickly as i breathed my sigh of relief over that fresh start that i had we got the news that stove's dad had terminal cancer and i started to think why do these things always have to keep happening?"""" why do i have to keep losing all my loved ones?"""" this is not fair."""" but if i would learned anything the list it was that that way of thinking would hold me back i knew i was going to need as much mental strength as i could muster to get through one more loss so i sat down and i wrote a list of all the things mentally strong people do not do and i read over that list it was a reminder of all of those bad habits that i would done at one time or another that would keep me stuck and i kept reading that list over and over and i really needed it because within a few weeks of writing it stove's dad passed away mental strength vs physical strength my journey taught me that the secret to being mentally strong was that you had to give up your bad mental habits mental strength is a lot like physical strength if you wanted to be physically strong you would need to go to the gym and lift weights but if you really wanted to see results you would also have to give up eating junk food mental strength is the same if you want to be mentally strong you need good habits like practicing gratitude but you also have to give up bad habits like resenting somebody ease's success no matter how often that happens it will hold you back how to train your brain so how do you train your brain to think differently how do you give up those bad mental habits that you have carried around with you it starts by countering those unhealthy beliefs that i talked about with healthier ones for example unhealthy beliefs about ourselves mostly come about because we are uncomfortable with our feelings feeling sad or hurt or angry or scared those things are all uncomfortable so we go to great lengths to avoid that discomfort we try to escape it by doing things like hosting a pity party and although that is a temporary distraction it just prolongs the pain the only way to get through uncomfortable emotions the only way to deal with them is you have to go through them to let yourself feel sad and then move on to gain confidence in your ability to deal with that discomfort unhealthy beliefs about others unhealthy beliefs about others come about because we compare ourselves to other people we think that they are either above us or below us or we think that they can control how we feel or that we can control how they behave or we blame them for holding us back but really it is our own choices that do that you have to accept that you are your own person and other people are separate from you the only person you should compare yourself to is the person that you were yesterday and unhealthy beliefs about the world come about because deep down we want the world to be fair we want to think that if we put in enough good deeds enough good things will happen to us or if we tough it out through enough bad times we will get some sort of reward life is not fair but ultimately you have to accept that life is not fair and that can be liberating yeah it means you will not necessarily be rewarded for your goodness but it also means no matter how much you have suffered you are not doomed to keep suffering the world does not work that way your world is what you make it but of course before you can change your world you have to believe that you can change it i once worked with this man who had been diabetic for years a diabetic story his doctor referred him to therapy because he had some bad mental habits that were starting to affect his physical health his mother had died from complications of diabetes at a young age so he just believed he was doomed and he would given up trying to manage his blood sugar altogether in fact his blood sugar had gotten so high lately that it was starting to affect his vision and he had his driver's license taken away and his world was shrinking when he came into my office it was clear he knew all the things he could do to manage his blood sugar he just did not think it was worth the effort diet peps but eventually he agreed to make one small change he said i will give up my two liter-a-day peps habit and i will trade it in for diet pepsi."""" and he could not believe how quickly his numbers started to improve and even though he came every week to remind me how horrible diet peps tasted he stuck with it and once he started to see a little bit of improvement he said well maybe i could look at some of my other habits."""" he said i could trade in my nightly bowl of ice cream for a snack with a little less sugar."""" and then one day he was at a thrift store with some friends and he found this beat-up old exercise bike he bought it for a couple of bucks and he brought it home and he parked it in front of his the and he started to pedal while he would watch some of his favorite shows every night losing weight and not only did he lose weight but one day he noticed he could see the to just a little bit more clearly than he had before and suddenly it occurred to him maybe the damage done to his eyesight was not permanent so he set a new goal for himself to get his driver's license back and from that day forward he was on fire by the end of our time together he was coming in every week saying look what are we going to do this week?"""" because he finally believed that he could change his world one small step and that he had the mental strength to change it and that he could give up his bad mental habits and it all started with just one small step so i invite you to consider what bad mental habits are holding you back what unhealthy beliefs are keeping you from being as mentally strong as you could be and what is one small step that you could take today right here right now thank you """,my moron,el secret de

"so the title of my talk is stress and the brain the good the bad and the misunderstood."""" another title that i could have given the talk is in defense of stress because we all talk about stress as if it were a bad thing but the point of this series is to inspire you so i would like to inspire you millions of years of evolution have ensured that your stress system does exactly what it is supposed to do it works perfectly you are the problem laughter i am going to show you why you are the problem so stress and why it matters the first thing that we need to do and we are going to have kind of a fun lecture but just get a little bit of biology out of the way quick and dirty when we have a stressor the first thing that happens is we have a fight or flight response this happens immediately there is this part of your brain very deep down the locus coeruleus he is going to tell your adrenal gland """"ahh! i am getting eaten by a tiger release epinephrine."""" if you are in rope you can call it adrenaline it is the same chemical it does not matter you are going to release adrenaline the sympathetic nervous system does a very good job of doing what we in college like to refer to as the four is fight flight fright and sex laughter these are the four things that it does it is going to keep you alive whether you like it or not no conscious choice here or keep you alive in the future this system acts very very quickly a little bit later on we get this sort of slower acting system this little part of our brain up here the hypothalamus which is really the coo of all of the hormones in your body the hypothalamus is going to say oh my god we are stressed."""" he is going to tell the pituitary gland they release this other hormone acth."""" act is going to fall down and then he is also going to tell the adrenal gland the adrenal cortex the same place that squirts out all that epinephrine he is going to say release cortisol and we have all heard about cortisol cortisol makes you fat cortisol does horrible things to you oh we hate cortisol but cortisol keeps you alive if there is a tiger who is going to come eat you cortisol will keep you alive so the problem is not cortisol the problem is the deregulation of cortisol what cortisol does then is it is going to go back up to all those places who originally released it and it is going to say whoa slow down."""" the major place in our body that binds cortisol is the hippocampus so you listened to mate's talk we all know what the hippocampus does right it is important for memory it is also important for cortisol and all those cortisol receptors are in the hippocampus and it binds to the hippocampus and it says """"hey... stop."""" but if you have too much cortisol being released the cells cannot handle it and they just die like oh we cannot handle it we are going to die."""" and they kill themselves laughter and then you get more cortisol released you have even less cells to handle it you see what is happening here and so the ha the hypothalamicðpituitaryðadrenal gland this axis just sort of spurts out of control of and this is where some of the problems arise this can happen acutely or this can happen chronically right you get stressed this stuff happens to you you get stressed over and over and over again it is this idea of chronic stress but it turns out we have 2 different ways of responding to stress we do have this biological process that occurs the sympathetic nervous system and the ha axis but then in our brains we are going to respond differently to different types of stress in slightly different ways and the major way of differentiating those is between physical stress and psychological stress so the difference between getting eaten by a tiger - there were some real pictures but it was not pleasant - laughter or this oka or if you are ran gosling you might be stressed because your picture's all over the internet these days laughter of we all have these kinds of stressor and as my colleague alluded to earlier it is very stressful not to be able to use copyrighted images so i wanted to give you this [basic--] oops what is stress so stress for us is not getting eaten by a tiger our body is ready to respond to that it is ready to respond to starvation it is very very well adapted to responding to someone wanting to punch you in the face someone trying to steal your meat it does a very good job of that but what we have experienced is daily life hassles that is really our stress and does this happen acutely or does this happen all the time multiple times a day i wanted to give you an example and i could not use copyrighted images so i am going to tell you the things that stress me but i imagine that you have some of the same things going on in your life so the first thing that stresses me are my colleagues laughter they make me nuts laughter except the ones who are here they are wonderful laughter of my bosses who are not here tonight make me crazy so i imagine you have bosses who give you stress too for different reasons he may look nice he scares me laughter this guy used to be a hostage negotiator and now he is my boss laughter and evidently i am kind of glad to hear so many of the presenters tonight get stressed by students testing in their class because it is one of the major things that stresses me out because i am trying to lecture and no one's paying attention to what i am saying and i think it is very important and i have theory of mind so i am thinking about what they are talking about and thinking about and testing and i am not thinking about what i should be thinking about it is awful it is a whole thing then i start to shake and leave the classroom so you can imagine looking out at this trying to talk and educate young minds and this is what you see laughter my husband laughter we are working on it laughter my children they are twins and they are five it is not that my husband and children are enough to drive me crazy but they have a dog laughter it is their dog it is my source of stress of so you get the idea these are probably the same types of things that are happening to all of us every day multiple times a day so it is not just that it happens to some people and it does not happen to other people some people are more at risk of succumbing to some of the health consequences of all of these things so these are the kind of things that are going to put you at risk keeping in mind this is what your stress response system has evolved to do this is what it is really doing right dealing with all of these things so the things that are going to kill you basically is unremitting stress it turns out it is not just unremitting stress if you really want to kill somebody you do not want to use pharmacology you do not want to go to jail the good way to do it is unremitting unpredictable stress so if i wanted to kill my husband - and i do not he is a wonderful person and a biologist but if i did - if i went in every day and i punched him in the face at 2 am every day i go and punch him in the face at 2 am what is going to happen is he going to get really stressed he might divorce me is he going to get really really stressed no because what is going to happen he is going to say oh i know she is going to come punch me in the face."""" so what you really want to do is you want to give somebody stress but they do not know it is going to happen and it is never ending that is the good stuff laughter so one of the worst things you can do for yourself one of the worst careers you can do - and i am sorry if you do this - is long-term care givers these guys are in a host of trouble you never know if johnny's going to have a good day a bad day you cannot control what is happening this is awful for your health make your aunt do it do not be that guys of so the inability to adjust to stress and this is me i am a high-responder rate and you know who these people are too these are the people who just react to everything right my boss yells at me i freak out my colleague said oh you were late today and i am worried about it everything gives us increased heart rate very easily this is not a good way to live your life laughter the other thing is reactivation to stress and you know who you are and you know who these other people are because they do not leave you alone these are the people who something happens to them my boss yells at me then i go home like oh my god you are not going to believe what my boss did he yelled at me."""" i say the whole thing then i call my ten closest friends and tell them what happened and every time i do this i am reactivating that same ha axis i do not need the tiger to bite me i can make that stuff happen just by thinking about it and the last thing is i guess these would be the psychopaths so a blunted ha activation it is also not good to not respond to stress at all you need a little bit of stress to respond so we do not want our ha axes to get dysregulated. we do not want to die of stress we want to live healthy lives so i know you are really depressed right now laughter so the good news is because the source of stress for us is in our heads we are making it up no one's punching us in the face nobody's starving us we are all living long and healthy lives hopefully all the stress that we have is coming from here it is processing it is psychological it is that kind of stress that we are constantly thinking about so the good news is you will not die from stress maybe if i show you the next few slides you are in control of your stress of so i am going to give you some human displacement activities this is what we do for animals in stress labs when we want them not to succumb to stress and as human animals we can do the same things of the first thing you could do is psychotherapy it is a lot of work but it has been demonstrated that psychotherapy does produce genuine real changes in that neuroplasticity in your brain it just takes a long time to do it but if you do it you can get real changes in your brain exercise believe it or not exercise does a very good job at relieving some of the symptoms of stress you can read an enlightening book these are things that have been clinically demonstrated to relieve the consequences of stress you can have good social support like our nice presenter here leave voucher you could have good sleep hygiene this may include - i study sleep too - this may include taking a nap during the day that is of you can do that or whatever works for you this is my colleague mason german who likes to race cars and that is a great way for him to relieve his stress the other thing that i wanted to talk to you about if those things did not work for you there is a lot of really cool research right now coming out of one particular lab at the university of wisconsin at malison this professor richer davidson and some of the things that he is shown in his lab he is actually gotten the dalasi lama and titan monks to come in and he is looked at their brains and what he is demonstrated is - and these monks they actually show real differences in their legs - so some of the brain waves that we associate with higher processing high mental function seem to be much higher in the monks than they are in controls and some of the brain regions that we associate with love understanding and empathy the insula and the left prefrontal cortex seem to be more activated these monks tend to do compassion meditation but i am guessing this would work for all forms of meditation they even trained regular guys like you and me to do meditation and we can show these changes so this is very cool the hard part is i should tell you that these monks had 10 000 hours of training so it did take a long time but if you are willing to do it you can just be happy like a monk do some meditating if that does not work for you you can always take prozac. laughter better living through chemistry as dry ray said whereas going to therapy takes a long time therapy would be the analogy of going to the gym we all want big muscles we all want to be healthy we all want to look great but if you go to the gym it takes a long time to get big muscles look great and have a great cardiovascular health if i gave you a pill that could do all of those things... come on laughter so this sort of does what psychotherapy does dry ray will tell you if there is consequences to it so the good news is remember i told you when you have all those super high levels of cortisol it kills those hippocampus cells well it turns out - and the dirty secret behind prosaic and dry ray i am sorry is that we have no idea how it works no clue no clue if i give you prosaic your serotonin levels are going to be pretty high right away but when are you going to start to feel better this is what the pharmacologists do not want you to know we do not know how most of this stuff really works it takes a while to feel better but it turns out one of the mechanisms by which it may be working is increasing new neurons in the hippocampus you get increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus so it might be that as cortisol goes up starts to destroy those hippocampus neurons you have fewer hippocampus neurons and you get into the cascade that one researcher calls the glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis when you give somebody prosaic it may increase the amount of neurons and help to restore some of the functioning of the hippocampus so prosaic does increase neurogenesis in the hippocampus and if you block neurogenesis in the hippocampus you also block the behavioral effects of prozac. so that is sort of interesting it is new research so we will see where it goes so i would say the bottom line today is to keep in mind your stress system is fine it is working properly it wants to keep you alive it wants to keep you alive for the next five minutes it does not care if you are going to live to 100. so i would say try to do all of those things recognize that you are in control of how stressed you become and that is all i have for you hopefully you have a new beginning thank you """,jaimetartar,stress and the brain jaimetartar at tedxnsu
"he said it is better to walk alone than to walk with a fool if you want consciously you can evolve in this evening there is no limit as to how a human being can become this is something that every human being must do then coming together will be hugely rewarding when gautama the buddhi was asked is it better to walk alone or in company he said it is better to walk alone than to walk with a fool laughs well that is him not me he was quite sure that only a fool will walk with you laughs so he said it is better to walk alone than to walk with a fool certain lore in this country says when you want to do a short and quick journey walk alone when you want to do a long journey walk in company but the important thing is who is walking with you not always being together is a good thing many times being together can be a nuisance so first and foremost unless you are a twin even then we come alone and we go alone if one does not know how to be by himself or herself then being together can be a lot of nuisance we are referred to as human beings human beings means every other creature is what it is simply because of what it does but a human being can simply be which is a unique quality of the human being that we can simply be that we are not compulsive action that is what it means our action is conscious and judicious but generally when people get together generally people are in compulsive action it can be an association where there could be a purposeful action or it can be a gang where there can be more purposeful action or it can be a crowd which can be a compulsive action so essentially to be human means we have reached that point of evolution within ourselves that if we wish we can simply sit here just be we can consider as to what action to take and what not to take this is definitely individual when individuals come together we say it is we in plural but still it is individuals who have to come together to be an individual means you are not further divisible that means you are just one people find different ways to divide themselves within themselves in india with a 8-10 thousand years of cultural history we have invented various words to divide ourselves it is very common for people to talk in terms of atman paramatta ahankara, this one and that one but every culture has this in their own way when things are going right when good things are being done if you ask people they say eyes i did it when things do not go right when things go wrong then they will try to find somebody if they do not find anybody he is always there laughs when they are very wonderful of course they take pride in being how wonderful they are when they turn nasty they say it was my ego my ego is always a fall guys so individual means that if i am wonderful it is me if i am nasty it is me all of you are you 24 hours wonderful hello are you 24 hours wonderful not not sometimes wonderful sometimes nasty sometimes beautiful sometimes ugly it is okay if we understand it is me who is capable of being absolutely wonderful and it is me who is capable of being absolutely nasty another moment then gradually the number of moments of nastiness will keep on receding if i see what is wonderful is me what is nasty is in india we have many words it is my karma what can i do not you must fix this being an individual is very important that means you are not further divisible if i am wonderful it is me if i am nasty to me if i succeed it is me if i fail it is me you have to fix this i am just asking you a simple question i within this how many people hello how many people within you one two only one if you are one you are normal human being if you are more than one you are either schizophrenic or you are possessed you either need a psychiatrist or a exorcist but you will see whenever things do not go right another guy will pop up from somewhere so becoming an individual means you killed all those popguns and just said this is me this what is me has many dimensions if i do not see this is an individual i cannot divide this further then transformation will not happen if transformation does not happen if people come together in that state there will be more mess than solutions all creatures hang out together whether it is various wild creatures most of them hang out together even monkeys who are just one step behind us they are also in bunches it is only human being who can sit alone and transform himself or herself because this is the prerogative of being human that we can simply be this is why you are called human being you are capable of being you are not in a compulsive state of activity if you want consciously you can evolved in this evening you can evolved if you are willing it does not take a million years because our evolution is not biological anymore our evolution is conscious for every other creature it is fixed nature has fixed two lines within which every other creature lives and goes but once you have come as a human being there is only bottom line there is no top line there is no limit as to how a human being can become so before we associate ourselves with people it will be good every day in the morning or a certain period of your life if one withdraws to spend a little time with oneself and see how in what ways can this be a little better than the way it was yesterday this life how it can be a little better life than what it was yesterday because most people are coming together for their needs to fulfill needs people come together some people come together to fulfill a purpose or a cause some people come together to eat drink and be together because they cannot be alone this is something that every human being must do a certain period of time you do one thing just 24 hours take a break from everything not today right now you are among people you take a break sometimes just 24 hours and do not ready do not watch television do not use a phone simply sit in your room alert not sleeping and if you watch the nature of your mind you yourself will certify this is a madman because for most people their mind cannot stay on any one thing unless they are in activity simply they cannot be here in compulsive state of psychological activity is on when you are like this you cannot be that means you cannot be a human being being has to happen only then togetherness will be very rich if you know how to be by yourself then coming together will be hugely rewarding and of tremendous value that means we came together consciously",sadhguru jaggy vasudev,the power of being alone | sadhguru jaggy

are you bored that is good you could have said not yet there is an investigation among high school students where they were asked to write down in a few words what they think about schools what their experiences of schools were and it turned out that the most popular answer was school is boring and that leads to two questions the first question is why is this so why did i think that school is so boring and in the first part of my talk i will give a diagnosis of the situation and the second question is that should have to be like that and the answer is no and i will in the second part more constructive part i will give some ideas about how to generate motivation this is a picture from a primary school at the end of the with century and as you can see not very much has changed in the general organization of a classroom or the lesson the students sitting at the disks there is a blackboard there is a teacher there are some superficial differences but very much looks the same the organization of schools has actually changed very little over time what you do not see in the picture is there is that there is a set of hidden rules that govern the lecture here and i have written down some of these rules to make them explicit so everybody in the class shall be of roughly the same age they shall do the same thing independently on where they are in their learning development independently of what talents they have they should lose use the same learning tools and in the traditional school the prime tool has been texts textbooks they should follow the same curriculum there is a set program that the teacher wants the students to go through there should be judged in the same way examined in the same way they should all be give the same answer to questions come to think of it this is very funny i mean in school when a question is answered it is supposed that there is unique correct answer to it if you are going out in reality this almost never happens and i should be quiet and sit still unless of course the teacher addresses them and they should concentrate in particular on what the teacher is doing these rules cannot be found in any curricula or any official descriptions that is why i call them hidden they are built into the system and the teachers have to follow them more or less in order to fit into what the school expects out of the teachers if you ask the kids about what they like about the rules they say they do not in particular they do not want to do the same thing as everybody else and why should i is there any reason for this and they do not want to sit still when when my youngest son was starting his first grade i asked him after a couple of weeks what is the main difference between school and and preschool and he answered school makes my bottom hurt and if you ask them about where did i want to concentrate they do not even understand the question and if they do what i want to do they concentrate concentration comes comes automatically there is absolutely no research that supports this rule of these rules of the lessons there is nothing that says that this is the best way of achieving learning they have been established more or less by tradition and they are to some extent motivated by the ideas of industrialism i want to point out two consequences of these rules and the first one is that not everybody the rules have been formulated from the perspective of the schools and there are some some students who have problems here for instance if you have problems with reading texts you have problems in fitting into the traditional lesson here and if you have severe problems you are diagnosed as a dyslexic and you are given special special treatment in the school you sorted out of the ordinary system and in ken robinson's ted talk he gave the example of the girl who absolutely could not sit still and she later became one of brain's most famous dancers and choreographers and she concentrated when she was moving i mean for her sitting still was totally going against her desire on how to behave and how to learn so i recommend school leaders to change the perspective and to focus on the individuals instead you should ask instead of talking about what school says about how you should behave in the class you should ask what how can school adapt to make the situation the best for this particular individual and i think we are very far from from that situation the second consequence and the most important here is that these rules block the motivation of the students now if you go outside schools kids are not bored at all they do what i like to do and young children are most motivated when they are playing and somehow there has been a division between playing and learning playing is for fun learning is something serious so you cannot definitely not learn by by playing this reminds me of the old saying that when you take a medicine it should taste bad otherwise it does not work and the analogy is of course that teaching must be boring otherwise it does not work i found it difficult to see the logic of this argument it is not the teachers fault that school blocks motivation i mean it is these rules are built into the system as a matter of fact the teachers have to work against the rules i mean if you are a good teacher you still succeed in generating motivation in your students if you are not so good you are your you will fail the students will be still be bored and you will lose your own motivation as a teacher so the question is then how should we restructure schools to make students more motivated i wish i had a general answer to this question but i do not but i think i have identified a few factors that are useful in in generating motivation in students so let us turn to these factors i have bored some idea from become burner who is a psychologist and educationalist and he identifies three factors the first one is quite natural that you should build on the curiosity of the students we as human beings are born with a very strong natural current curiosity i think i could say that along with the rats we are the most curious animals on this on this planet so that is criterion is quite natural the second one is maybe a bit surprising he says that having a feeling of having a control over a situation being competent it is a very strong factor for for for motivation i mean if you solve the problem that you that you had struggled with and then suddenly you feel a sense of relief and this is very motivating for you and i will come back to this point that having control it is a very strong source of motivation the third factor is that we are after all social animals we would like to do things together and if we can collaborate among people we like then this also increases cooperation when i read about these three criteria i was thinking about i was trying to find some systems where these criteria or well fulfilled and i found two examples the first example is video games video games built very clearly on the curiosity of the player they build up virtual worlds that are interesting that are fascinating the players want to go around the corner and see what happens in the next scene and so on so these screens are made for for curiosity of course when coming to the second factor a player cannot have full control over the game then it would be boring there is some challenge there is a mission that you have to fulfill and computer games are very often built up in a series of levels the first level is quite easy you can solve it after a few attempts then you feel some kind of service satisfaction you bounce on the go on to the next level and you try again on after a while you succeed and you are building up a sense of how it getting more and more control having more and more competence in this game and even if a game is a one player game they in particular children very often play a game together with somebody else one is playing the game there is somebody else sitting next and looking at what is going on there talk about the game they have an interesting chat about but of course the most motivating games are those where you play together with somebody else in particularly when you play in a team against some other team that is a very motivating situation so the computer game industry has been very successful in catching the motivation of the players and we we see the consequences of of that in the lives of ourselves and of our of our children the second system that fulfills these criteria quite well is what call is called peeler again and if you look at where what children do outside school they are very often engaged in impaired learning they meet their friends they go skateboarding and i go riding horses they play tennis they we play in in the garageband and so on and they are very often driven by an interest in the topic very curious about what they are doing what whatever the topic is and in the group in the peer group there are some who are good and some are not so good and the ones who are the experts in the area they get the very high status in the group then they have a feeling of competence and they are motivated and very often they are willing to help the the children in the group who are not so good to teach them about how to solve a particular problem who to do how to do this trick and or how to play this chord on the guitar oh or whatever is in is going on here so it is very much based on getting more and more control over over an area and more or less by definition peer learning is a cooperative game so peer learning is a system that works very well as a motivating system and i think i can recommend teachers and school leaders to introduce more aspects of peer learning in the schools i think that would be one way of increasing the motivation of of the students and the next factor is understanding when you get an aha experience you get a kind of feeling of relief when you have struggled with a problem we have not have not seen the solution you are stressed and and when you suddenly see the solution you have a feeling of relief and this is very motivating and this motivating thing makes you want to go on and learn more try to understand more so the question is why what is going on here well i think that one factor is that when you understand something you feel that you are able to solve new problems you can see the pattern you can know what to do next and so on and that gives you a feeling of competence that gives you a feeling of control so the mechanism i want to point out here is that understanding generate control and as we saw earlier control is something that is motivating so there is an indirect link here but it is also very important to point out the other direction if you do not understand you become very frustrated and if you are frustrated your motivation goes down very very quickly and therefore in a schooling situation it is very important that the teacher can understand can see whether a student understands what is going on in the classroom or not and help the student to to go on of one more factor is i can borrow from hath john battle's book on visible learning and john pattie he has done a herculean task of investigating in a large number of studies of educational interventions i mean he is gone through more than 800 meta-analysis of a lot of studies and they are actually based on more than 50000 individual studies of educational interventions and in total more than 200 million students are involved in this so it has been really really a big task and what he finds he looks at a large number of factors more than 100 factors of different aspects of school i mean the organization of school with link action of teachers and individual features and so on and one thing he finds is that factors concerning school structure that is how big the classes are very located and so on have indeed a very small effect on the outcomes and he is trying to measure the outcome of each of the factors what he finds is that among the most important factors is the feedback that the teacher gives to the student that turns out to be i mean of course there are factors that the teacher cannot control but among the factors that are with what the teachers can do the feedback to the students is the one that has the greatest effect effect on the education outcomes and let us see how pattie defines feedback this is his definition feedback consists in providing information how and why the student understands and misunderstands and what the directions to money the student must take to improve so again this is connected to helping the students to understand and then we get yet another element in the link here the final factor i want to introduce is metacognition and metacognition concerns how you reflect power upon your own thinking and your own learning i can maybe think that i am good at reading text but i am not so good at using my body and solving problems well i can say that i am good at drawing but i have problems with briefly reading texts or i can think about what have what have i learned in school last week or i can think about why did it teacher present the material in this or that way when i am reflecting upon my my own learning process so to speak and it turns out that introducing this kind of reflection will support learning learning results will be better if you introduce this metacognition in the in the classroom if you give the students information about what all the teaching goals and so on and there and they can reflect on whether they like it or not and so on we do not really know why metacognition supports learning but my diagnosis here is that metacognition is part of generating the control over the situation you feel you know that what way you are going in school and why you are doing something so that is one factor that gives you some kind of control over your learning and thereby you you again generate motivation if i go back to john battle's book he calls it visible learning and he he says that visible learning is teachers see learning through the ice of the students and then the students looking at the teacher and trying to find out what what is what is going on here and i hope you see that this is one kind of metacognition teachers reflecting upon the students learning and vice verse so again i see a connection between the factors that each have to point out and the factors i have identified as a model here so this is my final diagram where i present all the links that lead to motivation and as you can see there are many roads to motivation thank you very much,peter grdenfors,tedxnorrkoping - peter grdenfors - how to motivate students
"it is not true what they say that you cannot love anyone until you love yourself have you heard that people say you have to learn to love yourself before you can love anybody else but it is not true i loved everybody before i loved myself love does not care which way you come or what state you are in when you get here love welcomes everyone unconditionally oddly so do focus group moderators - laughter which is how and why i learned to do it if you have never been a part of a focus group you are missing a really special cultural experience so in every focus group there is a range of characters right there is always a shy one and a chatty one a grumpy one that does not want to do any of the exercises and a very excited mom with a notebook who wants to get an a plus in all of the exercises laughter there is a student who lied on the intake because they need the money and a dad full of jokes who cannot read the room laughter and usually there is one ex-military guy who keeps staring at the two-way mirror suspiciously laughter it is a situation where a group of people that may not otherwise ever meet have the chance to share their perspectives and it is my job as the moderator to make sure that they all get heard now it is not quite a classroom it is not group therapy and while the community feel has some elements of holiness probably no one would call it a spiritual experience i mean no one else because moderating rooms of strange and difficult voices is what taught me to welcome all the strange and difficult parts of myself no kidding i start every morning meditation with the same opener i use as a focus group moderator thanks everyone for being here laughter your input is valued laughter him going to hear from each of you ill give you all the chance to speak just do your best to be completely present honest and try to make any requests reasonable so i do not know about you but there are a lot of me in here in the mind of are faith ism not referring to psychiatric illness specifically but i do not exclude that laughter my mind has plenty of quirks but what i have to share is for anyone with an inner dialogue though i admit it is especially for those of us with a really noisy one so i noticed some time ago that i was arguing with myself and then i wondered if i did not agree with me who is i and who is me in that scenario and it turned out that there are quite a few of me there is a really sentimental emotional me an intellectual analytical me those two argue a lot there is a me who loves being on stage there is another one who is pretty shaky at the moment some of us - at this time i include you - some of us regard these as feelings or thoughts and maybe we have done our personal homework accepting that we can have conflicting feelings at the same time we can be excited about a new job and also dread going back to work we can be tired and want to stay up we can adore someone who also annoys us we can love someone who has badly betrayed us we know this and when were honest and rational we can see that these are common experiences but were not crazy to both love and hate camping laughter it does me no harm to embrace that i feel both ways about it but what about the thought that ism worthless that i do not belong here the mistakes have made are unforgivable that the bad things that happened in my life were my fault those thoughts are just as real as the rest of them but they are harder to live with and they send many of us to therapy or to yoga or the nearest bar which more or less describes my daily commute for many years laughter because i wanted to silence those thoughts completely and let me tell you i tried i have done every kind of therapy i have ever heard of i have done talk therapy energy healing body work hypnotherapy soul retrieval the tapping stuff the thing with the lights i did seven kinds of yoga i drank the special team with the shaman in the forest laughter i admit i did pass on the acupuncture they do with live honeybees - laughter people do that laughter suffice to say i tried and still sometimes when i was alone i would hear myself shouting shut up or worse to my own mind in my work as a people researchers it is my job to practice empathy with strangers to receive everything i can about their world in order to understand them as deeply as possible now it is noteworthy that i found this career at a temp job writing meeting notes when my supervisor noticed that i was not just paraphrasing conversation i was recording body language micro-expressions, tonal shifts specific verb choices what neither of us knew then is that the qualities which made me seem skillful were the symptoms of complex post-traumatic stress the most reasonable results of an appalling upbringing and a fact i share not to set me apart from you but to welcome you in here with me everyone in this room has walked through something difficult in order to be here and i want you to know that whatever path you have taken to get through it is honorable whether you never talk about it or you write bad poetry about it whether you make tons of money prosecuting it or if you just hit the gym like a champ to sweat it out of your body there is truly no wrong way there are some ways that cause other problems you know the ones laughter have done some of those i still do some of those and i do not judge those either because gifts and curses are buy one get one and mine were no exception my early life gave me heaps of shame and a splintered sense of self - hence all the different mes - but it also gave me super antennas for the emotions of others this hypervigilance made me a certified mess of a person but a damn near-wizard-level observer so i got to work the last 20 years have shadowed people in their homes at their jobs while they shop and drive and go on dates i ask them to be honest and vulnerable with me and to do this i practice something that i call unconditional welcome which is like a researchers neutrality but a little extra the day i discovered it i was sitting in the living room of a research subject she was a very unpleasant woman if ism honest feeding french fries to an infant as she snapped at me that she would never have her children vaccinated not even to protect them from polio because she did not know it was in those shots now never mind that she said this an inch of ash deep into a virgin slim right laughter i was judging her i know ism not proud of it but at least one of me is a jerk laughter i needed to connect with her and i did not want to i did not like her i did not respect her i did not want to spend a single moment with her and the project required that i spend hours and that i used that time to get to know her what she values what she believes where she finds strength researcher neutrality was unavailable to me at the time so i had to get out the big guns i called up my new age visualization skills and i took a deep breath secondhand smoke and all and i imagined that my breath was inflating a shiny soap bubble filled with unconditional welcome not tolerance not even compassion total welcome as is - no comments no notes and as i inflated the bubble it became big enough to contain my whole body and then hers and in that moment i saw a mother feeding her baby in a world that she did not trust i told her that i could see that she cared about protecting her son and i asked her if she got that from her parents and then we had a conversation and i learned about her i learned why she was afraid and angry and how she fought through that fear to make a family when i welcomed this woman unconditionally i saw her more clearly but i also loved her instantly we have been told too often that love is hard it is not love is what happens when we stop trying to figure out who deserves it it is right there when we stop trying to figure out who deserves it and we welcome someone anyone exactly as they are in the moment it will be two more years before i learn to do this with all the parts of myself but it started just as simply a part of me had become very chatty - a part that was afraid and angry whiny demanding unreasonable and relentless she told me that we were never going to get better she wanted out of here i asked her what i could do she only told me she wanted to die over and over and over and over i begged her to shut up and she did not finally after weeks of harassment whether out of exhaustion or epiphany instead of shouting back i took a deep breath i became my own moderator i said out loud in a voice that surprised me thank you for sharing ism going to remind you of our agreement to be honest and reasonable and she answered me - that voice now do not get spooked this is all just thinking happening laughter but the part of me asking and the part answering did in fact seem like different parts she told me that she was in a lot of pain and i told her i know and i promise you ism going to take care of you but i need you to get on board i will listen to you but i will not obey you and as clearly as ism speaking to you now she said okay and then we started to talk as i continue the dialogue with myself i found more of me more voices with more points of view some of them more fun than others and the imagined landscape of my mind began to look a lot like a focus group this round table of wildly mixed characters and one moderator keeping some kind of order with honesty boundaries kindness and most importantly gratitude i thank my selves for their contributions no matter how bonkers or twisted they may seems because were all me i think of my fragmented self less like broken mirror and more like a prism were full spectrum today there is not a voice in my head that i do not welcome and while some of us are occasionally unreasonable were not mean even my whiny shame voice is trying to help in her weird way but when i ask her to be clear and kind she tells me exactly what i need to know what she needs to feel better and what she would like for me to learn but just like the scared and angry mother she only does this when i accept her exactly as she is in the moment so while my openings for self-talk and focus groups sound almost identical the closings are a little different at the round table i would hand out parking validation remind everyone to sign for their cash but when ism with all of me i say i love you thank you for helping me see what you see - which is why this practice is so useful for all of us here with our different perspectives inside and outside of one another if we can receive one another with the curiosity and welcome of a focus group moderator perhaps we can do a better job of love because it is not true what they say that you cannot love anyone until you love yourself love is a house you can crawl in through a window if you cannot start with yourself start with the person next to you right now whether you know them or not all you have to do is let them be here it is easy is not it wherever they have been whatever they are carrying whatever talents they have or do not have whatever mistakes they have made can you just welcome them here can you welcome you were here right now like this were beautiful and strange and complicated and scared and sometimes kind of horrible but all of us are worthy of welcome and everyone that you show unconditional welcome may show you a part of yourself to love you are welcome thank you",are faith,how to talk to the worst parts of yourself | are faith | tedxkc
"this elephant has incredible strength she can uproot a tree with her trunk alone yet she will remain in captivity held by only a light rope despite her ability to easily break away she does not even try why it starts when she is young she is first tied down when she is small and not yet strong enough to break the rope she will try at first try as hard as she can to break free and try and try but eventually realize she cannot suddenly something attached itself to her that is stronger than any rope or chain or fence it is the belief that she cannot break free it is this belief that holds her back - despite her ability i have had these same beliefs - you may have too - beliefs that held me back beliefs that led me to feel unfulfilled in my work to struggle in my relationships and to live a life that was far from the one i am living now it was only when i became aware of my ropes and actively pulled against them that i found myself in a different reality how do you break the ropes that tie you down do not believe everything you think when i was six years old i had a favorite baby sitter amber one morning my mother told me we could not have her babysit because she did not have enough money to pay her so that afternoon i started my first company i gathered rocks from around the neighborhood painted them with my art set and went door to door selling them to our neighbors that night it was amber and i on the couch together when i was young i was bold outgoing and fearless i wore what i wanted laughter or did not want to wear laughter guided by my own voice that told me what would make me happy i was also in love his name was forzando and he was wonderful as with everything else i was not afraid to grab him with both hands laughter as i grew older this picture started to fade my exuberance was replaced with timidness my leadership with conformity my boldness with fear i do not think any of us leave childhood without some ropes despite our parents best intentions i grew up with a mother who was determined to give me the perfect life armed with love and good intentions she did everything for me to help me be perfect i would pack a suitcase to go on a school trip and she would unpack it and repack it in a more perfect way i would be ready to turn in a school art project and then she would add her own brush strokes to make it better later she told me when my choice of boyfriend or apartment was not good enough although she just wanted what was best for me i stopped knowing what was best for me an unconscious rope was formed i should not trust my own voice and my own ability and i feared not being perfect other ropes attached themselves too i grew up in a family filled with yelling loud voices and strong opinions to keep the peace i learned to stay quiet to not rock the boat to become invisible in school i came to believe it is more important to blend in than stand out and the pain of an early heartbreak led me to hold back in my relationships so i could avoid getting hurt i am not good enough do not speak up do not stand out fear failure these were my ropes this is not just my story like the elephant we all come to believe certain things in childhood that were not true - or at least are no longer true but we still live with them as if they are if you have ever felt not good enough alone unwanted unloved invisible powerless like you do not belong - these are your ropes if you have ever felt you cannot trust yourself trust others speak up stand out ask for help let others in be accepted as you are - these are your ropes these ropes hold us back i found myself defaulting to others opinions when i should have been trusting my own staying quiet when it would have benefited me to speak up and blending in when i would have been happier if i had to courage to stand out this led me into a series of jobs that ranged from tolerable to miserable in one i hoped i would get sick so i could stay home from work it led me into a series of relationships in which i lacked confidence in myself the other person and the relationship these never worked out my beliefs affected the way i perceived the world which changed how i acted which led to a self-fulfilling prophecy i felt small and my world became smaller what we believe has powerful effects decades of social psychology research backs this up in a study performed at dartmouth college an ugly scar was placed on participants faces with makeup they were then sent into a room for a conversation and asked to report how people responded to them with this ugly scare but here is the twist right before they left the experimenter said hold on a minutes we just want to touch up your scar a bit."""" rather than touch it up they removed it entirely so unbeknownst to them the participants went into their conversations looking completely normal despite this they came back and reported how awkward their conversations were how people avoided looking at their scar had trouble making eye contact and were tense and uncomfortable in the conversation their beliefs about their scar led them to see things that were not really there and to make meaning of innocent behavior what could have been a perfectly normal conversation instead became an awkward one their beliefs created their reality other studies show the same effect highlight an avian woman's avian identity before a math test she will perform better highlight her female identity she will perform worse lead a group of men to believe an athletic task is diagnostic of sports intelligence white men perform better lead them to believe it would diagnostic of natural athletic ability black men do give someone a white coat and tell them it is a doctor's lab coat they will perform better on an attention task than when told it is a painter's coat in all of these cases same people same abilities same tasks - different beliefs and in each case it was their belief that raised or lowered their performance how you see yourself and your circumstances will affect what you see how you act and what occurs as a results it is almost as if our beliefs place a virtual reality headset on us laughter a headset that allows us to see things that are not really there and sends us into a false reality we have these headsets even when they are miles from the truth i remember hearing the top model cameroon mussels share how models despite having the shiniest hair and the longest legs are some of the most physically insecure people on the planet and award-winning author idea yuknavitch shared how she did not follow up on the literary representation she was offered early in her career the reason in her words we do not always know how to hope or say yes or choose the big thing even when it is right in front of us it is the shame we carry the shame of not believing we deserve it."""" our headsets have us living into a false reality they also cause us to bump into each other once i would been dating someone for a few weeks we will call him bend we talked every day then he went on a work trip for four days silence i did not hear a word how would you interpret this what is the first thought that pops in your head my beliefs led me to wonder what i had done or said to make this once enthusiastic person change his mind about me i shared his silence with friends one who admits she has trouble trusting people was sure he was on this trip with another woman laughter another who admits she is afraid of rejection guessed he was probably upset because i had not invited him as my date to an upcoming wedding and a third who has trouble with commitment guessed he probably thought we were moving too fast and was taking some space each person saw the same situation through the lens of their own headset who was right how should i respond each of these assumptions leads to a different response moving too fast - i should pull back but if he is feeling rejected this would just hurt him more feeling rejected - i should up my calls and invite him to the wedding but if he thinks we are moving too fast this will just push him away further i was so confused as i was ping-ponging around in my own headset while briefly borrowing some of my friends headsets this relationship died a slow death are you ready for what was going on in bends headset he would been deeply hurt by a past relationship was afraid of getting hurt again and pulled away when his insecurities got the best of him it was none of the things anyone had guessed sometimes our headsets get in the way of our relationships it took me a long time to learn this just as our beliefs can hold us back they can also propel us forward let us go back to the scar study for a moment imagine the opposite imagine the researchers place something on the participants faces that leads them to believe they look beautiful and then remove it before they go into the social setting now what do you think they believe about others responses how do you think they show up differently what difference does it make if you believe you are ugly or gorgeous good at math or terrible at it good at sports or not it seems a big one i finally learned this lesson my headset led me to law school there my long-held false beliefs were reinforced aim for perfection follow the crowd fear failure this was a familiar path then one day without thinking much about it i signed up for a class outside the law school called design thinking boot camp a class that promised to unleash my creative potential i had to design innovative products and experiences or more accurately pull on almost every single one of my ropes i had to trust my own voice because when it comes to innovation there is by definition no one to look to for the answers i had to put myself out there because innovation does not come from playing it safe and perhaps most importantly i had to be willing to fail to be willing to not be perfect the best designs came only after multiple failed attempts if i wanted to get it right i first had to be willing to get it wrong i struggled in this class because all of the things that would help me succeed were the same things i believed for so many years i should not do i finally gave in to their crazy approach and the most amazing thing happened i was free to go play try things experiment - to live as i had before my ropes i felt free in a way i had not since i was six years old and i accomplished things i never would have imagined possible i was astounded proud liberated - and confused i wondered if the beliefs that held me back in this class were the same ones holding me back in other parts of my life the seed had been planted maybe i should not believe everything i think headset off to take it off i just had to realize i had it on ropes broken new beliefs lead to new actions in my first bold move since i was six i turned down my offer to work at a law firm and placed myself in a different reality i experimented with different jobs and took on various side projects saying yes to ones i previously would have said no to due to lack of experience trusting i could figure it out i was still afraid of failure and taking wrong turns and sometimes i did i just no longer let this stop me then one day i took on a 10-week partitive position coaching speakers i fell in love with this work we are talking fernando-level love laughter no longer afraid to grab things with both hands i went on to start my own company helping leaders become more powerful speakers and to teach a communication class at stanford. particularly meaningful for me is that i now get to give others what i would lost for so long - a more powerful voice i broke other ropes too when i was self-conscious and shy i never could have imagined revealing my insecurities to you on a ted stage laughter that would have sounded more like a bad dream yet somehow here i am this process did not happen overnight each new thought each new action built on the one before it until i found myself in a new reality i still have ropes i am working to break my goal is fewer over time to get there i remind myself of the marshmallow challenge teams of four are given 20 sticks of spaghetti a yard of string a yard of tape and a marshmallow the winning team is the one that can build the tallest freestanding tower they can in 18 minutes the marshmallow has to be on top this challenge has been given all over the world to business-school students lawyers coos cots engineers who do you think are among the top performers recent graduates of kindergarten laughter here's why the other groups will take what they think they know what they think is the single right answer and end up executing in the wrong direction in contrast kindergarteners stay open to multiple possibilities they test out different options they gather information by experimenting until they find the best way forward they have fun what makes us so amazing as children is we live in a world before ropes in a world before what is known when there is what is possible."""" in a world before i cannot when there is how could i?"""" in a world before falling and staying down when we fall and get right back up again - undeterred in a world in which nothing is holding us back from our full capacity what the design class was for me i hope this talk is for you - a seed that gets you to question what you have previously accepted as true that makes you more aware of your ropes that helps you see they were always yours to break no matter who you are or where you are in this moment there is the life that you can be living if you break your ropes you get there one new thought at a time one new action at a time until one day you find yourself in a new reality thank you """,laurel weinstein,do not believe everything you think | laurel weinstein | tedxpaloalto
"as i have been recently hearing about disturbing sad news i often think about the idea of loving yourself we have been taught to love other people as an important value but i think loving our own selves has not been considered to be an issue worth talking about why it may be because it is too obvious that we love ourselves to take up the issue and stress the importance all of us cannot avoid being egoistic sometimes we want to have things our own way if everything in our life is going well can we love ourselves not necessarily so the reason why it is hard to discuss 'self-love' may be that it has a kind of a narcissistic whiff and sounds a little icky to people if we saw somebody looking in the mirror saying how i love myself do not bother me!'... i am not talking about myself we would want to say suit yourself keep looking in the mirror i want to say it does not have to be like that to love ourselves life is not always easy it would be of course nice if we were happy all our life but in our life many people might say i hate you or i wish you would disappear from this world going through the agony we ultimately reach the realization that we have to love ourselves in the sense of taking responsibility for ourselves and looking after ourselves if when people tell us i hate you we respond to it by saying eyes i hate myself too the moment we said so i am sure we would lose our desire to go on living i have felt the need for that kind of attitude more than once myself since we do not know what will happen in the future the kind of situation in which we have to love ourselves might arise again in the sense of needing to take care of ourselves it would be wonderful if you could live a trouble-free life for a quite long time i could not figure out what kind of person i was when i did something good for others people showed appreciation to me and then i thought i was basically a pretty good person like that i had occasions that made me feel relieved on the other hands when i would really hurt someone i was very disappointed in myself feeling like i was fundamentally a cruel person to love ourselves actually may be harder than to love any other person because we know ourselves thoroughly through and through looking back at all we have done in the past and remembering boy i did such things as this and that...' and not only the good things we have done but unpleasant things we have done also come back at us can we love ourselves with knowing all those sides of us at this point i thought in our thought process there must be something fundamentally wrong then i started by doing this to change it first i honestly looked back at myself seeing a pretty good person or one not so good and for the time being i accepted all my 'selves,' good or bad instead of being judgmental about myself thinking i may be a nice guy at heart or i may be basically a cruel person which one is really me i decided to accept all my selves as parts of myself and thought about why i had so many varied selves in this one person to sum it up it is in response to different people and different situations when i talk to my grandmother i am very relaxed when i talk to people at work i may sound serious putting on a serious look talking about difficult things when i talk to somebody who rubs me the wrong way you can bet the tone of my voice cannot be this calm i try not to come into contact with such a person in the first place in any case each self of mine has its own uniqueness to love each self of mine equally in order to love myself may be very difficult but i can say i love my self when i am with this person i become somebody whom i even abhor when i am with that person but i like my self pretty well when i am with this particular person i am not too bad in fact to love ourselves may not be that hard after all take romance suppose there are two girls and i have feelings toward both of them one day i have a date with one of them and have dinner with her i enjoy being with her talking a lot frequently interjecting jokes smiling at each other and we interact with each other very well then suddenly i notice it is the time for the last train i rush to the train station to catch the last one and at home i am happy with myself as for the other girl i also like her but during our date i cannot talk or joke that much... and we often get awkward silences i feel like a miserable loser i do not feel like going on with her so after having dinner we say goodbye to each other after the two dates if i were asked which one i would rather see again i would choose the first one without hesitation there is no doubt i like her but rather because i like my self when i am with her i enjoy my self when i am with her and find life worth living in the life of that self of mine the definition of love may be to love somebody else this surely is not wrong but what i would like to add to it is rather to love means with the help of the person we love for us to be able to love ourselves that is what i would like to think i can reveal my inner self as i wish without any difficulties being true to myself when i am with that person and it will never happen with anybody else unfortunately some of our relationships come to end some end out of disputes others end due to death when we grieve over losing our loved ones we miss the voice and hug of the person and many other things but i wonder if we may rather be grieving over losing the life of our self who lived with that person thinking only with them could i talk freely like that only with them could i be honest with myself only with them could i be silly like that but that person is gone now and i cannot live the life of that self of mine i love any longer i wonder if that is what we really grieve over and of course vice versus if somebody says to me i love you i will be euphoric yelling 'yes!' but if i were told thanks to you i come to love myself or i love myself when i am with you more than when i am with anybody else that would be something which strikes my heart more that my existence validates one person's existence that way moves me with a deep joy something poignant each time when we find one self we love we may be finding our foothold we need to go on living in our life we feel like we need to be loved by many people a certain percentage of people in our groups in our class our workplace but not that many of those selves we love may be necessary if we find two or three of our selves we love in ourselves we can go on with those as our foothold five or six may be more than enough you may think you only have 3 friends in your class at school or you may think three that many friends who help you like yourself all depends on how you take it to love ourselves does not mean saying i am crazy about myself looking into a mirror but instead it means with the help of or via somebody else for us to come to love ourselves it is probably where we start really loving ourselves and that is why as we feel the need we love others as indispensable individuals that is all i want to say thank you",keiichiro piano,love others to love yourself
i have a problem how many times do we say that and we tend to think that it is because we have problems that we struggle in life it is not true if we struggle in life it is because we have parts within ourselves parts who are suffering parts who are afraid and most importantly who believe nothing can be changed this is the reason why we struggle up until a few months ago i thought i had a problem which was that i found it hard to speak about me in public on a personal level but i did oka because as a doctor most often it was related to medical or scientific topics and as a results there was no discomfort until the day i received a call from someone who means a great deal to me and who invited me to talk about my experience on the use of the psychotherapy model which i am introducing to you tonight and that i use at my hospital but he did ask specifically for me to make it personal since it was my experience and i quickly declined his invitation because there was a little voice inside my head telling me you have nothing of interest to say well i thought i was at peace with that but then few weeks or months later that same person calls me up again and again asks for me to present at that time i thought there most certainly was something to unravel here because if this person who means a lot to me asks again for me to come and talk about my experience there is something unfinished about this at first i asked him to give me a little time told him that i needed to think it through and i used this time to look inwards to look inwards to know who was telling me that i had nothing interesting to say to other people on a personal level to do so it is important to take a moment here is how i did it i focused inwards on this voice calmly and in a curious manner who is it at first all i heard was this message you have nothing of interest to say and then as i kept asking i heard something else if this person really knew you he would not ask you to do that he really has no idea who you are you have nothing interesting to say it went on for a while after a while i realized that this voice came from a person a part of me and that this person had all the traits of a critics a judge from within this was an important discovery because i could really become aware of the presence of this person and as a results i could genuinely talk with him ask him questions such as why do you keep on telling me all this why do you have this purpose in my life to criticize me to judge me the way you do what are you afraid of if i did accept the invitation and went to the conference to talk about myself it was really interesting because all of a sudden the tone changed and instead of criticism came something quite moving deep inside i am afraid that you may relive something hard you have experienced before so first i thanked this part for his caring intention and i then asked it know would you agree to step aside and to let me reconnect with this hardship you want to prevent me from reliving he agreed to that and behind this part of me was another part a little boy eight years of age he was standing by the door of the apartment i used to live in at the time he was standing absolutely frozen and he did not know i was there because for all these years the critic was standing between the two of us and so it took a little time for this little boy to realize that i was there and that i was there for him and so we started talking open heatedly i asked him if he would want to tell me about himself his story why he was frozen we took a moment and talked about his suffering his emotions once he turned to me and recognized me and trusted me enough he started explaining to me telling me things things i already knew but he said them again from deep inside his heart told me that he was the youngest of a family who was going through a hard time then with many agencies to deal with and that whenever this little boy wanted to talk about himself there was no room no time for that as a consequences he ended up thinking that what he thought was important to say in his heart was of no interest since nobody cared or so it seemed to him this was an important time because from this moment on he felt completely understood and so i asked him now that he knew i understood him whether he would leave the past behind and be interested to join me in the present whether he was interested in changing his way of life clearly he was and so i told him for this to happen there is something important for you to do it is to get rid of everything linked to this hardship and that still weighs on you he agreed to do so to relieve himself of his burden and to my great surprise i met a bold adventurous little boy very eager to join me and go to this conference once this change had taken place i turned to the critic and asked so how are things for you now do you still need to play this role in my life and once again to my surprise he said no i do not need to anymore i see that you can take care of this boy he is safe now i then asked would you accept to play another part to do something else less difficult less burdening he said woke i will be your adviser now i will assist you so the little boy the adviser and myself got to work we prepared the conference and people quite liked it why did i choose to tell you this story here tonight after all it is a story pertaining to familiar elements being hurt being defensive and maybe one would frown upon such a happy ending still there are key points i want to share with you linked to my own experience both with this little boy but also with the therapy model i came here to tell you about first the importance to meet the parts within ourselves how important this relationship is second why is it stuck inside as a result of what and that not dealing with it will prevent any change thirdly it can change there is a plan be what i did when i looked within was that i connected with it i could have talked to somebody about my problem i even could have mentioned my parts to them but instead i went within myself francs within franchise and connected with these parts first the critics then the boy and this is essential because when a connection is created from within myself changes occur a feeling of security and trust emerges and this allows for an important thing to happen which is for this critic to show himself beyond what he tells me who he truly is his underlying positive intention towards me he wanted to protect me it allows him to take a risk the second thing was why was it all stuck inside why was the boy stuck in the apartment the answer is quite simple it is because of his burden what is his burden it is the suffering which is attached to the hardship and this suffering is still there it was in or on the little boy the little boy was stuck there thinking he was not interesting the problem with the burden and the parts of us bearing it is that these parts absorb it all these parts believe they are the burden itself they forgot that they are merely bearing it they believe they are it and as a results this burden becomes a poison a genuine poison bums in our societies we like them so long as they are far enough from us they are dirty they stink they drink they yell they are unclean and so we tend to stay away from these members of society the same thing happens within ourselves there are parts of ourselves who are not attractive who stink who have experienced such hardships that have come to be unworthy of love because they are not pretty inside and so within ourselves we do the same thing we do with bums we shield ourselves from them and isolate them inside how do we do that well it is quite simple actually there are other parts in us who are quite good at this and create a protective barrier they are called protectors so who are the protectors well they are these parts in us which are linked to our habits our reassuring ways of dealing with things for example taking a little pill before going to bed because it is a little too hard without it or to have a couple of glasses because there is a difficult meeting ahead and we want to be relaxed or this overwhelming urge to succeed in life or to rely on your intellect to understand everything or to do sports because one has to release one's energy somehow and calm one's anxiety all these behaviors which are a little bit over the top which make us feel like we do not really have a choice in the matter these are the protectors within us there are parts within us doing all this and fortunately so because they help us cope with our pain they help prevent us from feeling down and when we feel down because we are in contact with these wounded parts they help us getting away from them because it is just too painful to stay there the problem is that these parts are scared because they know that if they stop what they are doing the fire of pain will rise again in our lives and so this fear prevents them from stopping why well since the wounded parts are convinced that they are their own burden that they are dirty the protective parts have no choice but to protect them and behave in our lives sometimes to extremes even to the point of being destructive either for us or for others this is the first tragedy the second tragedy is that we end up thinking the same thing they do that change is not an option that we are stuck with this forever and that is why it is important to know that there is a plan be plan b is the plan you use whenever what you tried first did not succeed plan a is i am hurt i protect myself plan b is something else it is doing what i did it is going within myself francs within franchise meeting these parts it is important because first it allows for the understanding of the intention the history the pain but mostly it brings security it allows for my protectors your protectors to stand aside enough so that i in a loving way can access these wounded parts and when these parts feel the compassion and love they agree to do what my little boy did which is to release their burden and to come back to their real nature and from then on our protective parts can consider stopping what they do what they are exhausted doing and causes us problems in life this person this francs within francs who could do all this is like a flame inside it is who i really am deep inside of me in the ifs psychotherapy model i am introducing to you tonight the internal family systems model this flame is called the self and i would like to leave you with a message that we share the adviser the little boy and myself this message is that this self is always here no matter what happened to us even the worst situations even in the most chronic situations this flame is always here available as an invitation to our protectors to trust and an invitation to these suffering parts to relieve themselves from their pain an invitation to our parts to relieve themselves from what weighs on them and come back to their true nature thank you,françois we doze,on croft upon a does problèmes... - tedxvaugirardroad
"good afternoon everyone oh wait a minutes ism a hometown girl so when i say good afternoon i need some hello. good afternoon everyone that is a little bit better that is some hello for you my name is glens remind and i am here to talk to you as poetry as healer before i do that i want to say that there are three lives to poetry that is what is been said it is first when you read it second when you write it and the third it is when you speak it to life when i was investigating that i thought that is wonderful and it is so true and i teach that all across the country but what i realized is that they are missing one thing i one when you read it two when you listen to it three when you write it four when you speak it to life poetry has been a healing medium in my life i know because in 1993 here in greenville, south caroling i was diagnosed with a chronic illness fibromyalgia. some of you are familiar with it some of you might not be it is a muscle disorder a pain disorder which has a host of other symptoms i the i not good for a poet i carpal tunnel not good for a poet a host of digestive issues and food allergies not good for anybody my doctor came up and said to me glenis, have got some good news and some bad news good news is you are not gonna to die from this the bad news you are gonna sure wish you would have when i heard these words i was working here in greensville, south caroling in the early nineties and i thought well that is like getting pretty much close to a death sentence and i remember at the time i was married i was a clinical counselor and my twin daughters amber and celeste were twins and i could barely hold myself together to do work take care of them and i remember one moment in particular that i was laying on my couch wondering what am i going to do with my life and i was watching the i was watching past i was watching i bill movers who is my guru i and he had a show called the language of life it was a poetry festival the dodge poetry festival and i will never forget this moment it was as if the universe was talking directly to me through a poet that stepped up on the podium and said these words will not you celebrate with me what i have shaped into a kind of life born in baboon nonwhite and woman what could i see to be but myself i made it up here on this bridge between stashing and clay my one hand holding tight my other hands will not you come celebrate with me that everyday something has tried to kill me and has failed those were the words of lucidly chiffon that acted like a lightning rode got me up literally and metaphorically up off my couch and i began to pursue poetry at the same time i was doing a little book called the artist way by dulia cameroon that book lit a fire in me i started working with the south caroling arts commission the poem that i want to do for you now is i want to talk to you about the healing impact of poetry there is numbers out there ism not a numerologist when it comes to poetry i just know that poetry scooped this hand in and healed me but now doctors therapists understand the healing impact of poetry it slows the heart beat down i want to do this poem as a signature poem of mine and i want you to just kind of get in touch with your feelings what does this poem do for you this poem is dedicated to my mama who happens to be out there in the audience her name is pianette redone without her i would not be the woman i am today this poem is called mama's magic it goes like this my mama is magic always was always will be there is one phrase that constantly bubbled from the lips of her five children my mama can do it we thought my mama knew everything believed she did as if she were born full blown from the encyclopedia britannica. i could tell you stories of how she transformed a rundown paint peeled shack into a home how she heated us with tin tub baths from a kettle on the stove poured it over in there like an elixir my mama is protection like those quilts her mama used to make she tucked us in with cut out history all around us we found we could walk anywhere in this world and not feel alone my mama never whispered the shame of poverty in our ears she taught us to dance to our own shadows pay no attention to those grand parties on the other side of the tracks make your own music she would say as she walked and cleaned the sagging boards of that place you will get there you will get there her broom seemed to say with every wisp we were my mama's favorite recipe she whipped up us with her two big brown hands in a big brown bowl supported by her big brown arms we were homemade children stitched together with homemade love we did not get everything we ever wanted but we lacked for nothing we looked at the stars in my mama's eyes and they told us we owned the world we walked like kings and queens even on midnight trips to the outhouse we were under her spell my mama did not study at no hazard or male but the things she knew you could not learn in no book like... how to make your life sing like sweet potato pie sweetness out of an open window how to make anybody anybody feel at home how at just the right moment be silent and with those eyes say everything's gonna be alright child everything is gonna be alright how she tended to our sickness how she raised our spirits how she kept flowers living on our dilapidated porch in the midst of family chaos my mama raised children like it was her business in life put us on her hip and kept on moving keeping that house pine-sol clean yeah my mama is magic always was always will be her magic how to stay steady and sure in this fast paced world now when people see me with my head held high and my back erect and look at me with that i who does she think she is i keep on walking with the assurance inside ism black magic and ism pianette redmonds child as time went on i was booked by a national booking agency the load artists i started working for the kenned center in washington dick as a teaching artist and i just returned from new brunswick new jersey where i am the poet in residence for a month at the state theater they send me out into the community and have seen the healing impact that it has had on people in prison and homes halfway houses and schools senior citizens and this next poem that ism going to end with is a poem that was inspired by middlemen county academy in new brunswick where i was working with gang members and also a group from i we were working with addictions this poem is called bruised, i wrote for them they banter back and forth like boys do you charcoal son you so black you purple i tell them holdup in defense of my mahogany skin and the boy they are putting down you know what they say in cue as if we rehearsed it we both chimes the darker the berry the sweeter the juice we flash twin smiles there is a moment when the air gets less complicated in the room the space is large enough for me to ask why you all hate on each other so hard oh he he my boy see that is how we show love ism so tired of everybody being gangsta hard i want to weep they are keeping it real though cause i got three brothers and growing up i never saw them show love except in that man on man dunk-in-yo-face, call-you-ignant-ten-times-a-day way their talk swags like their walk the conversation dips and drags and we end up talking about how we were punished as kids and i lead with him from the south all and all do not know nothing about no switch i having to go around back fetch your own hickory the same one used to beat you i say these words and i can still feel the sting of the switch see the welts raising to an angry language of graffiti on my skin another one says and do not bring back no skinny one neither i nod my head in solidarity i the blood we spill makes us kind another boy says what about those belts and i can hear my mama's beating cadence i i told i you i not i to i did not i i another says extension cord ism brought fully awake cause i do not know nothing about that kind of beating we only heard of ceric down the street getting beat like that then we did not know the phrase child protective services we did not know the word abuse we just said his mama was mean jicante, another one says huh? you kneel on your knees on raw rice for hours we go down dark alleys they go deeper into the shadows further than i have ever been but we do not skip a beat we laugh we joke about our beatings nobody nobody nobody mentions the pain because it is all understood we are all battered we bump up against each others wounds before we brainstorm i pick up the marker they bicker blue versus red i read between the gang signs it is not lost on me when these colors mingle they make purple i muse in my mind how violence for them still continues but we come back to these poems the poems we are here to write the ones that had saved my life but these detours down old roads is a place we had to got places we have been loved so hard it hurts so hard we are still bruised we bear our scars and then we pick up our pens and write i want to thank you i have seen people's lives change have seen them pull up and rearrange their lives their perspective all through poetry and my idea that were spreading if you do not have poetry in your life get you some thank you",glens remind,poetry as healer
"since the source is strong and the city light is intense they said that i had come back from a trip and now ism leaving again it has to do with what ism going to talk about now which is the need to communicate i was eager to share with you what ism going to discuss now i felt i needed to do it if i had not it would have been left hanging when i was about to miss my flight to come here i felt like a black hole was forming in my week wondering what i would do if i did not see you and although we did not know each other yet i knew i wanted to share what i had with you to share the emotions and lessons learned from a real experience if you notice the second conference without knowing exactly its name ended up saying that the greatest human need is communication but then there was a man who came along to disrupt everything in 1977, avid wilkins, who wrote a book called the book of lists in this book he told us that the greatest fear of humans is public speaking the problem is that this was replicated by book writers specialists and psychologists ignoring the root cause we have been told countless times that the greatest fear of humans is public speaking we see an interview about a new course on public speaking and someone comes along and says eyes this is very important because we know that the greatest fear of humans is public speaking the same thing happens when were reading magazines that offer small tips saying that the greatest fear of humans is public speaking connecting this with the first conference this is a clear example of how when we are told that something is scientific or there is a study backing it we automatically believe it this test was done with 3,000 people but we do not know what kind of people they were they were asked to list their fears including heights insects spiders flying and it turned out that the most common of all was public speaking but we still do not know who these people were that the test was conducted on if they were university students as is often the case with america studies it is easy to understand what happened all feared making a presentation however ordinary people might not even consider this fear or consider it at all if public speaking is the greatest fear for most people i wonder if we saw our audience as zombies like in an episode of the walking dead or a romeo movie how should we approach it moreover my question is this books tell us that when you fear public speaking you should imagine the audience naked i tried this at first and then stopped as it made me more nervous others say not to worry because when the lights are so bright you cannot see anything that is a lie if someone is giving you a bad look or making a gesture you notice it but when we are here it feels like when an animal is alone with no escape routes there are three people who will not let me out there are no exits and ism surrounded by zombies this is how they want us to see it justifying our fear when we go to school it is normal that a kid does not want to speak in public because it is supposedly the greatest fear of humans this has been repeated since 1987, and we have come to believe it because it is a scientific study so can we really do something to face it ill ask a question now among the people here who fears more dying by fire or speaking in public ism sorry for avid because andorra are an exception to this statistics their greatest fear is dying by fire it is like the asteroid village where everyone wants to watch football the point is there are greater fears so why are we deceived into thinking that the greatest fear is public speaking jefferson, gorge washington, bone from up elves presley, and even maria had the same fear of public speaking this makes me feel much better it is a fear i share with great figures it is a fear but it is less than what i was told and when you have to train a group of people with severe psychotic profiles you certainly feel like you are on the edge as if you could fall into an abyss despite having experience with various complex groups and difficult situations working with psychotic profiles is especially challenging for one reason when we think of this we think of someone flying over the cuckoo's nest or what was once called madness and that scares us it is because we are deeply ignorant we do not understand the reality of these groups who live in our society and need a place in it we look away ignoring them like when i was a child and thought there was a monster in my room and hid under the blanket hoping not to see it people with special needs exist in our society and show us how important and powerful the need to communicate is there were people in the room with their heads down arms crossed and moving seeming unreachable experts said that these people could not speak in public but there is always light at the end of the tunnel these people whom we try not to see because we would have to react if we did wanted to share things with us they wanted to share their dreams and passions one person was a fan of world war i another was a fan of the band heroes deal silencing and a girl loved cooking even if she was not very good at it this was the light at the end of the tunnel they had something to share something to offer so instead of listening to critics and specialists who say let us not put this person in these circumstances because they cannot do it let us recover the essence that brought me here everyone has something to share and they want to share it with as many people as possible this same drive is what leads us to tweet and post on facebook; we want to share what we feel this is the light at the end of the tunnel of course when these people had the chance to speak they stopped thinking about their fear of public speaking they stopped thinking that their fear was justified by books or specialists and started thinking only about the people in front of them when you think about the person in front of you you forget about the fear the exhaustion and the sleeplessness you forget about the fear of public speaking",ago de maria,la necessitate de comunicar-se
"hello i am happy to be with you again to have returned to the mountain what does it take to be a writer can you live off writing what advice could you give us these are questions people always ask me when i visit schools or libraries young people like you and although... the truth is i do not have an answer that fits everyone i read between the lines of these questions that there are people in your family or friends with very good intentions who are probably telling you oh so you want to be a writer you are going to make movies or be an artist you are going to starve guitarist writer... maybe as a teacher in other words double starving because we know that in our society being a teacher does not have much prestige either i cannot give you the answer you are expecting those who want to live off storytelling despite the fact that i pay bills with stories and despite the fact that in a much broader sense i make a living with words think of scheherazade. sometimes i feel like i make a living with the column i write but i also get a lot of ear pulls and i cannot say anything different from what worked for me i just tell young people in those meetings that reading was very helpful to me and that answer of course makes teachers happy they all say you see reading i say of course reading because since i was a child i liked books and that nourished my thinking my structures and even to tell a story one needs to have read a lot and up to that point everyone is happy especially the teachers but then i add another answer which is to play a lot and they look at me like i am an alien they say how come play a lot and i say well pretend finally that is what 2-year-old children do you say let us pretend you are the dad and ism the mom and were going out and that here was the field and over here there was a horse and we would ride it and we would go on a boat that is what we do when we create stories that is what we invent creating conventions saying let us pretend you were juliana, and i was valerian and that this happened and that this movie started here the only difference with the game of children is that it requires hard work much more than 99% perspiration and i inspiration so that the seams do not show and that is serious work for those who want to get into this however... however this idea of fantasy... people say oh how beautiful fantasy is you work... of course half the time ism working with children ages i i i 5 in a workshop that asks about the connections between literature and art and early childhood development and they still say how beautiful imagination is oh such lovely children how beautiful imagination is well in a way yes but imagination and that is what i want to talk about today underlies all human inventions think about this madness were in today where someone in too can see us while were talking here it might have seemed like science fiction to my grandparents however there is nothing more real to us than the internet the world and all its inventions seem to participate in that fantastic breath of building possible worlds that is the same as my i i 4-year-old children have when they play let us pretend a skyscrapers a suspension bridge over the sea a song a symphony if you look at it it is based on that same scheme of something visible and something invisible let us pretend that these symbols these alphabets these digits meant something else and let us start working with symbols and that is the world and yet education... look at the basic skills curricula and ask them look up a word processor and ask the primary and secondary curricula how many imagine there are how many ""repeat"", how many create there are how many ""identify"", well let us not even mention ""dream""... no curriculum shows it have searched with a magnifying glass how many ""play,"" how many create possible worlds how many ""do,"" how many ask something how many ""answer,"" how many ""explore,"" repeat what others said and look at television programs we have to be like others we risk our lives to be like shakira, instead of building voices how many build voices are there in the curricular how many venture hypotheses and how many get lost in the middle of a process in the middle of uncertainty that applies equally to sciences and arts and what have seen is that these little ones i work with who have taught me so much over the years have very porous and wild boundaries for them researching and imagining are close verbs this makes questions too i do not know if you remember your childhood but why why why did dinosaurs become extinct hey why do not airplanes fall from the sky why do people die childhood is an existentially difficult and terrible age and art at that time of life is profoundly salvific. so how to think how to think of a pedagogy that rescues the breadth of curiosity for example the joy of discovery an artistic pedagogy that goes beyond coloring within the lines at a time when lines are being erased for all of us how to think of a system and an educational world that prepares these little ones... for what do we know what it will prepare them for i look at these i 3-year-old children and i ask what of what they are learning today will serve them to inhabit their reality what possible worlds will they visit if they tell me that space travel is a given if we all know that books as we knew them are on the way to extinction what will books be like what will curricula be for these children what of what they are learning today will serve them to inhabit their reality i know you have asked yourselves that same question the same one we asked ourselves what of what we were taught in school will be useful for life will be useful for the future well that question at this moment is so undeniable and there is such a large gap between those children and you that i fear they will look at you as if you were their great-grandparents. a child of one year right now or a child being born is as separated from yousorry to say you are old's i am from my great-grandmother. there are so many inventions and such vast horizons... where will they live in this orbit or the other so when one works in education and with art that idea that literature is something so beautiful and that imagination is so lovely because children are so imaginative starts to become not just something lovely and yes it is lovely but a vital and cognitive power a basic alphabet for exploring possible worlds what can i give to children what can literature give to these little ones what can literature give to you what can the experience of art give to you the possibility of adding to all learning processes that fantastic breath that imagination gives us the crazy one in the house i do not know how knowledge is framed in a world so close to science fiction yes we are leaving imagination the horizon of questions behind what would i say about what needs to be done and what you are doing and that is why i love being here moving between questions moving from one question to another and what we should be forming in you is not the ability to answer but the ability to ask more questions to go from one to another and another because that is the world you will face it is a difficult world many enigmas are already emerging there are many hard difficult things there are moral dilemmas you will have to resolve that will be in your hands and in the hands of the children i work with for example when to end life for example which genetic elements to leave in the embryo and which to manipulate for example whether life on this planet will be sustainable for example if in these global protocols we will continue to say nonsense or take commitments for example the terrifying inequality of this planet that is already being talked about that young people like you all over the world are talking about are filling plazas and that is where the crazy one in the house in literature starts to speak the language of particularity you will need to have imaginative empathy to weigh the human consequences of your decisions someone will have to do it and art literature and philosophy will be essential because they will give people amid... i say people people amid the avalanche the noise the media dine the twitter feed the news about the world and other possible worlds... literature and art will give them news from the depths of themselves and i believe that young people will need imagination so that their ships can take off and reach very distant places but they will also need it to know who they are to explore the depths of themselves to undertake those old tasks of knowing yourself and knowing others to put yourself in the shoes of others who feel think... to gather the accumulated experience of humanity because that is what literature is if you look odysseuss journeys madame ovary's weariness hamlets to be or not to be love poems elegies what are they if not yellow butterflies cortázar, casa tomada,"" what are they if not voices that account for the passage of others through the world that gather the accumulated experience of so many people from particularity not from theory but from the deepest hearts and you will need to have those insights to account for those insights that go beyond generic terms like humanity women children human rights what do art cinema and literature speak of they speak of the one by one of the depths of human beings that language inhabited by real particular subjects that language for those who want and ask what is needed to be a writer what advice could be given the only thing i could say is that you will not starve that in this increasingly technological but also increasingly imaginative world there will be a need for people who tell stories because if you think about it each of us is a story agree with youwhat is our life if not an attempt to piece together a narrative of our own to give coherence to the random disconnected events of life and create meaning from that imagination the crazy one in the house what you have here today is a product of someone's imagination a dream that grew and grew and then someone dreamed that dream and gave it voice i wish you never stop asking questions that you continue to wander in questions that you torment yourselves and get entangled in the uncertainty and the questions that is all thank you very much",poland eyes,explorer la fantasia para habitat la realized
i will talk about two things first of all about our view of creativity what we think it is and secondly about changing changing your mind and actually even more about changing your mindset i am a typical example of this because if someone had asked me 10 years ago would you like to give a talk in english no not really would you like to do it for exactly 18 minutes no i will not would you like to do it in front of an audience with very high expectations and important people definitely not would you like to be recorded live and people could view you afterwards and laugh and say that was not correct english grammar no definitely not so that is why i am here today you understand i think you will understand after this 18 minutes that i have done some traveling in that sense okay but first ken robins he talks about being educated out of creativity and i think that if you put his thinking into some kind of diagram it would look something like this you have knowledge increasing by h it should but you have creativity decreasing by h and i put two or three questions here at the beginning you ask why you want to know things you want to understand and you ask why not because you question what you take for granted but then after a while and the schooling takes on and you start asking what is the right answer and i think it is not only for schools i think it continues into work life also but we want to have the right to answer so what could you do well i did a thing a couple of weeks ago i went to this event organized by a company or an organization who wanted to introduce creativity and entrepreneurship in schools i think it is good and it started very well they talked about a website and you could have a different kind of projects for schools but then at the end they have this they wanted to share things up so they wanted to have a creativity competition well that is good so we were divided into random groups that is good also and we were presented with this task be creative and make an airplane which flies as long as possible you understand the task right and we were given this good because we were given constraints that is good for creativity to have some things to work with so they gave us colored papers and tape scotch tape and paper clips i think there was some straws you know straws where you drink soda with and all of the people started doing things like this you recognize it of course because you have done them as a child and and we lined up for this competition all the teams and people were throwing them with quite bad result obviously but after a while comes a person who seem productive and throws it and it is an obvious winner is not he no it is not i hear this man behind me saying if that is okay i am not participating that is not that that was against the rules that is not okay and the people leaving this the people from this creative organization wanting schools to be more creative they said sorry that is disqualified that is not an airplane because it has no wings and i thought this was really educating after creativity why should we be so constrained to think that that was a bad solution well i think it is because we want creativity to be nice and beautiful and colored and a bit like art and people had also names on the sides as if it would make them fly better but this ugly one you know the ball of paper which is some way i can sign it off towards if you want to it was not accepted and i think it is a big problem we have there so i think we need to upgrade our view of creativity and you could do it best at emblem stadium we have all these people here ordinary people like you and me sitting all here and we have this space around here where you have all the advertising and and so on and we have the field and we are all watching the field and we are all watching the creative players hunt with who wants the stars the ones who knows all about creativity now i have a fine line up here on all sort i am stein prison if you ask people you want two examples of creative people you will get this answers because they are quite obvious creative people right they are talents they are even born talents they are eccentric geniuses they are inventors in arts and music and i guess they are all male and they are all dead now and we have the team leader of the mold you know who this is who is it a vinic fantastic i thought you would say spider-man because it allows the picture is not it but course in this context you have you recognize the man in the circle and i think we need to get away from this this kind of of icons of creativity and try to look it at it in in another way so let us look at the next level i call this i have stolen this from damn pink one point two point three point zero eight it is all about copying and and twisting a little bit so i take the responsibility for that and let us look at the next part it is about the business and business has really realized that creativity is important and there is a big survey last year of ism which pointed out creativity as the number one asset for the future and it is something to listen to and we have all these creative companies right but the problem for me i am not thinking that i am leopard a vinic and i am not thinking i am not working at one of those companies but i think we need to have creativity all over not only in these places and where you have all this atmosphere so i wanted to see something else so i thought about this more like creativity being more a general attitude and a mindset and i call it really creativity three points area and i will introduce you to a man who is he is not exactly leopard a vinic and i do not think that he has ever worked on googly but he is a nice fellow with a problem he has he has a car which is slightly too big to fit into the garage this this he will be talking in in not in english not in swish but i think you will understand the context anyway you jane brain art is safe nontoxic safe the auto and encouragement only in the kubinashi fond tree is the obvious problem you see this limit the negativity and mother asking doubt is naming very elastic yeah - tamasha centimeter see and dormant in the mujahidin taken a critical mistake and the truth about the criteria moose mu taking the moose lodge nicotine and the markets cruelly gonna be ready behind your head my hair has to show fear from flare zone this letter look ready to talk to the millimeter and now we start and saying equals the auto industry getting a look outside at chronicle and now i am gonna get my dear if i might not open do what i am just gonna get here stephanie well and see doc can bleach em out auto castellan it stop and devour variety even that they did one they not so to

milkman cinnamon ear and the meeting may feel worthless ooh lathy drag it now to stand de mantra blanch berry the roman who called it a gland or to go in roman and pretend i am kidding bit is it movie of so what is he all about well i think he is very creative but his it is a fantastic man he has it it takes on a challenge right he does not give up he takes on the challenge he challenges his own thinking about what is possible he also puts in a lot of effort in doing this you could see that here also carved in the wood dope in the door opening he had carved the wood to make the door possible to open and he probably had a few mistakes resilience is about dealing with mistakes they probably had a few ones on his way i could think that his neighbors would look a bit funny when he was doing all this but at the end he shows something else he to me he shows another mindset a growth mindset where you try to expand yourself and to develop and and become a creative person so let us look at some other examples this is about a person who was chairing kitchen together with other students and every time she came to the kitchen it was full and other people were were cooking food so she thought about another solution not giving up not saying of i will go to mcdonald's or whatever she looked at the coffee brewer and started making food in a coffee brewer making boiling pasta and so on and even made a blog which was an experiment in cooking but you could do all these things you could you could see the fish in here it is not so tasty but anyways and it was it was voted the food blog of the year it says more about swish food culture maybe that that is something else and she put everything in there not not the cat i think because if you if you i think you should run it through the mixer first before before i put it in the coffee brewer and she looked at another place what can you do to fry a steak and now a hair straightener and it is all you know with this frying forceps that is a new way of thinking is not it i do not know it is probably one of those do not try this at home things but you get a steak with with a taste of shampoo and another way of looking at things if you want to start a hotel you can you have all these four and five stars hotel around you you could look another way you could start with a zero star hotel they have a fantastic slogan the only star is you and they put beds in the basement and you could sleep there 400 swish crowns or sheep fare and they had is gathering every night where you got this lottery ticket and they had they pull the winner and the winner had the advantage of going upstairs and taking a shower the only one who could take the shower this is now a museum and it is spreading a little bit and another one is you all look very fit so you go to the gym do not you you go to the gym yes and you have all drink water yes okay and when you drink water you want to fill the bottle right yes but it is not that easy in the water basin always because you have to have this angle where you have to have the tap here and some of the water is not coming into the bottle you recognize this problem and you get it filled to scientifically 69% every time because you cannot feel it done and this was something which leopard a vinic did not do anything about and not to create two companies but the 15 year old girl she put another opening here and solves the problem that is a new way of thinking solving things so i am gonna go a little bit further into those three ones about challenge and effort and resilience and talk about the mindset and there is a psychologist at standard university named carol deck and she discovered by examining motivation for 25-30 years that were some driving forces behind how you think as she invented this theory or mindset it is very simple but it is very effective and i have been thinking a lot about it what is the mindset it is your beliefs about certain things it is your beliefs about being creative do you think it is something that you are born with or if it is something that you developed you could think the same about leadership if you are a leader in a company or in school do you think it is something that you had from the beginning all these abilities or do you think something that you can develop over years deliberate practice and you can think the same about the entrepreneurship and musicianship and so on and so it all comes down to a question what you believe if you are a born talent or if you think that the brain has so much plasticity changing so that you can can develop a lot by that and she talks about the fixed mindset and the growth mindset and the fixed mindset is if you think that everything is carved in stone set in stone you have a certain amount of abilities and that is it that is the fixed mindset the growth mindset says that you have a starting point with your talents but it is a starting point and you cannot really predict the potential you can reach very very high potential if you continue instead of thinking that it is just something you have or have not and this has some consequences because if you look at those three ones which i think are some of the driving forces behind creativity and also behind learning it has some interesting results because if if you are faced with a challenge the fixed mindset would say no i will not take on that challenge because if i fail i have been proven that i did not have enough so why should i try i want to look smart so i will not try if i am not sure of completing the task easily the growth mindset on the other hand thinks well if you have if you want to learn you have to stretch yourself and you have to go out to the practice zone and go into the learning zone instead so learning is the only way to take to to get by by being challenged by doing something harder and to to work with it so it is a different way how you look upon a challenge if you have a fixed mindset you look upon effort at something you should not have to do because if you are good you should do it anyway you should do it from the beginning you are a good person you are good football player you do not have to train that lot but if you look from the growth mindset view you will say that well the only way the brain is not biologically but more like a metaphor it is a muscle to make it better you have to train and the only way is by effort that is how you get better and thirdly about resilience the ability to bounce back when you have had mistakes setbacks and obstacles so if you have a fixed mindset you would say that i am a personal failure because i have gotten the proof that i do not have enough so it is a mistake i am bad i do not have it but on the other hand if you look at the growth mindset it would say all right this was a mistake i have to do something else maybe change strategy or change how much i worked with it so it is it is a different mindset and i have done the traveling from being somewhere here which would have made me say no never do this to going over there and say all right i will do it i will survive and i will probably learn something of it this is about equally divided among people when you do this investigation i cannot go into all the results but but you could transfer but half of the people are fixed mindsets thinking but you could change then you should change and you could change by by knowing the mechanisms like this and it is also important to feedback if you work with other people and also how you are given feedback if you are giving feedback like you are a perfect person you are fantastic it is a general feedback but you should be working on the feedback on challenge feedback on the effort and feedback on resilience then you will reach much better potential regarding creativity and learning thank you for listening,boss lesson,a growth mindset for a creative mind
"how exciting to be here what i am going to try and do today is add to the amazing lineup of speakers today by bringing the brain into our discussion of the creative spark and i want to do that by telling you about some of the newest research that i have been doing in my neuroscience research lab at new york university asking the question can aerobic exercise that is can going to the gym actually improve your learning memory and cognition i also want to address the question of whether increased aerobic exercise can also make you more creative now i remember the day that i realized i wanted to become a neuroscientist i was a freshman at up berkeley, and i was taking a freshman seminar class with just 10 or 15 of us called the brain and its potential taught by martian diamond she was standing at the front of the classroom and she had this beautiful hat box and with her gloved hands she opened that hat box and out she pulled a real live fixed human brain now it was the very first time i would seen a human brain and what she told us was that what she was holding in her hands was the most complex structure known to mankind it is the only structure that can think about itself and one of the most amazing things about the brain is that it can change as a function of the environment it can learn it can grow and i thought that was the coolest thing i would ever heard in my whole life and i did not know it that day but that idea of the brain and its potential and what is called neural plasticity - the ability to change as a function of the environment - was going to become my life's work in science that is what i want to tell you about today so i started out studying a structure in the brain called the hippocampus it is really important for long-term memory but more recently i have become interested in how exercise can actually improve our learning memory and cognition and i got interested in that not because i read a paper or went to a talk i went to the gym when i turned 40, i decided i wanted to get in the best shape of my life and i went to the gym and the class that i found that kept me coming back to the gym on a really regular basis was a class called ""intensati,"" developed by this amazing fitness instructor named patrician more in new york city now intensity is unique because it takes physical movements from kickbox, dance yoga and martial arts but the unique part is that it pairs each physical movement with a positive spoken affirmation what do i mean by that so in intensati, we do not just punch we say i am strong now and the class says it back to you so what happens is that you not only get that great aerobic exercise but because you are speaking out you actually get an increase in aerobic output and it makes you feel great so the bottom line was i got in great shape but there were two amazing benefits that i noticed one was that i had this amazing motivation i felt like a million bucks after i came out of this class and i could not wait to go back and i thought my gosh patrician more is an amazing teacher to instill that kind of motivation and then i thought well wait a second i am a teacher i wonder if my students feel that way after my neuroanatomy class i am going to come back to that in a second the second amazing benefit was that when i went back to work - when i started doing intensity i was writing a lot of grants - and i noticed that as i got more regular with the workouts my writing got easier i was able to make associations better i was able to focus better and i thought this is amazing i want to look at the neuroscience literature to understand what is going on and i looked at the literature - a lot of new studies coming out as well as looking at some of the older studies that had led to our current understanding and when i looked at those i found a very familiar name that name was martian diamond so she was not only my undergraduate advisor but she was a real pioneer in neuroscience research and really only one of the only women working in this field back in the late 1950s and '60s, when she discovered that when you raise rats in what she called an enriched environment with lots of toys to play with other rats to play with and they run around a lot and you compared their brains to rats raised in what she called an impoverished environment with no toys just a couple of rats in a small box what you can do is measure their brain you measure actually the thickness of that outer covering of their brain called the cortex and what she found is that the rats raised in enriched environments had cortices that were actually thicker their brain grew as a function of this enriched environment and later studies showed that exercise the increased exercise those rats were getting because they were running around a lot more was a big factor in that brain change so i thought okay this is an area that i really want to get to know and as a professor the best way to get to know topic area is to teach a class so i decided i am going to teach a class at nu called can exercise change your brain and i decided because i got inspired to do this because of exercise i thought would not it be great if i could bring exercise into the classroom and not only teach students about what exercise is doing to their brain but also teach them have them experience what exercise felt like so i thought i could do this so i decided to go to the gym and of course i loved intensati, so i became a certified intensity instructor and a certified fitness instructor i could tell you oh it was so hard i was teaching classes i was writing grants but the truth is it was so much fun it was really fun because i got to learn a whole new way to move a whole new way to motivate students and i stayed in great shape so there was nothing better so i had this class i was teaching i was going to teach an hour of aerobic exercise i trained for six months to be able to teach in front of this class - i had never done this before but i thought it would be fun - so teach an hour of aerobic exercise an hour of intensati, followed by an hour-and-a-half lecture on the effects of exercise in the brain but then i realized i had my first study right there my students could be my subjects in my first study all i had to do was test them cognitively at the beginning at the end of the semester and compare their performance to a class that did not exercise and ask whether in fact exercise could improve their cognitive performance so that is exactly what i did and before i tell you what our prediction was and what our results were i just want to take you back for a moment to september i 2009, which was the first day of this can exercise change your brain class and it is seared in my memory mainly because i was really scared and nervous i give many many lectures i love giving lectures but this one i was very nervous why because my goal was to actually try and inspire these kids to love exercise in the way that patrician more inspired me but also inspire them to love neurobiology and the brain and plasticity the way that martian diamond inspired me so i had a pretty high bar and i was pretty scared to step out in front of that classroom but i have to say i think the students were a bit scared too they would never come to a class where the instructor came in workout clothes they would never sweated in front of their professor and i got a lot of nervous laughter when i told them they were going to have to say positive affirmations not not say yell positive affirmations in class but i have to say it was the most memorable first class i have ever taught the students really got into it okay there was nervous laughter and a lot of giggling but they really got into it they were shouting the affirmations they were really going all out in the workout and the best thing was that motivation and that inspiration oozed over into our academic our lecture part they remained engaged asked lots of questions it was a fantastic first class and a fantastic semester so what did we find so our prediction goes back to that structure that i said was important for long-term memory the hippocampus it goes back to the hippocampus because the hippocampus is one of only two brain structures where new brain cells new neurons are born so you and i have shiny new hippocampus cells being born in our hippocampus but the cool thing is that experimental studies in animals have shown that increased aerobic exercise can actually enhance the birth of those new hippocampus neurons and make them live even longer so our prediction was that this increase in aerobic exercise in my nu students would actually improve their learning and memory improve their ability to learn new pieces of information and improve their ability to retain those new pieces of information did we find that well we tested them on a whole battery of different cognitive tests and what we found was one significant improvement in my class that improvement was in the ability to encode new long-term memories what task was that it was a complicated task it was actually a quite difficult task students were given a really complex geometrical image - it was like an etch-a-sketch image - and then after a delay they would have to discriminate between that etch-a-sketch image and one that looked very very similar to it my students got significantly faster at identifying the correct image that they saw before so they are able to separate out things that are coming in your memory for example you are meeting lots of new people here today and so you might be better if you exercise and come to my class at differentiating between the faces of different people that you meet today so that is a very very useful thing to be able to do so is this new what is new about this well it is new and exciting because - i have to say we are not the only people my lab is not the only lab interested in the effects of exercise but the majority of the work has been done on looking at the effects of exercise in the elderly population why because cognitive decline is a major health issue in the elderly not to even mention alzheimer's disease the exciting news in the elderly population is that increased aerobic exercise has clearly been shown to improve cognition so that is great but the idea there is that there is decline already so you have a little bit of room to see improvement what about my healthy young very smart nu neuroscience majors they are at the peak of their cognitive abilities as are you and i could exercise actually help us our studies suggest that yes they can now we are not only interested in learning memory and cognition but there is a really exciting link to the topic of today's conference that is creativity and that comes from one of the newest directions of study of the hippocampus we have known for a very very long time that exercise can improve - sorry - that the hippocampus is important for long-term memory but recent studies have suggested the hippocampus is also important for creativity and imagination why because patients with hippocampus damage have significant impairments at being able to imagine new situations so we ask a patient with hippocampus damage describe for me a tropical beach scene - they have never been to a tropical beach they can barely say anything about sand or water whereas a control subject would be able to tell you about the white sand and the corona in their left hand with that an umbrella in it all these different details so the idea is the hippocampus is not only important for putting new associations in mind that help you remember the events like this in your past - it will be in your past - but also important for putting new concepts together in unique ways the basis of both creativity and imagination so what we want to do - we have not done this - is to look at the effects of exercise not only on learning and memory but on increased creativity as well so what is the bottom line here the bottom line is simple increased aerobic exercise can improve learning memory and possibly creativity what is more to know and everybody wants a magic pill to get smarter well this is not a pills and it comes with a lot more sweat than a pills but it can help you it is free it helps you every day and our goal over the next ten years is trying to figure out exactly how that is helping you what exactly is changing in the brain so i only have one question for you who wants to go to the gym anybody okay great thank you",windy suzuki,exercise and the brain
late one night in 1944 in german-occupied amsterdam three armed men burst into the apartment of this an apartment belonging it is this woman maria dearies she lived there with her seven-year-old daughter and a young jewfish woman named tell who had been hiding there with her for the previous year the intruders were dutch naris who had been tipped off by a neighbor and as they hauled tell away ultimately to the camps their leader put a gun to maria's head and demanded to know the names of her contacts in the dutch underground you have ten seconds he told her ten nine eight now maria was in fact a member of the dutch underground and she had no illusions as to this man's intentions she had seen far too much cruelty for that seven six five four maria was a woman of great faith and she prayed and as she prayed a great clarity came to her she began to think lucidly about her situation she realized that if she told these men what they wanted to know they had no reason to keep her alive at least for now all they had were suspicions three-two-one well i do not know anything maria said i do not know what you are talking about i just took pity on a poor girl for a moment it seemed certain that the man would pull the trigger but abruptly he lowered his gun spit some invectives and with his companions walked out those hellish ten seconds in the life of maria there were a classic countdown and what i want to argue to you today is that we as a society although we may live in the most countdown rich era in human history need to get a lot smarter about countdowns and to do that to deal with the sort of problems we have been describing today we need to start learning from people like maria dearies this is your dictionary moment the word countdown did not actually appear in the english language until 1952 and then it referred specifically to the backward counting that now centum ate later made famous but over time and popular usage it came to refer to any marked counting of our progress toward a particular moment in time as in the countdown to war the countdown to summer the first countdown many of us encounter is this one at the hands of our parents and if you think by the way that this is a that is not fair it is a count up instead of a countdown think about it three is launch time this poor kid is totally doomed and and and what we know is that countdowns start happening in our head every time we start marking progress to a particular future time or event near as i can tell based on my research there are three ways we use countdowns in only three ways we use countdowns we use them to build tension as the dutch name did and as mom was doing we used them to control our anger you know take a breath and count to ten or count back from three and we use them to structure our response to deadlines that are approaching and measure our progress towards them now we tend to think that we are putting on in modern society and there were the only ones who have ever suffered deadline pressure but think about nah now nah was not given a deadline curiously to build the ark but to fill it with all the known species of the earth he had seven days and if you do not think he was counting down those days i do not know what you are thinking but today we have gotten exquisitely good at this whole process of counting down we count down everything we have countdowns to tell us how long it will take us to cross the street we have countdowns to tell us how long it will be before we get to talk to a live person we have countdowns to tell us how long till the next presidential election some people think this is good some bad we have we have countdowns to tell us how long how many shopping days left before christian and by the way this is a real count and for those of you who are expecting gifts from me i need you to know this we we pretend to be put upon by these deadlines and we are we feel the pressure of them but we also love them they are an absolute staple of to and film and books and entertainment of all types including the most emergent type digital games every almost every digit game has some element of a countdown in it this is a very one of the top most popular phone apes now now think about that we actually load countdowns onto devices that we carry with us and willingly submit ourselves to so we arrive at this moment in human history where we are playing an ever-increasing game of beat the clock perpetually counting down the time on everything between where we are now and what we might want or need or fear or must do in the future and that makes a whole lot of sense when you are living in a complicated society because what science has shown us is that we are really bad at three things when it comes to complexity our minds cannot fix complex tasks in time our minds are also really lousy at dealing with an overabundance of choice we are actually unhappy and become paralyzed in that situation and we are really bad at breaking difficult tasks into manageable chunks countdowns help us do all of those things overcoming those natural deficits but here here's a question i have for you because there is a problem here if that is why we are seeing such an explosion of countdowns why are we so lousy at the ones that really matter in terms of dealing with complexity be it what seemed like a pretty simple one on the debt crisis or dealing with some of the more complex tasks that we have been hearing about today like climate change like endemic poverty like world hunger like dealing with our dependence on foreign oil why are we so bad at even setting countdowns on those things i think one of the reasons is that we are training ourselves to view countdowns as this we are training ourselves to believe that if we miss one there is always be another one and besides we can go out and celebrate by the way i endorsed this countdown i think it is a great one and we will do it later but i believe that if we are gonna get serious about dealing with the issues we have been talking about in this room we need to adopt a philosophy of countdowns that takes us back more to this model the model of maria de geese or this is the late carnage melon professor randy paunch many of you in this room even worked with him many of us knew him and what was extraordinary about this man is he was given one of the worst countdowns imaginable and what he did with it transformed his ordeal into an international lesson that we all can admire maria and randy faced decidedly different countdowns but here's what they had in common they had five elements in common and based on what i have been able to determine these are the five elements of all truly consequential countdowns in our lives first of all they are imposed on us we do not choose them we do not load them on our phone they are being imposed on us by a by someone or something that is counting down time for us the stakes in them are extraordinarily high their life or death or feel like it they seem to offer us only really bad choices choices between bad and bad there is some level of uncertainty about them some level of agency on our part will affect them even if just at the margins and finally fifth there is a finality to them no matter what happens at the end of the countdown the world is never going to be the same when we get to the end of that countdown and having studied a lot of people like randy and maria what i can tell you is that they respond in five brilliant ways and these five brilliant ways are ones that we should all consider because consequential countdowns are a part of all of our lives even when we are not paying attention to them you all have them or you know people who do people who are counting down the time to an end of a life an end of a marriage an end of a relationship an end of a job an end of something dear to them and the first response that is that that you see in people like randy and maria is fierce acceptance now this is different from just passively accepting what is happening to you this is acknowledging that there is no reset button and that the only thing you should focus on in this moment is the countdown that is determining everything about your life in that time and what that allows them to do through that process of fierce acceptance is exercise fierce defiance sure the choices in these consequential countdowns are lousy but what then they step up to deliver is an idea that maybe they do not have to accept the deal as offered maybe they can come up with their own choices in the process what is remarkable too is that they they exercise in that moment an amazing ability to think clearly they tap into not pan not emotion not checking out but reason they think through what is happening to them and at the same time as they are thinking it through they are tapping into a deeper sense of purpose it may be religious faith it may be a sense of legacy for the world it may be just a commitment to country or nation or global population but there is a deeper sense of purpose that you see emerge in these people and finally through that process of putting those pieces together they demonstrate a capacity to transform the countdown's so that they end up being about something completely different than they started in they started being a choice between death and betrayal and they end up being a profile in courage they start being about how to die they end up being about how to live it is an extraordinary lesson what if in the discussions we had about problems like we were talking about today things like climate change we were actually setting treating these countdowns as consequential what if we started acknowledging that the countdowns are happening every day in our lives and being measured in roads not taken dreams lost or not realized time not spent with loved ones or at a societal level countdowns being measured in the melting of glaciers lives of soldiers being lost needlessly minds being wasted in schools that do not function what if we started acknowledging that those countdowns are real and started making choices on the fierce commitment to making better ones at the end of those countdowns one of my favorite quotes from randy paunch came not from his last lecture the famous one but from his last last lecture one on time management that he gave and he quoted dinner employees and he said you know what they always say when asked when the park will close the park is open until 8:00 and i love that because what people like randy paunch a maria dearies do in facing consequential countdowns is they transform the closed into the open they close they transform the negative into the positive they transformed the and into a new beginning this is a picture of me standing in front of maria there is apartment i made a pilgrimage there with my son a few years ago because you see maria is was my grandmother and and her little girl grew up to become my mom and young woman tell actually survived the war and came back years later to thank my grandmother for what she would done and what what my grandmother taught me are teaches me now across the void of time is that acknowledging consequential countdowns is important there are countdowns that are consequential but it is how we react to them that makes them truly consequential i love this quote from many liver and i wonder how we might react if we realized if we if we if we rephrase this wonderful poem of hers tell me what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life and added tell me what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious world because in the end there is only one countdown that truly matters and that is shaped by the answer to the question that my grandmother's example poses and that is that the truly important countdown is the one that runs from one two done thank you you,grant elephant,10 seconds
morning uh people often say that i got a strange ability with my mouth and i guess the reason can be traced back to seven years ago when i first time become so obsessed with human noise making so during the pursuit of this crazy passion i began to realize the astonishing variety and the unlimited potential of human voice so i decided to spend the time and really to take the journey to explore how much we can actually do with our human voices so along the journey i have to say it is very exciting and joyful adventure and today if i may i would love to demonstrate what i found and share the joys with you to start off random noise pick drum high head snare electronic beats well thank you and then let us let us um take a back to the old times the michael jacks thank you so much thank you so if you have not figured out my name is coward ma and i am a beatboxer which means all the sounds that you just heard heard 100% vocal and they are all from human voice so it is 7 years ago at the age of 11 that i start um to actually see gearbox at the summer camp and is where my my instructor made a sound like water so i found it really fascinating so i came up there and asked him how did you come up with that noise well he told me a very important lesson is any sort of art or music is from your real life so just pay attention to the details of your real life to what you do every day you will find the music the art the joy and the inspiration so i take his words and begin to look for something interesting in my life and try to express them throughout my human voices for example the car race in the video games it is out of gas let us try it again ready there game over thank you so for another example the helicopter in the movies sounds like this launch the missile bye thank you so a common question that people often ask is how beatboxer actually practice how beatboxer memorize their their notes well in order to answer this question i will need your help so if if you will let us just do one beat box together and it is really simple i promise well before we start couple sounds that you want to know first high head basically you pronounce to make the high head right perfect then rain shot just pronounce the c yes then i drum pronounce the to afterwards we got snare okay so here goes the notes we will start very slowly and then we will speed it up join me if you will speed up give yourself a round of applause thank you thank you and also today i brought a special machine here and i am pretty sure that you can already see got a six buttons on it and this machine can play multiple sounds at the same time and the limit will be six so let us do a sound check first one two three four well actually this is four five six all right you ready for this machine to play six sounds at the same time one forward five six okay okay now let us get something exciting that is something exciting okay uh i would love to share my favorite music with you today and first of all germany house turn it down switch authentic part part say okay level up keep the clap up let us go i like to moon and move it i like to moon and move it you like to you can be better i like the move moving i like to moving moving you like to thank you so much thank you so much thank so much thank you go find the joy thank you thank you so much,coward ma,infinite potential of human voice
we get the house lights on for one second i need honesty raise your hand if you did dumb as a teenager all right now the difference between us is that we had parents that cared about us we had a positive adults in our lives that kind of gave us a path and we had some wealth and some resources but what if you are a child that has none of that what if you are in the foster care system and there is not a person that you can call your parent what if there is not an adult showing you the right path what if you have no money in you are living in extreme poverty so i took this journey in 2003 we had just made a movie called road trip in a movie called old school and i do very mature movies um and this is about five years before the hangover kind of revolution my life revolutionized my life but the thing that really changed my life was in 2003 i went to solar juvenile hall in the san forzando valley right here and met some absolutely amazing kids here are some of them their little art is right here 14 years old facing a life sentence and i walked into a prison for my first time and these were 14 15 16 year old that were facing life in prison or on one side of the table i met avid regret and avid agrestic two days before i showed up for my first time had been sentenced to 200 years in prison with no chance of parole ever he will die in prison for standing next to somebody that shot a rival gang member in the but 200 years across the table from him was prophet walker prophet walker had was still fighting his case and he ultimately got six years in adult prison for getting into a fistfight on a train and fracturing someone's jaw so we are gonna come back to them in a second let me tell you about the current state of the system so america now has the dubious distinction of leading the world's prison population we account for 25% of prisoners but only i of the global population we are the most jailing country in the world ahead of saudi arabia china and we are the largest prison system in the free world check out the stats here while we spend nine thousand a year to educate kids in the k through 12 system we spend two hundred thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them one child to incarcerate in a year two hundred thousand dollars five times what would cost to send him to hazard to put them in prison with virtually no treatment and services whatsoever our prison system has a fourteen billion dollar budget and a seventy four percent recidivism rate for the population i work with the teenagers and the young adults 18 to 25 years old which means if public safety is the ultimate goal we are actually making our communities less safe nobody in this room would spend 14 billion dollars at their company that fails seven out of ten times we would shut it down but unfortunately we do not have that luxury here but we know how to solve this problem so the data shows that if kids while they are incarcerated to get a high school diploma or get it reduces recidivism which is reincarnation by five to ten percent more data shows if they go to college and they get their first two years of college and a a degree that is an additional ten percent introduction combine that with all the things you can do when they come home housing substance abuse therapy employment a different peer group if you combine all those things together you can reduce your citizen by 50% to take it to 34% and save billions of dollars in the taxes that all of us are paying and if you do not believe that fixing the criminal justice system is your issue please note that all kids not just kids that commit crimes but all kids are affected by these policies since 1980 while prison expenditures has risen by 436 percent our higher education funding has decreased by 13% that is a tragedy so what is stopping us number one pure politics liberals are scared of looking soft on crime conservatives want to look tough on crime in the 1990s the pendulum swung columbine happened experts at different universities said we have a new breed of kids they are super predators we need to lock them up not saying that kids have the capacity to change as we all know anyone that has kids we decided to treat them like adults fear them and lock them away forever before that richer ninon started on drugs we have spent a trillion dollars since president ninon on the war of drugs we spend 51 billion dollars a year in the ward of drug on the war of drugs what has this accomplished addiction rates are the same overdose deaths are an allative high and drugs cost less than before a trillion dollars we failed completely here's the good news there is a movement growing during this last recession it is funny that it takes a recession to actually change a system this has become a bipartisan issue conservatives hate big government and what is worse big government that a bloated prison system that fails like it does they hate wasteful spending and you have a lot of christian conservatives that believe in redemption forgiveness and second chances so last year as jordan said i co-wrote a bill called so 260 which was to look at all kids that committed crimes as children and were given life sentences and this was a bill that should not have gotten any republican votes it really probably should not have passed in the current climate but we ended up getting nine republicans newt gingrich came on board and supported it wrote an opted grove norquist came on board not only talking about the fiscal savings of the bill but also about the human value were saving when we believe in kids and give them second chances and avid regret who i taught you about at the beginning got 200 years in prison when i went to see him in prison and said so 260 was passed avid regret now knew that after he served 20 years if he did major transformation he would be able to go home to his mom governor brown signed the bill on the second day was on his desk and it is now the law six thousand five hundred young kids are now going home thank you now let us go back to my other student prophet walker right here he is not the white guy and he is not the guy with the big ears prophet walker went to prison in prison he got his aka degree unfortunately in prison you can only get to an aka degree because there is no online classes we just changed that we have an online pilot we are at one prison kids can get on a computer and actually take online classes and now for the first time ever in the history of the prison system we can get them to their a but profit got his first two years of college done while he is an inmate in prison he got accepted into the loyal paramount school of science and engineering he left prison right onto emu's campus full scholarship within a week of getting there he calls me and says that he will do anything he has a daughter he will sweep floors just he needs a job he went to a fundraiser met someone that owned an engineering company within a two weeks of leaving prison he was making a hundred and ten dollars an hour not minimum wage $8.00 an hour a hundred and ten dollars an hour week a week from leaving prison working for this company went back to watts where he is from where he saw that all the problems where he left before he went to prison were still existing and he just found out that the assembly member that represents watts is leaving office so prophet walker is now running for state assembly and has now outraced his competition in the last three periods as the frontrunner to win the assembly seat and i knew him behind a jail cell at 15 years old so so now is the time for the private sector for us for all the brains for the resources in this room to push government to do the right thing fiscally and morally which is why i want to pitch today an prize around reducing recidivism these kids have grown up without adults loving them without role models without proper parenting guidance let us be those adults to these kids and show them that their worst act is not going to define their entire lives thank you very much,scout nudnick,how do we reduce recidivism
