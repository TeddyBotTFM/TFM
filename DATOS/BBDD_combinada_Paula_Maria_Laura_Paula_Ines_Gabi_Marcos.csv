The power of the vulnerability,Brené Brown,"So, I'll start with this: a couple years ago, an event planner called me because I was going to do a speaking event. And she called, and she said, ""I'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer."" And I thought, ""Well, what's the struggle?"" And she said, ""Well, I saw you speak, and I'm going to call you a researcher, I think, but I'm afraid if I call you a researcher, no one will come, because they'll think you're boring and irrelevant."" (Laughter) And I was like, ""Okay."" And she said, ""But the thing I liked about your talk is you're a storyteller. So I think what I'll do is just call you a storyteller."" And of course, the academic, insecure part of me was like, ""You're going to call me a what?"" And she said, ""I'm going to call you a storyteller."" And I was like, ""Why not 'magic pixie'?"" (Laughter) I was like, ""Let me think about this for a second."" I tried to call deep on my courage. And I thought, you know, I am a storyteller. I'm a qualitative researcher. I collect stories; that's what I do. And maybe stories are just data with a soul. And maybe I'm just a storyteller. And so I said, ""You know what? Why don't you just say I'm a researcher-storyteller."" And she went, ""Ha ha. There's no such thing."" (Laughter) So I'm a researcher-storyteller, and I'm going to talk to you today   we're talking about expanding perception   and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent. And this is where my story starts. When I was a young researcher, doctoral student, my first year, I had a research professor who said to us, ""Here's the thing, if you cannot measure it, it does not exist."" And I thought he was just sweet-talking me. I was like, ""Really?"" and he was like, ""Absolutely."" And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor's and a master's in social work, and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work, so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the ""life's messy, love it."" And I'm more of the, ""life's messy, clean it up, organize it and put it into a bento box."" (Laughter) And so to think that I had found my way, to found a career that takes me   really, one of the big sayings in social work is, ""Lean into the discomfort of the work."" And I'm like, knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A's. That was my mantra. So I was very excited about this. And so I thought, you know what, this is the career for me, because I am interested in some messy topics. But I want to be able to make them not messy. I want to understand them. I want to hack into these things that I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see. So where I started was with connection. Because, by the time you're a social worker for 10 years, what you realize is that connection is why we're here. It's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. This is what it's all about. It doesn't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice, mental health and abuse and neglect, what we know is that connection, the ability to feel connected, is   neurobiologically that's how we're wired   it's why we're here. So I thought, you know what, I'm going to start with connection. Well, you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss, and she tells you 37 things that you do really awesome, and one ""opportunity for growth?"" (Laughter) And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth, right? Well, apparently this is the way my work went as well, because, when you ask people about love, they tell you about heartbreak. When you ask people about belonging, they'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded. And when you ask people about connection, the stories they told me were about disconnection. So very quickly   really about six weeks into this research   I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didn't understand or had never seen. And so I pulled back out of the research and thought, I need to figure out what this is. And it turned out to be shame. And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection: Is there something about me that, if other people know it or see it, that I won't be worthy of connection? The things I can tell you about it: It's universal; we all have it. The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection. No one wants to talk about it, and the less you talk about it, the more you have it. What underpinned this shame, this ""I'm not good enough,""   which, we all know that feeling: ""I'm not blank enough. I'm not thin enough, rich enough, beautiful enough, smart enough, promoted enough."" The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability. This idea of, in order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen, really seen. And you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability. And so I thought, this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick. I'm going in, I'm going to figure this stuff out, I'm going to spend a year, I'm going to totally deconstruct shame, I'm going to understand how vulnerability works, and I'm going to outsmart it. So I was ready, and I was really excited. As you know, it's not going to turn out well. (Laughter) You know this. So, I could tell you a lot about shame, but I'd have to borrow everyone else's time. But here's what I can tell you that it boils down to   and this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned in the decade of doing this research. My one year turned into six years: Thousands of stories, hundreds of long interviews, focus groups. At one point, people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories   thousands of pieces of data in six years. And I kind of got a handle on it. I kind of understood, this is what shame is, this is how it works. I wrote a book, I published a theory, but something was not okay   and what it was is that, if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness   that's what this comes down to, a sense of worthiness   they have a strong sense of love and belonging   and folks who struggle for it, and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough. There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it. And that was, the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging. That's it. They believe they're worthy. And to me, the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we're not worthy of connection, was something that, personally and professionally, I felt like I needed to understand better. So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness, where I saw people living that way, and just looked at those. What do these people have in common? I have a slight office supply addiction, but that's another talk. So I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie, and I was like, what am I going to call this research? And the first words that came to my mind were ""whole-hearted."" These are whole-hearted people, living from this deep sense of worthiness. So I wrote at the top of the manila folder, and I started looking at the data. In fact, I did it first in a four-day, very intensive data analysis, where I went back, pulled the interviews, the stories, pulled the incidents. What's the theme? What's the pattern? My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing, where I'm just writing and in my researcher mode. And so here's what I found. What they had in common was a sense of courage. And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute. Courage, the original definition of courage, when it first came into the English language   it's from the Latin word ""cor,"" meaning ""heart""   and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart. And so these folks had, very simply, the courage to be imperfect. They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others, because, as it turns out, we can't practice compassion with other people if we can't treat ourselves kindly. And the last was they had connection, and   this was the hard part   as a result of authenticity, they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were, which you have to absolutely do that for connection. The other thing that they had in common was this: They fully embraced vulnerability. They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful. They didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable, nor did they really talk about it being excruciating   as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing. They just talked about it being necessary. They talked about the willingness to say, ""I love you"" first ... the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ... the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram. They're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out. They thought this was fundamental. I personally thought it was betrayal. I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research, where our job   you know, the definition of research is to control and predict, to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict. And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting. This led to a little breakdown   (Laughter)   which actually looked more like this. (Laughter) And it did. I call it a breakdown; my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening. (Laughter) A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown, but I assure you, it was a breakdown. And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist. Let me tell you something: you know who you are when you call your friends and say, ""I think I need to see somebody. Do you have any recommendations?"" Because about five of my friends were like, ""Wooo, I wouldn't want to be your therapist."" (Laughter) I was like, ""What does that mean?"" And they're like, ""I'm just saying, you know. Don't bring your measuring stick."" (Laughter) I was like, ""Okay."" So I found a therapist. My first meeting with her, Diana   I brought in my list of the way the whole-hearted live, and I sat down. And she said, ""How are you?"" And I said, ""I'm great. I'm okay."" She said, ""What's going on?"" And this is a therapist who sees therapists, because we have to go to those, because their B.S. meters are good. (Laughter) And so I said, ""Here's the thing, I'm struggling."" And she said, ""What's the struggle?"" And I said, ""Well, I have a vulnerability issue. And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness, but it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy, of creativity, of belonging, of love. And I think I have a problem, and I need some help."" And I said, ""But here's the thing: no family stuff, no childhood shit."" (Laughter) ""I just need some strategies."" (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. So she goes like this. (Laughter) And then I said, ""It's bad, right?"" And she said, ""It's neither good nor bad."" (Laughter) ""It just is what it is."" And I said, ""Oh my God, this is going to suck."" (Laughter) And it did, and it didn't. And it took about a year. And you know how there are people that, when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important, that they surrender and walk into it. A: that's not me, and B: I don't even hang out with people like that. (Laughter) For me, it was a yearlong street fight. It was a slugfest. Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back. I lost the fight, but probably won my life back. And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they, the whole-hearted, what choices they were making, and what we are doing with vulnerability. Why do we struggle with it so much? Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability? No. So this is what I learned. We numb vulnerability   when we're waiting for the call. It was funny, I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook that says, ""How would you define vulnerability? What makes you feel vulnerable?"" And within an hour and a half, I had 150 responses. Because I wanted to know what's out there. Having to ask my husband for help because I'm sick, and we're newly married; initiating sex with my husband; initiating sex with my wife; being turned down; asking someone out; waiting for the doctor to call back; getting laid off; laying off people. This is the world we live in. We live in a vulnerable world. And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability. And I think there's evidence   and it's not the only reason this evidence exists, but I think it's a huge cause   We are the most in-debt ... obese ... addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history. The problem is   and I learned this from the research   that you cannot selectively numb emotion. You can't say, here's the bad stuff. Here's vulnerability, here's grief, here's shame, here's fear, here's disappointment. I don't want to feel these. I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. (Laughter) I don't want to feel these. And I know that's knowing laughter. I hack into your lives for a living. God. (Laughter) You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects, our emotions. You cannot selectively numb. So when we numb those, we numb joy, we numb gratitude, we numb happiness. And then, we are miserable, and we are looking for purpose and meaning, and then we feel vulnerable, so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. And it becomes this dangerous cycle. One of the things that I think we need to think about is why and how we numb. And it doesn't just have to be addiction. The other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain certain. Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty. ""I'm right, you're wrong. Shut up."" That's it. Just certain. The more afraid we are, the more vulnerable we are, the more afraid we are. This is what politics looks like today. There's no discourse anymore. There's no conversation. There's just blame. You know how blame is described in the research? A way to discharge pain and discomfort. We perfect. If there's anyone who wants their life to look like this, it would be me, but it doesn't work. Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks. (Laughter) Which just, I hope in 100 years, people will look back and go, ""Wow."" (Laughter) And we perfect, most dangerously, our children. Let me tell you what we think about children. They're hardwired for struggle when they get here. And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand, our job is not to say, ""Look at her, she's perfect. My job is just to keep her perfect   make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh."" That's not our job. Our job is to look and say, ""You know what? You're imperfect, and you're wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging."" That's our job. Show me a generation of kids raised like that, and we'll end the problems, I think, that we see today. We pretend that what we do doesn't have an effect on people. We do that in our personal lives. We do that corporate   whether it's a bailout, an oil spill ... a recall. We pretend like what we're doing doesn't have a huge impact on other people. I would say to companies, this is not our first rodeo, people. We just need you to be authentic and real and say ... ""We're sorry. We'll fix it."" But there's another way, and I'll leave you with this. This is what I have found: To let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts, even though there's no guarantee   and that's really hard, and I can tell you as a parent, that's excruciatingly difficult   to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror, when we're wondering, ""Can I love you this much? Can I believe in this this passionately? Can I be this fierce about this?"" just to be able to stop and, instead of catastrophizing what might happen, to say, ""I'm just so grateful, because to feel this vulnerable means I'm alive."" And the last, which I think is probably the most important, is to believe that we're enough. Because when we work from a place, I believe, that says, ""I'm enough"" ... then we stop screaming and start listening, we're kinder and gentler to the people around us, and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves. That's all I have. Thank you."
A new life for mobile phones,Rajeevan Amirtharajah,okay so today I'm gonna talk about  something that all of you probably have  in your hands in your backpacks in your  pockets and you carry with you all the  time  and you probably don't think too much  about it unless you're worried about its  battery running out right and that's  this mobile phone but I want you to  think about this  in 2011 1.5 billion mobile phones were  sold worldwide and the average user  upgrades their phone after only two  years where do you think all those  mobile phones away well if people are  like me a lot of those phones are  sitting in a drawer somewhere the phones  that you see behind you for example are  in my junk drawer in my kitchen two  phones an iPod Touch so as a fraction  50% of the mobile phones in my house and  100% of the iPod Touches in my house are  sitting in the junk drawer right now  that's good because they're not in a  landfill so I must feel somehow that  these phones have some kind of value but  you know sometimes we move it's time to  clean out that junk drawer what am I  gonna do with those phones to dispose of  them in a way which is environmentally  responsible right now there are two main  Options for disposal options for the end of life of your  disposal mobile phone or any electronics  okay the obvious one is to recycle it so  you take the phone you crush it you  extract its valuable raw materials so  these are things like glass copper  chromium and those materials go back  into our industrial ecosystem to make  new stuff okay that's a great option 100  percent of old phones should be recycled  but it turns out in 2012 people  projected that only 15% of old phones  were going to be end up in the recycling  stream okay so clearly I'm not the only  one who has their own phones in their  drawer second option is what's called  refurbishing so you take your phone to a  business and that business cleans up the  phone and they sell it to another  consumer to use as a mobile phone now  this sounds like a really great option  because you would think that for every  old phone that gets refurbished that  means one less new mobile phone has to  be manufactured but turns out it's not  the case experts believe that only that  refurbishing mobile phones only  decreases new phone production by about  5% and there's a lot of reasons for that  but one  main reasons is that the customer who  tends to buy refurbished mobile phones  usually a first-time mobile customer and  as soon as they can afford to they're  gonna upgrade to a phone with the latest  and greatest features now the phones I  go into drawers most phones and they go  into drawers aren't dead right they  still turn on they have working speakers  microphones displays they have a  microprocessor that runs software so we  ask what if there's a third option  instead of recycling or refurbishing the  phone  what if we could repurpose it modify its  hardware modified software a little bit  so that it could replace some other  electronic device okay decrease the  amount of manufacturing we have and  maybe be beneficial for the environment  now why we even ask this question in the  first place so I spend most of my time  Power consumption or actually my graduate students spend  most of their time were worrying about  the power consumption of what's behind  me here this is an integrated circuit or  computer chip and the reason we want to  decrease the power consumption is to  make you know electronics smaller and  lighter make your battery last longer  and these are all kind of important  problems but actually we worked on this  for a while we certainly had one of  those sort of Oh realizations right what  if we reduced the power consumption of  our chips so much that actually takes  more energy to make the chip than the  chip uses during its typical operating  life okay so to answer this question we  had my graduate student they do all the  work John Oliver and my colleagues thank  you touch akela Fred Chong and Roland  Geyer we look into this several years  ago and the results of our analysis are  here  so it turns out for the type of chip  that you typically see in a mobile phone  it takes 60 times more energy to make  the chip in the first place than the  chip uses joinings typical two to  three-year operating life okay now if  you're worried about decreasing the  power consumption of integrated circuits  it's kind of a depressing result we're  working on that tiny little sliver right  and it takes all that big box to make  the chip in the first place okay  but instead of getting depressed I sort  of realized that this is not really a  fair comparison right that chip would  not exist in the first place if we  didn't first invest the energy it takes  to manufacture  it that energy is what an economist  would call a sunk cost can't get it back  and people get a lot of utility out of  decreasing the power consumption of  their chips right smaller electronics  longer battery life so my students still  work on that problem but we wanted to  figure out if there a way we can get  more return for that initial investment  of manufacturing energy okay and we'll  The phone think about a phone instead of one chip  there's usually six to ten chips like  that so the investment of energy is that  much higher at first we looked at you  know can we just disassemble the phone  take the chips out and use them again in  other places and it turns out that may  not make a lot of economic sense because  of the time and labor involved in doing  the disassembly process so instead of  reusing the chips we thought about  reusing the entire phone itself we tried  to think about what kind of device could  an old mobile phone completely replace  in terms of its functionality okay and  The parking tag the one we looked at replacing is the  one on the left here this little thing  is an electronic parking tag it's a  really simple device what you do is you  take your phone or credit card and you  charge it up with minutes then when you  park your car in a metered spot you  paying this tag out or put it on the  dashboard it starts off a little  countdown timer with a display and then  when the parking attendant comes by they  look to see if your time is expired and  you get a ticket or you don't or  whatever yeah it's a really simple  functionality so instead of building a  new specific device to do this I had my  student Frank maker create that  prototype on the right it's using an old  nokia n8 II phone he wrote a little app  that basically does all the functions of  the electronic parking tag and you'll  know so you'll notice it also has  something extra it's got this little  solar panel attached to this side okay  with some electronics on a prototyping  board to convert the solar panel voltage  to something the phone likes why is that  there well I'm sure you all know what's  the first thing to go bad on your mobile  phone it's battery and if you want are  thinking about repurposing your mobile  phone to do something else you may want  to think about replacing that battery  with a different kind of power supply  okay so here's a picture of that  prototype being used as an electronic  parking tag on the dashboard of a  Frank's car  in the inset you can see little  screenshot from his app it all works  just fine it doesn't look very pretty I  grant you that but on the other hand  it's pretty obvious that you can easily  optimize the hardware the software the  packaging to make it look good and make  it look like something you'd be happy to  have on the dashboard of your car but  the question is now that we went to all  this trouble of repurposing this old  phone and we actually done anything to  benefit the environment and to do that  we worked with some folks who are  experts in what's called industrial  ecology to do a lifecycle analysis and  to see what the global impacts for the  environment are of doing this  repurposing trevor's Inc from the  University of California Santa Barbara  helped us with this and here's the  results of his study or our study so it  turns out that this example for example  you're looking at global warming if you  repurpose the electronic repurpose the  phone is electronic parking tag you can  result in a net decrease in global  warming whereas if you simply refurbish  the phone and use it again as a phone it  actually contributes to an increase in  global warming okay once you account for  all of the different impacts of  components and so on and we looked at  two options so the two bars on the top  one corresponds to using the phone as a  parking tag with solar panel the other  two using it as a parking tag with a  battery and both those options are  better than refurbishing which you would  expect but it turns out that using it  with a battery is actually better than  using it with a solar panel now why is  that the reason is because you have to  account for the energy it took to make  the solar panel if that solar panel had  been reclaimed from another product or  another waste stream then the results of  analysis would flip it would make more  sense to use the repurposed phone with  the solar panel than the battery now  this is a kind of a really important  point whenever we're thinking about the  environmental impact of our industrial  production like with electronics the  context is everything so for example the  size of those bars the contribution to  global warming doesn't just depend on  what you're doing with that phone or  with that repurposed phone it depends on  where the charger is plugged in so for  example your phone is running off a  battery as a parking tag if you plug  that phone in and recharge it in  California where a lot of our grid  electricity comes from renewal  sources that contributes a lot less to  global warming than if you took the same  parking tag and plugged it in somewhere  like China where a lot of the  electricity comes from coal fired power  plants say and in fact what may matter  more even than what you do with that  phone or that repurpose phone is  actually what you do with the charger so  let's say you've got your phone  repurposed as a parking tag you're gonna  charge it up before you go to campus and  then put it on your dashboard if you  leave the charger plugged in you take  your phone out hmm go to campus but that  charger does is it takes energy from the  grid and transfer it to the battery of  the phone okay but it takes a little bit  for itself every time it does that and  when you disconnect the phone from the  charger that charger doesn't stop taking  energy for itself it's still going to  use some energy from the grid and if you  leave that charger plugged in for about  say 20% of the time you're using that  repurposed phone as a parking tag the  charger is taking more energy that's  transferring to the phone context so  where do we go from here  we've looked at repurposing a mobile  phone to do other do the tasks of other  electronic devices it looks like it's  going to help the environment in some  ways how do we think about making that  happen or making it easier well for  inspiration we can look at this again  mm-hmm no joke this is my daughter's  big-girl bed okay  she's almost five you might not be able  to tell she kind of likes Hello Kitty  but the reason I just want to show this  is because this bed used to be her crib  her baby crib you can see that the  headboard and the footboard with sides  of the crib now the company that  designed and manufactured the crib did  it in such a way that the consumer could  basically take the crib apart which is  some Allen wrenches and I sold a  conversion kit that let us take that  crib and scale it up to a full-size bed  okay means one less bed has to be  manufactured and in terms of impact on  the environment we would expect that to  be again on that win so the folks who  designed mobile phones and other  electronics they ought to be thinking  like the folks who design baby cribs and  building the phones and  designing them in such a way that makes  it easy either for the consumer or maybe  for a business to convert the phones to  another type of use and decreased  environmental footprint of our  electronics on our environment so the  next time you upgrade your phone you've  got to put that old phone in the drawers  stop and ask yourself you know what did  this old phone be now that I don't need  it to be a phone anymore oh but first go  home and unplug all your chargers thank  you
Strange answer to the psychopath,Jon Ronson,"The story starts: I was at a friend's house, and she had on her shelf a copy of the DSM manual, which is the manual of mental disorders. It lists every known mental disorder. And it used to be, back in the '50s, a very slim pamphlet. And then it got bigger and bigger and bigger, and now it's 886 pages long. And it lists currently 374 mental disorders. So I was leafing through it, wondering if I had any mental disorders, and it turns out I've got 12. (Laughter) I've got generalized anxiety disorder, which is a given. I've got nightmare disorder, which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure, and all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street going, ""You're a failure!"" (Laughter) I've got parent-child relational problems, which I blame my parents for. (Laughter) I'm kidding. I'm not kidding. I'm kidding. And I've got malingering. And I think it's actually quite rare to have both malingering and generalized anxiety disorder, because malingering tends to make me feel very anxious. Anyway, I was looking through this book, wondering if I was much crazier than I thought I was, or maybe it's not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder if you're not a trained professional, or maybe the psychiatry profession has a kind of strange desire to label what's essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder. I didn't know which of these was true, but I thought it was kind of interesting, and I thought maybe I should meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view, which is how I ended up having lunch with the Scientologists. (Laughter) It was a man called Brian, who runs a crack team of Scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies. They're called the CCHR. And I said to him, ""Can you prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudo-science that can't be trusted?"" And he said, ""Yes, we can prove it to you."" And I said, ""How?"" And he said, ""We're going to introduce you to Tony."" And I said, ""Who's Tony?"" And he said, ""Tony's in Broadmoor."" Now, Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital. It used to be known as the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane. It's where they send the serial killers, and the people who can't help themselves. And I said to Brian, ""Well, what did Tony do?"" And he said, ""Hardly anything. He beat someone up or something, and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence. But he faked it too well, and now he's stuck in Broadmoor and nobody will believe he's sane. Do you want us to try and get you into Broadmoor to meet Tony?"" So I said, ""Yes, please."" So I got the train to Broadmoor. I began to yawn uncontrollably around Kempton Park, which apparently is what dogs also do when anxious, they yawn uncontrollably. And we got to Broadmoor. And I got taken through gate after gate after gate after gate into the wellness center, which is where you get to meet the patients. It looks like a giant Hampton Inn. It's all peach and pine and calming colors. And the only bold colors are the reds of the panic buttons. And the patients started drifting in. And they were quite overweight and wearing sweatpants, and quite docile-looking. And Brian the Scientologist whispered to me, ""They're medicated,"" which, to the Scientologists, is like the worst evil in the world, but I'm thinking it's probably a good idea. (Laughter) And then Brian said, ""Here's Tony."" And a man was walking in. And he wasn't overweight, he was in very good physical shape. And he wasn't wearing sweatpants, he was wearing a pinstripe suit. And he had his arm outstretched like someone out of The Apprentice. He looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me that he was very sane. And he sat down. And I said, ""So is it true that you faked your way in here?"" And he said, ""Yep. Yep. Absolutely. I beat someone up when I was 17. And I was in prison awaiting trial, and my cellmate said to me, 'You know what you have to do? Fake madness. Tell them you're mad, you'll get sent to some cushy hospital. Nurses will bring you pizzas, you'll have your own PlayStation.'"" I said, ""Well, how did you do it?"" He said, ""Well, I asked to see the prison psychiatrist. And I'd just seen a film called 'Crash,' in which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls. So I said to the psychiatrist, 'I get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls.'"" And I said, ""What else?"" He said, ""Oh, yeah. I told the psychiatrist that I wanted to watch women as they died, because it would make me feel more normal."" I said, ""Where'd you get that from?"" He said, ""Oh, from a biography of Ted Bundy that they had at the prison library."" Anyway, he faked madness too well, he said. And they didn't send him to some cushy hospital. They sent him to Broadmoor. And the minute he got there, said he took one look at the place, asked to see the psychiatrist, said, ""There's been a terrible misunderstanding. I'm not mentally ill."" I said, ""How long have you been here for?"" He said, ""Well, if I'd just done my time in prison for the original crime, I'd have got five years. I've been in Broadmoor for 12 years."" Tony said that it's a lot harder to convince people you're sane than it is to convince them you're crazy. He said, ""I thought the best way to seem normal would be to talk to people normally about normal things like football or what's on TV. I subscribe to New Scientist, and recently they had an article about how the U.S. Army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives. So I said to a nurse, 'Did you know that the U.S. Army is training bumblebees to sniff out explosives?' When I read my medical notes, I saw they'd written: 'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.'"" (Laughter) He said, ""You know, they're always looking out for nonverbal clues to my mental state. But how do you sit in a sane way? How do you cross your legs in a sane way? It's just impossible."" When Tony said that to me, I thought to myself, ""Am I sitting like a journalist? Am I crossing my legs like a journalist?"" He said, ""You know, I've got the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me, and I've got the 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips' rapist on the other side of me. So I tend to stay in my room a lot because I find them quite frightening. And they take that as a sign of madness. They say it proves that I'm aloof and grandiose."" So, only in Broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness. Anyway, he seemed completely normal to me, but what did I know? And when I got home I emailed his clinician, Anthony Maden. I said, ""What's the story?"" And he said, ""Yep. We accept that Tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence, because his hallucinations -- that had seemed quite cliche to begin with -- just vanished the minute he got to Broadmoor. However, we have assessed him, and we've determined that what he is is a psychopath."" And in fact, faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath. It's on the checklist: cunning, manipulative. So, faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain has gone wrong. And I spoke to other experts, and they said the pinstripe suit -- classic psychopath -- speaks to items one and two on the checklist: glibness, superficial charm and grandiose sense of self-worth. And I said, ""Well, but why didn't he hang out with the other patients?"" Classic psychopath -- it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy. So all the things that had seemed most normal about Tony was evidence, according to his clinician, that he was mad in this new way. He was a psychopath. And his clinician said to me, ""If you want to know more about psychopaths, you can go on a psychopath-spotting course run by Robert Hare, who invented the psychopath checklist."" So I did. I went on a psychopath-spotting course, and I am now a certified -- and I have to say, extremely adept -- psychopath spotter. So, here's the statistics: One in a hundred regular people is a psychopath. So there's 1,500 people in his room. Fifteen of you are psychopaths. Although that figure rises to four percent of CEOs and business leaders, so I think there's a very good chance there's about 30 or 40 psychopaths in this room. It could be carnage by the end of the night. (Laughter) Hare said the reason why is because capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior -- the lack of empathy, the glibness, cunning, manipulative. In fact, capitalism, perhaps at its most remorseless, is a physical manifestation of psychopathy. It's like a form of psychopathy that's come down to affect us all. Hare said, ""You know what? Forget about some guy at Broadmoor who may or may not have faked madness. Who cares? That's not a big story. The big story,"" he said, ""is corporate psychopathy. You want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths."" So I gave it a try. I wrote to the Enron people. I said, ""Could I come and interview you in prison, to find out it you're psychopaths?"" (Laughter) And they didn't reply. (Laughter) So I changed tack. I emailed ""Chainsaw Al"" Dunlap, the asset stripper from the 1990s. He would come into failing businesses and close down 30 percent of the workforce, just turn American towns into ghost towns. And I emailed him and I said, ""I believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you ... special, and interested in the predatory spirit, and fearless. Can I come and interview you about your special brain anomaly?"" And he said, ""Come on over!"" (Laughter) So I went to Al Dunlap's grand Florida mansion. It was filled with sculptures of predatory animals. There were lions and tigers -- he was taking me through the garden -- there were falcons and eagles, he was saying, ""Over there you've got sharks and --"" he was saying this in a less effeminate way -- ""You've got more sharks and you've got tigers."" It was like Narnia. (Laughter) And then we went into his kitchen. Now, Al Dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies, he'd close down 30 percent of the workforce. And he'd quite often fire people with a joke. Like, for instance, one famous story about him, somebody came up to him and said, ""I've just bought myself a new car."" And he said, ""Well, you may have a new car, but I'll tell you what you don't have -- a job."" So in his kitchen -- he was in there with his wife, Judy, and his bodyguard, Sean -- and I said, ""You know how I said in my email that you might have a special brain anomaly that makes you special?"" He said, ""Yeah, it's an amazing theory, it's like Star Trek. You're going where no man has gone before."" And I said, ""Well --"" (Clears throat) (Laughter) Some psychologists might say that this makes you --"" (Mumbles) (Laughter) And he said, ""What?"" And I said, ""A psychopath."" And I said, ""I've got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket. Can I go through them with you?"" And he looked intrigued despite himself, and he said, ""Okay, go on."" And I said, ""Okay. Grandiose sense of self-worth."" Which I have to say, would have been hard for him to deny, because he was standing under a giant oil painting of himself. (Laughter) He said, ""Well, you've got to believe in you!"" And I said, ""Manipulative."" He said, ""That's leadership."" (Laughter) And I said, ""Shallow affect, an inability to experience a range of emotions."" He said, ""Who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions?"" So he was going down the psychopath checklist, basically turning it into ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" (Laughter) But I did notice something happening to me the day I was with Al Dunlap. Whenever he said anything to me that was kind of normal -- like he said ""no"" to juvenile delinquency, he said he got accepted into West Point, and they don't let delinquents in West Point. He said ""no"" to many short-term marital relationships. He's only ever been married twice. Admittedly, his first wife cited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like, but people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages in the heat of an argument, and his second marriage has lasted 41 years. So whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of non-psychopathic, I thought to myself, well I'm not going to put that in my book. And then I realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had kind of turned me a little bit psychopathic. Because I was desperate to shove him in a box marked ""Psychopath."" I was desperate to define him by his maddest edges. And I realized, my God -- this is what I've been doing for 20 years. It's what all journalists do. We travel across the world with our notepads in our hands, and we wait for the gems. And the gems are always the outermost aspects of our interviewee's personality. And we stitch them together like medieval monks, and we leave the normal stuff on the floor. And you know, this is a country that over-diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely. Childhood bipolar -- children as young as four are being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums, which scores them high on the bipolar checklist. When I got back to London, Tony phoned me. He said, ""Why haven't you been returning my calls?"" I said, ""Well, they say that you're a psychopath."" And he said, ""I'm not a psychopath."" He said, ""You know what? One of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse, but another item on the checklist is cunning, manipulative. So when you say you feel remorse for your crime, they say, 'Typical of the psychopath to cunningly say he feels remorse when he doesn't.' It's like witchcraft, they turn everything upside-down."" He said, ""I've got a tribunal coming up. Will you come to it?"" So I said okay. So I went to his tribunal. And after 14 years in Broadmoor, they let him go. They decided that he shouldn't be held indefinitely because he scores high on a checklist that might mean that he would have a greater than average chance of recidivism. So they let him go. And outside in the corridor he said to me, ""You know what, Jon? Everyone's a bit psychopathic."" He said, ""You are, I am. Well, obviously I am."" I said, ""What are you going to do now?"" He said, ""I'm going to go to Belgium. There's a woman there that I fancy. But she's married, so I'm going to have to get her split up from her husband."" (Laughter) Anyway, that was two years ago, and that's where my book ended. And for the last 20 months, everything was fine. Nothing bad happened. He was living with a girl outside London. He was, according to Brian the Scientologist, making up for lost time, which I know sounds ominous, but isn't necessarily ominous. Unfortunately, after 20 months, he did go back to jail for a month. He got into a ""fracas"" in a bar, he called it. Ended up going to jail for a month, which I know is bad, but at least a month implies that whatever the fracas was, it wasn't too bad. And then he phoned me. And you know what, I think it's right that Tony is out. Because you shouldn't define people by their maddest edges. And what Tony is, is he's a semi-psychopath. He's a gray area in a world that doesn't like gray areas. But the gray areas are where you find the complexity. It's where you find the humanity, and it's where you find the truth. And Tony said to me, ""Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar? I just want to thank you for everything you've done for me."" And I didn't go. What would you have done? Thank you."
Media and children ,Dimitri Christakis ,i'm a pediatrician a researcher and a parent and i became those things in that order and the reason the sequencing is important is because even though i was a doctor who took care of children for a while and i was a researcher who studied ways to keep them healthy it wasn't until i became a parent that i got interested in some might even say obsessed with early learning it was 14 years ago when my son was born and i took a month paternity leave to be with him in his third month of life and now in retrospect as a pediatrician i should have known better because i opted for the time when colic crescendos and i spent that month with him in a snuggly bouncing on a big blue ball and watching more daytime television than i have in my life and noticed that he was actually interested in it as much as i like to believe that my two-month-old was following cnn as closely as i was it was obvious to me that he wasn't and yet something about that experience was important to him Early experiences matter now why do these early experiences matter the typical newborn brain is 333 grams and in the first two years of life it actually triples in size it's an extraordinary period of brain growth unparalleled over the life course and you can see that here is both brain growth over the lifespan and you can see how steep the rise is early on and it continues to grow until about age 20 and i'll let you guys in the audience find yourselves over on the right there and see why you had such a hard time finding your car keys this morning now we're actually born with a lifetime supply of brain cells or neurons that's not what actually grows it's the connections between those brain cells what we call synapses that account for that brain growth and those synapses form based on early experiences if you will the mind is fine-tuned to the world that babies inhabit and to give you an example of that that you can all relate to any child born anywhere in the world can learn to speak any language fluently but if she isn't exposed to certain sounds early in the first few years of her life she can learn to speak another language later but she'll never sound like a native speaker so a baby born today in mainland china as amazing as it is can learn to speak fluent mandarin but if she doesn't hear english sounds early in her life she can learn to speak english later but as we all know we know such people she'll struggle making certain sounds it wasn't because she wasn't born with that capacity it was because her early experience didn't condition her mind to learn them now this graphic actually shows just that what you see is the brain and you see the neurons and the synapses connecting them we're born with about 2 500 synapses by age three we have 15 000. and then over time those connections are actually pruned in response to uh the external stimulation the external world that we live in now to give you another example of that this is the breathing pattern of a one day old infant listening to music and you can see here that he's listening to mozart and then stravinsky is put on and then mozart again now i show you this not to present some kind of an infantile critique of classical music but and those of you in the audience who are classic music aficionados might have a hypothesis about why stravinsky did this to his breathing pattern but the point is the point is that even at one day of life there is a discernible physiological reaction to what babies are actually hearing Pet scans now we know from decades of research that too little stimulation early on is bad for brain development i show you here two pet scans now pet scans are measures of brain function the brighter colors show more brain activity and on the left is a pet scan of a normal kindergartener and on the right is a pet scan of a child who is raised in a horribly neglected environment this is actually a pet scan from a child who is raised in a romanian orphanage and was profoundly neglected early in life and you'll notice that there are areas of his brain that show no activity at all it didn't develop as a result of too little stimulation now this is a horrific example of too little stimulation and the untoward consequences of it but the question we've had in our lab for some time is what about too much is it actually possible to over stimulate the developing brain or more appropriately to inappropriately stimulate the developing brain in ways that are actually not beneficial but harmful Too much and this is important because we're technologizing childhood today in a way that's unprecedented in 1970 the average age at which children began to watch television regularly was four years like this cute little girl here and today based on research that we've done it's four months it's not just how orally they watch but how much they watch the typical child before the age of five is watching about four and a half hours of tv a day that represents as much as 40 percent of their waking hours which brings us to baby einstein many of you probably have not seen baby einstein but i will show you a random 20 second clip from baby einstein day on the farm and here it is next one in that 20-second clip there were seven scene changes about one every three seconds it's about the most exhausting day on the farm since john steinbeck's grapes of wrath and of course it's nothing like being on a real farm right adults watching this find it discombobulating because your mind is trying to make a coherent narrative out of this and there is no coherent narrative it jumps all over the place but babies aren't trying to make a coherent narrative out of it they're not capable of doing that it's all of that screen change all of that stimulation that's keeping them actually engaged in the screen Overstimulation hypothesis so we've had for a while what we call the overstimulation hypothesis which is that prolonged exposure to this rapid image change during this critical window of brain development would pre-condition the mind to expect high levels of input and that would lead to inattention in later life so you watch enough baby einstein day on the farm as a baby and when you go to a farm as a school-aged child it's boring it's too slow how come there's no sheep suddenly popping into my face how come there's no marionette going back and forth why do i have to walk from here to there that's the general idea that you're conditioning the mind to that reality which doesn't actually exist Results and we we tested this uh some years ago and what we found was that the more television children watch before age three the more likely they were to actually have attentional problems at school age specifically for each hour that they watch before the age of three their chances of having attentional problems was increased by about 10 percent so a child who watched two hours of tv a day before the age of three would be 20 percent more likely to have attention problems compared to a child who watched none now what else did we find we found that the more cognitive stimulation children uh received and we measured cognitive stimulation in terms of how often parents read to their child how often they took them to the museum how often they sang to them we found that cognitive stimulation reduced the chances of attentional problems later in life in fact each hour of cognitive stimulation reduced them by about 30 percent so if you will these are two sides of the same coin there's certain things that we can do early on in our children's lives that enhance their ability to pay attention and certain things that we can do early on that actually impede them now if our hypothesis was right that it's based on the pacing of the programs and you might imagine that what children watch actually is important and so content would be key and i'll give you two examples of content to illustrate that point the first is the powerpuff girls movie the right mix of sugar and spice for satisfying rush i don't know how many of you have seen that but here's a scene from that okay so that was again you can see a lot of rapid sequencing in fact this was the first movie that was ever rated pg for non-stop frenetic animated action i'm not i'm not making it up that's the back of the box there now i want to contrast that with something that i'm sure you're all very familiar with uh really needs no introduction but this is a clip from mr rogers for you to watch hi oh hi there i'm fine how are you good thanks i brought my television neighbor to see what a restaurant was like oh i'm so glad can i show you to a table certainly i'm awfully busy today one of the waitresses is ill i see so i'm sort of doing double duty how about this this is fine thank you very much sit down and i'll be right back all right now when you come to a restaurant usually somebody shows you what table you're supposed to sit at and uh one of the first things you do is to put your napkin either on your lap or up here and then well this is the way a table is set so fred rogers invented reality tv he's not credited with it actually it's not reality right it's even slower paced than reality uh the waitress says i'm awfully busy but she doesn't seem the least bit hurried so you can see that they're very very real differences in pacing and when we followed up our study with a subsequent experiment to look at what children actually watch what you see is that educational programs like mr rogers pose no increased risk of attentional problems entertainment programs like the powerpuff girls movie increased the chances by about 60 percent and violent programming which i didn't show you increases it even by more than 100 and violent programs are typically even more rapidly sequenced Mouse TV now in the last year we've been building actually a mouse model of television viewing in my lab and you are now watching mouse tv here uh the sounds are from the cartoon network and the lights are uh basically photorhythmically generated by those sounds this is what it looks like these are the tv lounges here that the mice live in and they have speakers above and lights around them and what we do is we start about 10 days of life and these mice watch tv six hours a day for 42 days it's basically their entire childhood spent in front of a television which is not uncommon these days for some children even and then 10 days later we actually assess their behavior in a few ways i want to show with you the first test we do measures their activity and risk taking now we do what's called the open field test now mice have two kind of competing instincts you'll see them here one is to avoid being in the middle of anything because of course mice have very few friends and being in the middle of this open field is risky but of course they have a competing interest uh instinct to forage for food so at some point they do need to go into the middle and explore their environment now we put these mice in here and test them and we exploit the fact that it's a white mouse on a black background and with the computer above we can actually track their movement and you can see on the left is sort of a normal mouse spending most of its time around the perimeter but look at the one on the right notice how much time it spends in the middle but also notice just how much general activity this mouse is actually exhibiting so this is both a hyperactive and a risk-taking mouse and when we look at our are over stimulated compared to our control mice we find that the overstimulated might spend more time in the center and they enter the center more than the regular mice do the next test we do is what's called the novel object recognition and this tests short-term memory and learning we put a mouse in it in a box with two objects and the mouse will explore both of them get to know them if you will and then we take the mouse out and an hour later we've replaced one object with a novel object and we see how much time the mouse spends on each object now the mouse that is learning that has good short-term memory will spend more time on the novel object and you can see that here as opposed to the one on the right which is spending the same amount of time with both objects and what did we find well we found that our control mice our normal mice spent 75 percent of their time with a novel object but look at what our tv viewing or over stimulated mice did they spent the exact same amount of time it was as if they couldn't distinguish the two objects or they didn't care but one way or another they were not learning they were not acting like normal mice i want us to talk a little bit about a study we did with children it's a building block study it was a randomized trial here in a low-income clinic in seattle we took 200 children who were 18 to 24 months of age and we gave half of them blocks at the beginning of the study and half of them blocks at the end and their parents got what we call blocktivities monthly these were ways to play with your children with blocks sort the blocks stack the blocks count the blocks really simple things that come naturally to a lot of parents but what a lot of low-income parents don't do with their children regularly and here's what here's what happened the children who got the blocks 59 percent of them played with them on a typical day as opposed to 13 percent who didn't get the blocks initially they played for about 20 minutes a day about one and a half episodes a day and about 65 percent of the time was with their parent and then six months later we assessed their language and see on the right here that the kids who got the blocks late scored in the 42nd percentile which is below average but unfortunately not uncommon in low-income populations in seattle and for that matter around the world and the kids who got the blocks they actually scored a 56 percentile significantly better and slightly above average so promoting that kind of interactive play actually promoted language development in these young children Conclusion so i want to conclude by impressing on you that early childhood is very important for children and for mice and it's critical to their development and we need more real-time play today and less fast-paced media particularly for young children it's vitally important that we have that because if we change the beginning of the story we change the whole story thank you very very much you 
Narrative humility,Sayantani DasGupta,my name is Sian tani Dasgupta I'm a medical humanities educator and a writer and the idea that I want to share with you today is a philosophy of listening that I've been calling narrative humility but before I get started let me ask you all a question when was Listening the last time you felt truly listened to not just heard while somebody was texting but deeply attended to and I want you to grab ahold of that memory and kind of hold it within yourself for a moment because that sort of relational moment that's sort of being seen and being heard and being made to understand that we matter in this world that is one of our fundamental human needs and so let me ask you a follow-up question it is this when you are being listened to how did you know what were the behaviors of listening the eye contact or the touching that let you know that your listener was right there with you and not thinking about his groceries or something and I think that if I were to take a survey of everyone here I might get as different answers as there are people here because listening is not a one-size-fits-all activity right listening is not simply ten seconds of touching or eye contact it is nothing less than tapping into our innermost humanity and making that humanity present such that we might witness the humanity of another and so if listening is not a one-size-fits-all activity we get to the crux of my professional life which is okay then how do you teach it Teaching because that's my job as a professor in the program and narrative medicine at Columbia University and as a faculty member here the health advocacy program Sarah Lawrence College I teach healthcare professionals how to listen to stories because if being listened to is one of our fundamental human needs it is exponentially so in moments of illness crisis trauma in fact we often call stories the little boats that help us navigate the treacherous waters as we make our way from as Susan Sontag would say the kingdom of the well to the kingdom of the sick and hopefully back again and those stories need listeners they need witnesses of course nothing I'm saying is particularly new in ye olden days before doctors had anything of interest in their black bags right no MRIs or fancy lab tests what we had was the ability to show up what we had was the ability to listen to attend to somebody's birth life death everything in between but what's happened with the increasing technological skills necessary to modern medicine right reading MRIs interpreting lab tests is that we've pushed that first relational storied heart of medicine to the wayside and so what my colleagues in Medical Humanities and I are suggesting is that we hold on equal stead those two ways of knowing a scientific way of knowledge construction in a storied way it is just as important to be able to read interpret a radiograph an x-ray and read or interpret a patient's story easier said than done however in our modern age why because as we all know we are being inundated with information simultaneous narratives that we have to process all the time right we are in the midst of a cultural crisis of story a cultural crisis of listening so much so that Brown University neuroscientist Seth Horowitz has been writing about the fact that we are losing our higher-order listening functions in order in other words that ability to tune out what's unimportant and tune in one person one narrative one story in all of its twists and turns and unexpected happenings in fact there's this rich field of attention studies this is a cat scan of along with some nodules in it and some researchers showed it to Harvard University radiologists folks who are used to seeing stuff like this and they were asked what's wrong with this picture even when they were told can you find the gorillas in this image 85% of Harvard University radiologists did not see it and neither did I when I was reading about this study that in fact there is a you know little gorilla man up there in the upper left hand corner and this is but one of a series of such gorillas in the picture studies and it seems unbelievable right how can you not see the gorilla in the picture but I think it speaks to this crisis of story it speaks to this idea that we see what we expect to see we hear the story we expect to hear and this is actually really critical in medicine that we open ourselves up to stories in such a way that we are open to seeing the gorilla in the picture why just because it's nice or it might give us a more satisfying professional life which it will but because opening ourselves up to stories listening to stories deeply makes us do our job better in medicine not just that but perhaps more cost-effectively perhaps we might deliver a more just medicine so if I'm open to stories but I might know that this elderly woman that I'm seeing is an avid gardener and I might realize that she's using a new pesticide this year and that the syndrome of symptoms that I'm seeing are actually secondary to some kind of pesticide contamination and not some exotic disease disease that I'm about to spend thousands of dollars testing for a real story I was once treating a little girl for an ear infection a simple ear infection wasn't getting better and so I curled the mom into the office I was sure she was doing something and I said ma'am can you show me how you're giving this medicine okay doc and she drew up you know in a syringe the right amount of medicine the five cc's or whatever it was of the amoxicillin and she says well three times a day doc I draw it up and I administer the medicine she calls up to her ear this is of course an oral antibiotic and it was sheer arrogance on my part that I hadn't made that explicit and you know what are your infection you put the medicine in there like it makes sense right uh but I think that this wasn't so much of me being open to gorillas as it was a gorilla like hitting me over the head but certainly it made me do my job better okay so you say Oh opening ourselves up to stories is so important surely they're teaching that in medical school yeah no not so much um when I went to Hopkins Medical School a wonderful place to be from when you first walk in the first thing you see is this giant statue of Jesus on a pedestal kind of hearing over you and somehow you start getting the message that you two are expected to somehow be godlike in your medical practice peering over people you're told things like you're the best of the best and you're walking in the footsteps of giants and as you're being kind of fed this culture of hierarchy and medicine you're also systematically having your own humanity stripped from you it was very clear to us that the work patient care came first before going to the bathroom sleeping eating taking care of your own family and while this may seem like a good idea like sure I want a doctor who thinks about me before they think about going to the bathroom right we have to think at what cost at what cost and I think part of the cost is this culture of hierarchy and part of the cost is this stripping of humanity from people who are in fact tasked with listening to you in the most humane way possible how are we equipping them to do that in fact in medical school we tend to have this strange bifurcated view of listening we tend to think of well listening is something ineffable it's something magical you either are born with it or you don't have it and hey if you're a bad listener then we'll just shuffle you off to the lab or make sure you go into a subspecialty where you don't have to take care of patients too much so either we think about it that way or we tend to think of listening as a checklist we're told things like you know the studies show that if you sit at the bedside those doctors actually get sued less so when you go into a patient's room sit down and meet their eye for ten seconds and when they stop then pause for a couple of beats and repeat back the last three things they said to you so that they know you were listening now look I have nothing against sitting at the bedside or repeating what somebody said but to me this is not really listening this is just enacting listening this is kind of faking it till you make it and to me there's just no excuse for faking your humanity when you are tasked with assisting somebody in their most dire moment there is no excuse for faking your humanity at those moments and so I was delighted when I came out of training I found colleagues who also felt the same way colleagues who are thinking about things like narrative competence which is essentially the skill set to elicit interpret and act upon a patient's story the idea is that we would never graduate somebody from medical or nursing or therapy school who wasn't competent in their Anatomy or their physiology right why would we graduate somebody who wasn't competent in dealing with a patient's story so over the years I've actually started to think about this idea of competence and challenged it a little bit because while this is good to me it still has a little bit of that hierarchy right that on a pedestal thing and Parvez because when I was in medical school I would be given these courses in cultural competency and I would be given a list of 10 things that Dominican Americans believe or 10 things that Southeast Asians do and I be told you know sousta when somebody says ushio they mean this right so memorize this list and then you will be competent in dealing with this community not only is that troubling you cuz it's really reductionist but as a woman of color trainee here I was being told how to deal with these other patients when boy those other patients looked a lot like me right and so I was really intrigued when I read some educators who suggested that we'll maybe instead of cultural competence thinking about the other we should think about cultural humility train people to think about themselves their own prejudices and expectations and orientations towards stories so I thought well okay cultural humility but that seems to be something that you only do when those other people come into your office whatever that means what if we started thinking about narrative humility the fact that every human being has some aspect of the unknowable every story might have a gorilla waiting around the corner right so narrative humility is that sense of humility towards that which we do not know the face of the other the face we cannot know but to which we are responsible okay all OLM good narrative humility I'm trying to sell it to my medical colleagues and they're not buying it why because humility isn't sexy at least in Humility this country the way we understand it now we tend to think of humility is solely the purview of somebody very very spiritual yeah or solely the purview of somebody very very passive right the guy who can't take the football and if there's anything we like to do in medicine we like to kick the football right we like to live in the active verb we suture and debride and in size and diagnosed we don't like to think of ourselves receiving and opening up and witnessing so what I'm asking for here is nothing less than a real cultural change than a revolution in the way we think about ourselves and think about humility that in fact humility is powerful humility can help overthrow the most powerful empire in the world right that in fact humility is a necessary adjunct is a necessary partner of action you only have to think of the heart which must feel up with blood before it can pump out again the lungs which must inhale before we can exhale to realize that listening and action are necessary partners in medicine and so back to my original question which was can Teaching Listening listening be taught yes a resounding yes it's what I do every single day I teach listening by having my students read stories like Nancy Meyers who's a memoirist who writes about having MS and using a wheelchair and she says that when she started publishing people started coming out of the woodwork they would send her these emails and letters me too me too she says it's as though the parts we were all singing that we thought were solos turned out to be a chorus only none of us was singing loud enough for the others to hear so we see here that telling and listening become an antidote to isolation a call for community I also teach listening by having my students write their own personal stories their own embodied stories of illness one young woman a medical student who also had MS publish this beautiful essay but she published it ultimately under a pseudonym because she felt like there was such a punishment in medical culture for any sign of weakness right any doctor whose Elliot you can't talk about it and yet at the end of her essay she had the most beautiful advice for her colleagues she said don't stand by the foot of the bed and tower over your patient she feels small already take a minute sit down listen try to understand realize that you'll never understand try anyway narrative humility right realize you'll never understand try anyway and finally I teach listening by having my students actually witnessed stories do oral histories one of the most moving oral histories was here at Sarah Lawrence a student of mine named Marlies Brosnan she asked me to use her name came to me and said scienter view a rel of mine who has late-stage ALS and he can't speak anymore can I interview him I said well how are you gonna engage in this listening exercise with somebody who can't speak she said trust me and I did and it was one of the most moving stories I've ever had the opportunity to witness she showed us this video of her relative Casey who was sitting in his wheelchair with you know his breathing apparatus and all of his accoutrement and she would ask him a question and he would start to answer with his left hand writing it down when he grew tired she would come in and write you know finish writing the sentence and say is that what you meant by God and in this way together together in that relational space they Co constructed his story and so she wrote about it the interaction is central and what he is writing is secondary he is having his say and I am the instrument that is giving voice to his thoughts right what a beautiful model for that relational space in healthcare so finally I just want to say that teaching listening has been the most humbling and moving experience for me over the years bell hooks writes that education can be a practice of freedom education that connects the will to know with the will to become and that learning is a place where paradise can be created and so I'd like to suggest that a healthcare that is practiced from a stance of narrative humility a place that connects the will to know with the will to become that creates a situation such that listening is a place where paradise can be created thank you very much
Saving the world vs kissing the girl,Lindsay Doran,I have this part of the question how many of you know what a spoiler alert okay well let me let me explain them for people to go if you're reading a review of a movie or a book or something and you see the word spoiler it means that the review is about to give away the ending or give away some important plot twists and if you keep reading room so here's my spoiler I'm about to give away the ending of pretty much every movie ever made and so if you haven't seemed pretty much every movie ever made I apologize now because I'm about to ruin it for last summer I was asked to speak at the second world Commerce in the international partners i called her association which makes no sense because I'm not a psychologist I'm a movie producer and as recently as two years ago I'd never even heard of positive psychology but one year ago I read a book called flourish by dr. marcella and in that book he named what he calls the five elements of well-being so I'd like to give those to you now and write them down if you like it's only eight words i'm not a big slide person so it's write them down then later look at them that's as close to a slide as you're going to get out so here they are the five elements of wealthy number one the first three you just heard when I saw him talk number one positive emotions number two engagement number three and then since then that that talk was from 2008 he's adding two more positive relationships and positive accomplishments so to RT Sullivan and his colleagues in positive psychology these are the five elements well being more of these things you have a new lives but more likely you are happy and optimistic and resilient but when I first saw this list not knowing what it was I didn't know it was the five elements of well-being I thought it was the five qualities of a good move I think that positive impressions engagement meaning positive relationships and positive accomplishments and like I've interested in the idea is there a correlation between the five things that make life worth living and the five games that make movies worth watch and since our topic today is together or the word together I thought I would focus just on those last two positive relationships and positive accomplishments because I think when you look at those two elements of well-being through the lens of popular movies you begin to get some sense of how we feel about them and how much we value them and whether we value one over the other so the question becomes this which matters will saving the world or kissing the girl so let's start with positive comments because that's the easy one everybody needs see that there's a relationship between movie and movies and accomplishments we're Americans we love winners we like people who are top the image of somebody jumping up and down at the end of a film celebrating some victory I think as a fairly instinctive and i thought i would write down three examples of movies that ended positive in commons there were thousands to choose from but the three i happen to write down when i was first thinking about this work when Jennifer Grey makes the scary dance leap into packing Swayze's arms at the end of dirty dancing when the karate kid makes the impossible kick that wipes out his opponent and when King George the sixth finally gets through his wartime speech without stammering to me these accomplishments are among the great pleasures of the cinema but then I sat down with a man who runs an audience research from one of those companies that oversees will be brief because I wanted to know you I want to show him that listened to see if he thought there was correlation between the list and movies the preview really well and he looked at the list and in about two seconds he said I can tell you one thing right now audiences don't care a lot of college and I said what and he said audiences don't care about accomplishments what they care about is the moment afterwards when the accomplishment is shared with the person the hero loves so I went I went back to my list and I looked at them and I went Wow dirty dancing doesn't with a leaf it ends with a scene in which jennifer grey reconciles with her father who's the most important person in her life when he says how beautiful she looked while she was dancing and the grunting kid doesn't have a kick if you see the more recent version and you see it over and over again on multiple screens but after that he reconciles with his opponent and then he shares his victory with his mother and his trainer the last thing you see in the king's speech is not the speech it's a car white letters on a black background that says Lionel and birdy remained friends for the rest of their lives Lionel maiden speech therapist and Bertie being the nickname for the key and the movie didn't always end that way it turns out you can forgive them for thinking they were making a movie by speech it's called the King speaking after all and that speech is one of the most important moments in British wartime history but they wanted more than that um and they have those seeds in which he reconciles with his I mean he's not reckon cells but he shares his victory speech therapist with his family but the audience wanted even more than that they want make sure that that friendship that they've been watching develop over the course of that movie was a real friendship it wasn't just a powerful man using another man for his own devices that it was a real friendship and it went on forever so what I began to realize was it in movie turns over and over again positive relationships trumped positive accomplishments almost every time and there's some interesting corollaries to this for example we forget how these movies in a lot of the time and the perfect example is a woman I know whose favorite movie in the whole world is dirty dancing she's probably seen in a hundred and fifty times and she's a studio executive and we can set our watches when we're in meetings with her how long goes by before she'll say you know what this C reminds me um it reminds me of that scene and dirty dancing where Patrick Swayze and then we start to laugh and then she starts to laugh and says what am I supposed to do it's my favorite movie ever so I called her up and I said something what's the last thing that happens in dirty days she said the leap and I said really acting all superior ism um and she said yeah well you know this Jennifer Grey runs down the aisle and she leaps into Patrick Swayze's arms and he holds her up with the air like an airplane and then he put her down then they started to dance and then the movies oh and i said when does she reconcile with her father she said well before me so I came over and whatever to her office and I brought the film with me and I show her the last 10 minutes of the movie and she couldn't believe it and what we realized was all this emotion that comes from the end of that movie that we were associating would that leave a week she was afraid to make a beginning of the movie it now has the courage to make at the end of the movie it wasn't coming from the account it was coming from the relationship and the other thing that's interesting is that when we make movies for men and boys when we make movies for general audiences which a lot of time is men and there's a structure that occurs again and again and again not living but in a lot of those movies and here's the years how it works there's the hero who's usually a man there's the accomplishment the goal that he has set himself to accomplish and then there's the relationship you get the accomplished whenever relationship because there's a primary relationship with a woman or his father or a child or with the best friend so here's how it goes he sets himself towards this relationship I mean the towards this accomplishment and he works really hard to get there and it's all kinds of obstacles he has to overcome and then there's a terrible set of actors before the end and then he gets there any cheese's achievement and then he realizes it doesn't mean anything without the relationship and then there's a scene about the relationship okay when we make movies for women not all the time much of the time the accomplishment is the goal is love and everything that's going on in the movie is about whether those two people that the movie is about get together at the end or not and it doesn't matter if it's the notebook or Notting Hill or bridesmaids or the bow that's what's going on now some people say that's patronizing to women and some people say that's sending two women and some people say that's Hollywood's way of keeping women in their place but maybe what it really means figured it out women don't need a whole movie to teach them then relationships are more bars of an accomplishments they knew that when they buy their ticket so you've been just dispense with all that saving the world stuff because they want to get right to the good stuff and the good stuff it's the relationship now by this point I got to know more yourself and I called him up and I said tell me something if you put that list five elements well being in front of men and women do they react to it differently and he said yeah in general men will tell you that accomplishments are the most important thing and women will tell you it's relationships okay but think about this we tried really hard in a movie business to end our movies at the moment of peak audience satisfaction so if men really value accomplishments more than relationships wouldn't we end missile bounces off the Transamerica building instead of with a senior four people at a table wouldn't we end Transformers Dark of the Moon when the Autobots defeat the Decepticons instead of a scene where the guy says to the girl you're the only thing in this world that I need wouldn't we end the final harry potter movie when harry pills baltimore you've been trying to kill baltimore for seven volts and eight and if you look at the trailer for that last harry potter movie you'd swear that's the only thing going on in the movie is whether or not he's going to kill voldemort but the end the movie where he kills baltimore no we ended years later when he's grown up at a train station with his wife and his children as friends so maybe what's going on here when we make movies for men and boys is a giant bait and switch we say here's a moan about saving the world here's a movie about a giant alien robots here's a movie about killing the evil wizard but what we deliver is a movie about really man and women the acknowledgment so you can't really talk about accomplishments and relationships and movies without talking about rocky when I give this talk in smaller groups inevitably by this point someone will have interrupted me and said what about Ravi what about Robbie everything you're talking about is rocky there's the accomplishment and there's a relationship he's an accomplishment that he shares with somebody looks he wins the fight that he says yo Adrian I did it so let's talk about rounds when I was in Philadelphia last summer I had the chance to visit the famous rocky steps the ones that he runs up in and keep in mind this was during that terrible heat wave they were having a summer the heat index that particular day in Philadelphia was a hundred and fifteen degrees and there were doctors on radio and on television banging people not to go outside let's say literally if you go outside and exercise today you will die so I took a taxi to the top of the rocky steps and I walked out on it is the Philadelphia Museum of Art and I walked out onto the top and every five minutes there was somebody running the staff some wool 72 of them bottom to top getting to the top turning around jumping up down pumping their fists there picture taken and I began to realize that there was more one on there than just tourism because I would see people with tears pouring down their faces as they were running those steps and it turns out there's a wonderful quote called Rocky stories in which a journalist interview people who ran the steps he spent a year interviewing those people and there's wonderful photographs and what he found was that people were coming from all over the world to celebrate some personal victory by imitating Rockies so for example if you look at the book you'll see there's two women who've been friends for 45 years or jumping up and down the top of the rocket steps to celebrate that long friendship and there's a man's had a heart transplant who's come all the way to Philadelphia to run the steps to celebrate his recovery and then we employ will say if I could just get that girl to marry me I marry her on top of the rocky steps the day I was there three different weddings were waiting to go on at the same time hot tuxedos hot bridal gowns hot bridesmaids dresses and the thing is that movie came out 36 years ago and none of those people was older than 36 so it just shows you the power of the inspiration of that movie and how long it's lasted so rocky as most of you probably know is the story of a washed-up boxer who ends up going 15 rounds against the world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed it won the Academy Award for Best Picture it was a huge financial heads it's on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest American movies ever made it's actually number four on their list of the most of inspirational American movies ever made it has spawned five sequels so far and hundreds of imitators and almost every single one with sequels and imitators has copied that rocky formula that formula of the underdog who wins right down to the smallest detail except and the one but they almost never come is the fact that rocky didn't win original Rocky McPhee rocky doesn't win he doesn't say yo Adrian I did it because he didn't do it he says at the end of rocky to where he doesn't in the fight and then he wins the fight rocky 3 and rocky for rocky five but in that first Rocky movie the one that's number four on the American Film Institute's leather the most inspirational movies ever made rocky loses the fight talk about a movie what people don't remember how it ends talk about a movie where this power of a relationship overwhelms people's memory of everything that happened before them but I got interested in that list of the most inspirational movies ever made because what I began to notice is how many of those movies are about heroes who don't win how many of them don't get what they want for example give you some other examples from their top 10 inspiration George Bailey in its wonderful life all he wants is to travel the world adding this Finch in to kill a mockingbird has a client who's been falsely accused of a terrible crime and while he wants is for that man to be set free lil Elliot wants et to be his friend forever the Joad family and its in the grace of rather come to California seeking prosperity and none of them get what they want so what gives if there's no positive accomplished at the end of those movies and no victory to be celebrated afterwards then what makes these movies so inspiration why are people still jumping up and down on the rocky steps 36 years later if rocky lost a fight and I think the answer is that what's being celebrated at the ends of those movies is something else and it's not as enormous as saving the world and it's not quite as simple as kissing the girl what's being celebrated at the ends of those movies is the tenderness and the kindness and the comfort of each other at the end of It's a Wonderful Life when George Bailey has returned from the death of despair the angel says to him no man is a failure who has friends at the end of et when Elliott is heartbroken by the spaceship karcher we know he'll be comforted by the family that surrounds him at the end of tequila Mockingbird when a series of terrible events have been succeeded by a series of beautiful Atticus Finch his little daughter sums it all up by talking about the neighbors she says who bring food with death and flowers with sickness and the little things in between and at the end of the first rocky movie he doesn't say yo Adrian I did it and he doesn't even kiss her he just clutches her with all the strength he has left in his body while they say i love you over and over again you
Creativity as a life skill,Gerard Puccio,"imagine we've all been endowed with this gift of imagination and I'm going to ask you to use your imagination to picture in your mind's eye a tiger I'm gonna give you a little help Tigers have colorful stripes for camouflage on average Tigers grow to about 11 feet weighing more than 600 pounds of all cats that exist in the world today they have the longest canine teeth about two and a half inches long now I'd like you to imagine that you've just come face-to-face with a very unhappy tiger what do you do are you fast enough to outrun the tiger I doubt it very much are you strong enough to out wrestle the tiger I doubt that - why did I ask you to think about a tiger well it could be because I teach at Buffalo State and Buffalo State College our mascot happens to be a Bengal tiger but that's not it I could tell you that one of the most enjoyable Reed's I've had in the last year was the Life of Pi which has been released as a major motion picture and if you are familiar with that then you know one of the characters in the book is a tiger but that's not it Tigers first appeared two million years ago the homogeneous humans appeared two and a half million years ago think about it look at yourself how on earth did we ever survive given threats like that in our environment how is that possible here's one answer conformity psychological research done in the 1950s and 60s shows that humans have what's called a conformity bias we tend to do what other people do it's the way we're wired I'll give you a visual demonstration of that a YouTube video of an old TV program many of you probably won't remember it I remember from my childhood called candid camera the hidden camera if you're familiar with like disaster date MTV it's kind of like the precursor to disaster date so in this scene from candid camera there are three actors on an elevator facing the back of the elevator and then a fourth person comes in who unknowingly is being videoed he's not part of the program let's see what happens I would try it once again here's the candid subject it comes the candid camera staff three of them at least and this man has apparently been in Group [Music] [Applause] so it makes you wonder when you see something like that how on earth did we survive well there's an evolutionary advantage to conformity in fact there are three the first is conformity allows for collaboration you want to take down a great big woolly mammoth get some friends it also helps in aiding with learning by observing others we can see them test ideas and then we take what's successful and we use those are elves and the third is it creates culture we have shared values and norms but if all we ever did was conform then we wouldn't have growth we would never try anything new let me try this out with you physical analogy if you're holding something sharp please put it down and fold your arms in front of you as you would naturally note which forearm you have on top I have my left forearm on top when I asked you to put your arms together how did that feel comfortable right did you have to think about it probably not take your arms up this time and weave them together so the opposite forearm ends up on top some of you're trying to figure it out same arms the first time you folded your arms that's what conformity feels like it's comfortable and you don't have to think you just follow but if that's all you ever did you would never grow eventually because conditions change we have to try new things conformity has been talked about in terms of its role in evolution but I want to suggest to you today that there's another part of that equation and that's creativity so while conformity is necessary for evolution I would suggest that it's not sufficient that it also requires creativity and let me see if I can make a case by looking at human history and it's probably likely that the seeds for creativity began even before humans emerged in Africa probably with our ancestors who used sticks for tools but let's stick with human history the first tool invented created manufactured by humans Homo habilis occurred 2.5 million years ago it's called the flake tool it was a rock that was sharpened at one edge that could be used for splitting nuts and fruit that lasted almost 1.4 million years now if all we ever did was conform we'd still be using that tool today but something happened someone imagined another possibility and that led to an innovation in stone tools called the hand axe it's a symmetrical tool that can be held easily in the palm of the hand which made striking much easier that lasted about 600,000 years and then something interesting happened about 40,000 years ago there was something archaeologists call the creative explosion in Africa Homo sapiens emerged the anatomically modern human Homo sapiens took imagination and went beyond functional use of imagination and they applied it to diverse areas for example at this time we went from thrusting weapons which means you have to be close to your prey to throwing weapons body decorations emerged art emerged for the first time cave paintings burial rituals the production of clothing purpose-built shelter and so forth what I suggest to you as a result of this human history demonstrates that you were born to be creative it's a natural part of who you are but it doesn't have to stop there we don't have to wait for our creativity to occur to magically appear what we know through research is that you can take what's innate and you can develop it further we can engage in what's called deliberate creativity creativity is like any other skill like all abilities what does that mean we all have it you've been born with it we're not all the same so we vary in the degree of craveability that we have but what we know is that through deliberate practice through training and through learning you can enhance your creative thinking in fact that's the reason why we exist at Buffalo State the founding faculty members of our department conducted an empirical study students who went through a creativity course when compared to a control group showed significant cognitive gains so what is this creative cognition what is this innate set of thinking skills that we're all born with the two skills that we're all born with is an ability to engage in divert in thinking and convergent thinking and some scholars believe about 40,000 years ago one of the reasons why we had a creative explosion is that the mind developed evolved in such a way that Homo sapiens could begin to control their thinking and they could shift that's called contextual focus they could shift from divergent to converge and thinking divergent thinking is the ability to generate many varied and original options it's the creation of variation convergent thinking is the selection development of the most promising options now isn't an interesting sounds a lot like evolution doesn't it were the two fundamental properties of evolution the creation of variation and the selective retention of those novel variations which enhance the ability to survive so the same thought process seems to parallel the process of evolution this is what we all have innately but although we have this innate skill we don't often use this skill this gift if you will to the best of our ability so let me talk a little bit about deliberate creativity so we can all engage in divergent thinking we can all engage in converse and thinking what often happens well we have an idea this novel idea sometimes the next thought that enters our mind is what a reason why it won't work it's too risky so and so will criticize me here's another example that may make it easier to to recognize this ineffective thought process imagine a meeting someone's called a meeting there's a problem that has to be solved the person who called the meeting says right we've got this tuffnut of a problem anybody have any ideas someone shares an idea what's often the next comment in that meeting yeah I won't work we don't have the budget for it that's crazy how about this one we've tried that before what happens to the creativity they get sucked out of the room right and what happens is we stick with the tried and true this area of familiarity really not that divergent in our thought process we conform to what's known so although we have this innate skill sometimes we don't use it effectively can we deliberately enhance this skill of creative thinking well two tips for you first of all learn how to suspend your judgment to defer judgment how often have you quickly criticized an idea only to find out later it really worked if you move quickly to convergence to judge fast you may limit your ability to see new possibilities second tip go for quantity this is well documented Dean Simonton creativity researcher who looked at eminently creative people found that one of the main differences between eminently creative people and ordinarily people like myself is that eminently creative people generate many more ideas Picasso had 20,000 works of art Shakespeare wrote 154 sonnets 37 plays Edison George Washington Carver well-known inventors had many invention ideas of which a few revolutionized the world I learned recently by listening to NPR that Hemingway wrote 40 different endings to his book for Whom the Bell Tolls before he chose which one to go with line is Paul Linus Pauling the Nobel laureate said it best the best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas so if you want to be deliberately more creative take advantage of what nature has given you learn to suspend your judgment don't jump to conclusions too quickly and learn to generate many ideas why is this important historically hopefully I've made the case for how creativity has been part of our evolution but that's historically I would say today creativity and creative problem-solving has never been more important the Flake tool that I shared with you earlier lasted for how long one point four million years today manufactured products go through fundamental redesign every five to ten years in the area of technology it's every six to twelve months we can't afford to wait a million years for the next good idea right we can't afford to wait for the creativity news to give us the breakthrough we have to find ways to be deliberately creative to accelerate what nature and evolution has given us a global study completed recently in fact this year by Adobe conducted around the world 80% of those who were surveyed said that creativity is important to economic growth when asked about their own creativity one out of four surveyed one out of four said that they were living up to their creative potential when asked about their creativity experiences especially their educational experiences 59% said that school stifled their creativity and the us because we like to lead the world the number was higher it was 62% so what's happening here's one reason for why schools stifle creativity this comes from Mark Ronco a creativity researcher he says that most educational experiences or most educational efforts focus on convergent thinking remember divergent and convergent thinking finding the single right answer wouldn't it be nice if life was that simple if every problem we came up to had only one single right answer but it's not and he says therefore these educational experiences may do very little if anything for creative potential I would go a little further and suggest that in an era of standardization and accountability in schools perhaps what we're teaching children to do is to be good conformist instead of teaching them how to be independent thinkers well let's make this a little more personal how about you and your creativity think about the degree to which you balance conformity and creativity in your own lives do you engage in flexible thinking do you engage in flexible behavior do you try new things are you open minded you may never I hope have to wrestle a tiger but life is complex and I am sure you will have to wrestle with tenacious problems JP Guilford one of the pioneers in the field of creativity said to live is to have problems and to solve problems is to grow creatively remember evolution may not have made you particularly strong or particularly fast but evolution has given you the gift of a creative mind if you deliberately use it if you deliberately develop it I guarantee you you will be more successful in dealing with life's complexities thank you"
The transformative power of gratitude,Katia Sol,I'm feeling really grateful to be here sharing this conference with you today grateful to have the opportunity to present grateful to have some friends in the audience friendly faces grateful for M drone Studios this amazing creative space in the city all the Innovative things that are happening here the Fantastic production team just feel really grateful to be alive as a deal really um beautifully introduced I work with the cult of leadership program at the regenerative design Institute in bolinus um this program was founded by James Stark and Christopher kunch and like to give a little shout out to them there James is in India right now giving a tedx talk flew all the way around the world and so it's pretty cool that I'm doing this here and Christopher is at the Northern California per permaculture convergence so it's just amazing how these seeds are going out all over the world and what we specialize in is inner permaculture so RDI has a bunch of programs that are doing the kinds of things you've heard about today learning about gray water systems and permaculture design and reskilling and you know all the different practices that were hearing on the outer level but what we look like to look at is what happens if we look take a look at our inner Garden so what are the shifts that need to happen on an inner level that then will create the possibility for transformation on an outer level that we really want to see in our own lives in our communities and in the world so my presentation today I'm going to focus on what we call um a deceptively simple but profoundly transformative practice which is gratitude now I'd like you to just imagine for a moment what would it be like to live in a city founded upon the principle of gratitude what it would be it'd be like if you woke up in the morning and the first thought that came to your mind was wow I'm just so grateful to have another day to be alive what would it be like if as you left the house in the morning first person that you ran into maybe it's your bus driver maybe it's the Barista the local coffee shop you're like wow I'm so grateful for you I just love the way that you make those little designs on my coffee makes me really happy every morning imagine as if we went to the workplace and you talked to your colleagues and you express your gratitude you know just take that extra moment to be like you know I really am grateful for the work that you're doing really grateful to work at this company really grateful to your employees your employer get home from the work at the end of a long day and express your gratitude to your spouse your partner your housemate go to bed at night with this feeling of gratitude what would it be like if we lived in a city founded upon gratitude now some might say that we actually do live in a culture that is based on gratitude so the First Nations or indigenous peoples of this land which I've had the fortune of working with around the world practice Thanksgiving on a regular basis and there's something called the Thanksgiving address um this is a poster of it that I have in my home and it talks about all the different aspects of creation that we're grateful for you know ranging from the Earth to the waters to the fish to the trees the plants the Sun the moon and so as we Ponder this you know idea of dwelling in gratitude I'd like you to just close your eyes for a moment and connect to something you're feeling grateful for and I'm going to share a little song um it's a gratitude song I say thank you oh I say thank you oh great spirit in this way I long to give my life to you in love and devotion in love and devotion so just let that little bit of gratitude sink in hold on to it maybe when we're done you can share it with your neighbor the person sitting next to you and I'm going to take you on a little journey into how gratitude became a really central part of my life I was living in Canada in the midst of a very snowy winter 2007 there was just feet and feet of snow and I was going through a really really hard time in my life you know so I was somebody who actually had had a pretty easeful life up until that point in time you know things seemed to come easily to me it wasn't really um I hadn't found myself in a moment of Deep challenge but there it was you know I had a relationship that was falling apart I had a young baby year old I was starting a PhD program I was in a new city where I didn't know anybody and suddenly I found myself having trouble just even getting out of bed in the morning so every day I would wake up and I would have to struggle to find you know like what is the reason to get out of bed what is it that can really help me get through the day and as I would get out of bed I would get dressed and get my laptop get ready to go to school get my snow gear on my jacket and my T and get ready my snow boots get ready to trudge out into the wintry coal I would root in the practice of gratitude so I found that if I just dug deep and found the one thing that I was grateful for I could make it I could make it to the subway if I just focused on I'm really grateful for my legs that can walk you know there's lots of people around the world who actually don't have that privilege I'm really grateful for my breath just the ability to breathe in and out I'm grateful for my eyes that can see grateful to have arms that can hold my baby you know I'm just grateful and it was that practice that really got me through those really dark and deep days and you know even though I'd worked with indigenous cultures around the world and even though I'd been exposed to this on some level I'd like to think that you know I just kind of came to it as a it's almost like it saved my life you know it was just rooting in that gratitude that got me through that time fast forward a couple of years um and I came out to California and encountered the encountered the Ecology of leadership program and I was really stunned to find that gratitude was a regular part of what they were practicing in the program so as I began my meetings with my co-workers we would start every single meeting with gratitude you know imagine that you know you've got an hourlong meeting to take the first 10 minutes and just talk about what you're grateful for I was kind of like whoa this is revolutionary you know but we would just go around and around and it wasn't just one thing you know it was like hearing like 10 20 30 things that each person was feeling grateful for and it really changed my mind in terms of what was possible in an organizational culture and then as we started to I was doing my PhD research on the program and its transformative impacts I got to see in a circle of people what became possible as um you created a culture of gratitude so every weekend when the group gathered everybody would sit down and think you know what is something that everyone in the circle is feeling grateful for and through it through my actual Expos exposure to the program I began my own daily gratitude practice in a much more formal way um so I committed about a year ago to do a daily gratitude practice online on Facebook where I would post it on a daily basis and kind of tell the world what I was grateful for and for me that was a way of really rooting into um a commitment these are just some of the pictures of things I was grateful for throughout the year um and what I found was that the more that I looked for something that I was grateful for the more that every day would find more and more things and so it became the self-reinforcing practice where I couldn't just find one thing that I was grateful for I would find more and more you know there the smell of the Roses as I'm walking down the street and the Jasmine wafting over me and the beauty of this is my son helping me with the dishes um you know everywhere I looked I would just find things to be grateful for that's me feeling really grateful um outside of Cafe Gratitude in fact so what so so special about gratitude why is it that I mean this seemingly simple technology is so powerful now I'd like to say that there's actual correlation between things like permaculture and gratitude in that you know both of these are actually not really new technologies you know like it's not surprising you can you've heard of gratitude before but uh like with permaculture we like to say that we're on The Cutting Edge of a thousand-year-old technology I think with gratitude it's kind of the same so this is an age-old thing but what would it be like if we really brought this to life in our cities and cultures and families and homes and organizations today now some of the principles of gratitude uh it's an affirmation of life itself so it's like just that waking up in the morning to be like I'm thankful for another day like to me that's the most um honest and humble prayer that we can offer on a daily basis it shifts our Focus from what's negative to what's positive so it's so easy in our culture to be critical or judging or always looking for what's wrong what's not right analyzing um whereas gratitude just shifts the focus just a little bit right to find what it is that is actually positive it's an opportunity for reframing so it gives us this new lens on life so even when something's really hard to focus on it the perspective of gratitude means to find what's right so I'm really grateful actually that I got sick because I get this opportunity to rest and reflect and stay home and um you know curl up under the blankets and it's like finding what's good about even the hard situations and ultimately for me it connects me to something that's bigger than myself so it takes me out of my own self referential world into really opening to something bigger Brother D David um is a monk who's created an organization gratefulness.org I love this quote he says in daily life we must see that it is not happiness that makes us grateful but gratefulness that makes us happy it's a lot of recent studies about what the impacts of gratitude are on personal happiness and health and again it's like this is not revolutionary but actually it could be for our personal well-being and um health no regular gratitude practice that could be like just making a list of what you're grateful for on a daily basis or a weekly basis um contributes toward progress toward important person personal goals greater alertness enthusiasm determination attentiveness and energy Better Health sleep duration Sleep Quality greater energy optimism and positivity and a sense of feeling connected to others the greater good Center at UC Berkeley is doing a new study on gratitude it'll be really interesting to see what they come up with so quote this ISS the moment that you shift your mindset from this perspective of negativity and judgment to one of appreciation look at what happens to our bodies so your brain function becomes more balanced harmonized and supple your heart begins to pump in a much more coherent and harmonious Rhythm and biochemical changes trigger a host of helpful responses throughout your body There's an actual science to this it's like M mindfulness meditation um gratitude has the same impact on your body and your brain and your heart studies of relationships and marriage um the Gman Institute out of Washington they say that the number one predictor of success in marriage is the level of gratitude so if you have at least a ratio five appreciations for every one negative comment or criticism then you'll make it seriously so he said that they can predict with 90% accuracy the success of a couple after watching them for three minutes based on this interaction Alone um which is pretty revolutionary like we kind of think should be 50/50 right like at least as much positive as the negative but actually we need to up our gratitude and appreciation of one another um five times in order just to make it and our family my son Mato um and I practice gratitude with my children and it's really amazing what they're capable of um even from a young age so my four-year-old has a much easier time with it than a seven-year-old and we'll do rounds of gratitude like on the way to school in the morning or as we're getting ready to have dinner at night um we'll just talk about what we're grateful for and Matteo will go on and on sometimes for a half an hour straight of all the things he's grateful for and he um he actually comes up with his own rules he says mom these are the rules for being great I'm like what's that and he says well if you say God or ice cream you get to go twice gratitude in our organizations so this is from Cafe Gratitude of course which is an innovator right here in San Francisco about creating this kind of culture um there's also jiv which is a local hotel company which has implemented gratitude into the organization and similarly um chip Conley the head of Jad he said that if you just have two practices of gratefulness a day in organization it can shift the entire culture so he committed personally as a CEO just to tell two people in the company that he was grateful on a daily basis and it completely shifted the organizational culture so if all this is true then why don't we practice gratitude why don't we do it um maybe it's just deceptively simple we think this is you know that's kind of a low-level kindergarten sort of thing gratitude we don't really need to do that maybe we're afraid of putting ourselves out there so like you know maybe it would feel kind of vulnerable to go up to the very in the morning be like wow I just really love that design on my coffee you know like maybe that feels like it's taking a step outside of our comfort zone that would be um maybe a bit risky courageous we make assumptions we think people already know so like do you think to thank your spouse or partner for making the bed in the morning or you know cleaning up after they have a meal you know like we just take that for granted and we think well they're supposed to do that so I don't need to tell them I'm grateful and we're also coming from these old world values of um individualism ins stinginess competition and so we're constantly thinking well why would I put myself out there when they're not telling me that they're grateful for me first right instead of creating this culture of generosity and giving it Forward just leave you with some simple keys for if you want to incorporate gratitude in your life um some things that can really help be it whether you want to change your own personal life or a relationship or your organization or your community um number one is just to commit so for me the practice of saying I'm going to do this on a daily basis and I'm going to put it out there on Facebook was really powerful but you can um commit just in your own personal way but just the practice of saying I'm going to do this or like for chip connley to say I'm going to give gratitude twice a day at my work um that was transformative in and of itself be real so you know it doesn't really work if you're expressing gratitude but you're actually not really feeling it has to really come from that place of feeling true and being something you genuinely notice that you're grateful for even if it's just as simple as your breath number three what you appreciate appreciates and so what I've noticed is that the more you notice what you're grateful for the more things you see that you're grateful for so you're able to actually cultivate that kind of Beauty in your life so if you want to see more you know if I want to see my kids doing the dishes more the more I tell them I'm grateful for it the more they're going to do it four is to do it together so it's actually really helpful to get on board with this with like your partner or your children or your organization so that you hold one another accountable because sometimes I'm not feeling that grateful so it really helps me if then my kids say hey Mom you know we really should do gratitude before dinner then we can do that together and the fifth principle this is kind of a magic secret of gratitude which is that it's possible to give thanks not just for what you see and what you already have but for what's yet to come so if you really want to experience more joy and love in your life or you really want to um you know live in a beautiful home in nature to give gratitude for that as if it's already happened and there's a secal principle of that in which gratitude actually becomes a creative act and you draw that thing to you by giving that thanks and it's like that total confidence of like yes I'm so grateful that that thing already happened um and in my experience it really works so back to gratitude in City 2.0 I'd like to suggest that gratitude is actually the fertilizer that could really cultivate the kinds of cities that we want to live in a resilient regenerative Community you know just thinking back to you like what it would feel like to live in a city where this culture of appreciation and love was really pervasive where when you're walking down the street you have this feeling of just connection that sometimes feels really hard to attain in the city but I know that like for me this morning I had done my gratitude practice as I was driving down the hill and then I stopped to get a coffee and I was walking down the street and because I was feeling really grateful then I was smiling at all these people and they were smiling back at me and it was like just by my practicing the Gratitude than I was able to feel like I lived in a city that was a culture of gratitude so as I close I'd like to invite just to a little experiment um which is that you might try this out so as you leave here today maybe as we go into the networking portion at the end of the day just consider finding one thing you're grateful for and telling somebody see what happens maybe you go home and you find your beloved or um housemate at your house and you think to share something you're grateful for with that person see what happens and uh my information's up there you can be in touch let me know how it went for you um see what becomes possible if we really take responsibility for creating regenerative communities from the inside out thank you
From cult to courage,Linda Murphrey,"early in my life I learned that there was one thing that could kill a festive mood at a dinner party and that was to talk about me to talk about my life my life as the daughter of a cult leader there was very little that was joking or light-hearted about the first 28 years of my life so I avoided that topic at all costs it was too painful nobody could understand so I became a master at diverting attention at during the conversation on to somebody else but not me I so rarely talked about my life that on the rare occasion when I would slip and somebody would kind of push for me to divulge I couldn't just casually and comfortably share it I would bond with the story and it would go something like this well I grew up outside of Chicago and my dad pastored actually a wonderful Church there that through the years evolved into a 15,000 member cult it operated and it still operates under the guise of an independent fundamental Baptist Church but those who have left the followers have tried to leave Outsiders even the media it was on 20/20 last year recognize that it's clearly a cult every member was in complete obedience father they didn't dare disagree or be disloyal for fear of being publicly ridiculed or punished or banished for doing so they didn't go on a vacation without asking my dad's permission and he had said they drink the kool-aid I'm not kidding they would have my dad lived a double life one of righteous family man and dynamic speaker in the public eye but one of sordid sexual secrets privately secrets that only my siblings and me and my mom knew he hated my mom hated her treated her terribly abused her and even turned his own children against our mother we hated her he told us she was crazy we thought to make him happy we'd hate her too our home was felt full of turmoil hatred stress strife and as a little girl it was isolating it was intense and it was frightening he had affairs had a mistress for many years the wife of a sunday-school teacher built her family a beautiful home right around the corner from our house you could see their family from our back door it was it was craziness living one way preaching another my brother my older brother he became another version of my father he took a he pastored a church in Texas was found to have been having affairs with 14 different women divorced that current wife married one of the 14 my father tried desperately to cover it up moved into another church where he was found to have had 17 there was with different women and he just recreated what he had seen my dad with and my dad did nothing but cover it up I felt like I had one main responsibility as a child it was simple but daunting and that was to keep all the secrets there were so many you see he had taught us that the best way to please God was to please him because he was God's man and he taught us that to please him we had to keep all the secrets we couldn't even tell our best friends what went on in our home because we might be the causes for the destruction of his ministry I literally feared my very life if I ever talked about my dad's ministry but what went on in our home for fear that it would hurt his ministry I was so afraid and the greater the secrets the greater the fear and the greed of my determination to keep quiet I gotta tell you the money part of it was pretty nice as a kid I mean think about it tithes and offerings from 50,000 people know it created a lavish lifestyle for our family my father owned most of the city where the church was he owned to college to high schools to great schools a cemetery blocks of buildings he was very wealthy and even into our adult years he owned us he owned our homes our cars our furniture he owned our lives and we didn't dare cross him because we were to her whose everything he died a multi-millionaire he left nothing to his children he left everything to the organization which my younger sister and her husband now need and they still perpetuate his legacy the strict rules the undying loyalty and they still try to keep all the secrets I never understood why was I the only one that the four kids so tortured by the hypocrisy so disturbed by the mind control over thousands and thousands of people and so determined to find a better life why was I the only one that insisted on answers to my questions and why was I the only one that ultimately broke away and cut ties with the brainwashing the oppression the fear the secrets and the life that had never been my life I finally walked away when I was about 28 years of age then being estranged from my entire family and I did not see my family again until many years later at my dad's funeral okay see what I mean not a story to share at a dinner party I really got to the point after I left dinner that I couldn't talk about me for one thing who would understand for another thing it was too hard it hurt too bad so I made a mental note and permanent marker that said must never talk about my life and for many years I didn't I couldn't however wonderful things had happened through the years since their therapy a lot of therapy deprogramming freedom from the mind control and I began to heal and learn and accept and forgive and even learn to be thankful that bizarre life that I had because I realized I was learning some amazing lessons from not only being there but from having the guts to leave and I now have values that are deeply carved in my very soul from that instead of these you don't get for reading a book or from a workshop or another person bellies that are only this deeply ingrained when you live what I live because my dad was a cult leader I now embrace three values and no one will ever take these away from me the first one is freedom to explore my own interests freedom to live within my own value system freedom to determine my own value system freedom to believe what I believe and never stifle what I believe freedom to disagree for you to ask questions and require honest answers freedom to learn Who I am and freedom to love Who I am the second value was truth I learned pretty quickly that I wasn't going to be very free until I dealt with what was true and that was hard for me truth was a scary word for me because I mean my entire life I had never been allowed to speak of what went on in our home I had never told even my best friends what went on in our house being truthful was one of the scariest things I could think of I learned that secrets grown in the dark but when exposed to the light of truth they start to lose their power Mary Vernon my dear amazing therapist in Dallas Texas who nurtured me and who loved me through years and years of healing she used to say to me Linda you're only as sick as your secrets you are only as sick as your secrets so I stopped keeping secrets and as scared as I was in my late 20s I finally began to deal with what was true I think it finally began to speak what was true and eventually learned how to live openly only in truth and the third value is courage did you know that you actually can't have freedom or truth if you have no courage is a requirement for both you may desire to live in complete free and the complete truth but if you're lacking and courage you will live in neither one in my late 20s I had a tiny shred of courage not much but it was all I needed because my desire to live and be free and honest was somewhat great but that teeny shred of courage that I had was enough to allow me to walk away I have a plaque on my desk that I have had for years and it's gone with me everywhere I've ever moved it says the secret to happiness is freedom and the secrets of freedom is courage and that resonated with me I knew it wasn't going to be happy unless I was free but I knew I wasn't going to be free my second some courage to get out of there I had to cling to and act upon that tiny shred of courage in order to finally leave a cult the only friends I never know my childhood connections my history my family knowing that in doing so I finally have what I had longed for my entire life and that was freedom true freedom truth courage three words that maybe kind of trite and overused to some people to me they are the air that I breathe values upon which I insist on living and loving in my life oh and one other thing I actually know about you sharing my story talking about me I now recognize that it's in sharing my story and I can so passionately share with you my values gained over 28 years not an emotional prison that kept my heart under lock and key and kept my mind for knowing what I knew you know I sometimes wonder if perhaps living in the absence of our values is what can most clearly determine what indeed our values are and for me I really believe that the apps and the denial of created the presence of for so many years I was denied freedom truth and courage and now I will never let them go not to worry you're still not going to find me at a dinner party he's talking about my childhood not going to happen you won't find me sitting around elaborating over my father who took a wonderful church and turn it into a fifty thousand member cult I still know that's a mood killer I get it but you will find me here and in other appropriate settings especially if I can help somebody talking about my life with sincere gratitude for all that I've learned in spite of and because of living in the absence of freedom truth and courage and thank God I now have by now you"
Igniting creativity to transform corporate culture,Catherine Courage,"if I was to ask you what is CEOs view as the most crucial factor for business success what would you say some of you might think business rigor perhaps vision maybe even manager discipline but you'd be mistaken according to a study by IBM the number one factor identified for business success believe it or not is creativity but we have a problem these leaders say that creativity is core to business success however they're unknowingly choking it out of the business environment so how do we bridge this gap as a design leader in Silicon Valley for a dozen years I've been spending some time thinking about this problem and I believe we have a fundamental misunderstanding of creativity we need to start by rejecting the notion that creativity belongs to a select few that it's owned by the creative right brain thinkers the painters the playwrights the poets and that it's unavailable to the more logical left brain thinkers the mathematicians computer scientists engineers I'm here to tell you today we all have the capacity for creative thinking in fact creativity is a birthright available to all but used by few once we come to accept and acknowledge the fact that we can all be creative thinkers we can focus on its development so how do we ignite How do we ignite creativity the answer is in our past Picasso once said every child is an artist the problem is staying an artist when you grow up I'd like to invite you all to take a moment step back to your childhood we questioned the world we were curious about everything and we were naturally observant did you know How do we change the average preschooler asked 100 questions a day we can draw a lot of inspiration about creativity our childhood it starts by opening our minds looking for new possibilities and challenging the status quo just like parents foster creativity and their children we must do the same in the workplace so how do we change I'd like to share three strategies three strategies I believe everyone in this room can use to bring creativity to their workplace let's start by talking Environments about environments are the foundation for creative thinking if you look at most business environments today this is what they look like not very inspiring boring bland rows of cubes equally boring and uninspiring meeting rooms and the tools that we use generic computers wine notebooks black pins one of the core aspects of creative thinking is ideation exploring a variety of ideas collaborating and these kinds of spaces and tools just don't foster that behavior but think back to your childhood these are the kinds of spaces you've worked and played in a variety of different locations for different kinds of activities bold bright colorful energetic and the tools we used blank paper colored pencils pens paint markers everything we needed for imagination and creation the good news companies are catching on and they're recognizing the importance of the environment Microsoft Google Lego just to name a few are investing in spaces like these they're getting the importance of creating a variety of spaces for employees at Citrix where I work we opened a design collaboration space inspired by the design school at Stanford it's 2,000 square feet of wide open space filled with whiteboards tables fools it's easily configurable so you can create any kind of unique working environment creative supplies are everywhere at your fingertips the room is available at all times designed for spontaneous collaboration a radical change happened when we open this space it was pretty incredible instead of preaching about the merits of collaboration and ideation we started seeing it happen real time every day and even better employees are telling us they love this new way of working and they are coming up with better ideas that are impacting our products environment is the foundation for creative thinking a Experiments second way that we can all ignite creativity in our workplace is through experiments but the problem we have is we are so laser focused on execution on process on efficiency that we're missing the opportunity for innovation we create cultures where we are afraid to fail and as a result we do the same thing again and again and again because it's what we know and it feels safe but we aren't able to innovate by repeating the same thing we get trapped in this cycle of micro improvements of incremental ism and missing out on that great opportunity for creative innovation go back to your childhood there was no one way to build a tower of blocks or to make a fantastic creation from play-doh to build a snowman after a snowfall and if we failed it was okay it was part of the process we need to bring this mindset back to the workplace Thomas Edison made a thousand Prototyping unsuccessful attempts before inventing the light bulb but he saw this as part of the process he said the light bulb was an invention with a thousand step we need to embrace this mindset of experimenting we need to learn to fail fast and fail early we need to take our ideas and improve them and iterate them this is how ideas go from good to spectacular a really great way to do this is through prototypes are models created cheaply and quickly using everyday items you can take these prototypes and you can show them to customers you can explore a broad array of ideas with prototypes throw away the ones that don't work and continue to refine the ones that do it's the best way to experiment and fail fast fail early a really famous example of prototyping comes from IDEO a design agency in Silicon Valley they used this prototype made from a marker a film canister and a clothespin and they brought it to surgeons this prototype resonated so well with the surgeons that they were able to come up with a whole host of ideas of how to improve this surgical device and bring it to life idea was able to use this great information and feedback to refine the idea and ultimately generate a real surgical device that tripled the clients revenue in this product space so although experimenting and prototyping may in some way seem like child's play it's actually driving real innovation and business success a third Storytelling way that you can all ignite creativity in the workplace is through storytelling ted is the most fantastic example of storytelling spreading ideas through stories that touch people but in the business environment we have just lost the art of storytelling I think we've all sat through this presentation a stack of cold boring bullets on a screen no emotion no context what have we done stories have the ability to inspire and persuade like these kinds of presentations never will like fax reports and charts just can't rewind a The power of stories childhood we were all natural storytellers we told stories through roleplay we empathized with our characters and captured the hearts minds and imagination of our audience we need to bring this back to the work environment stories have a really powerful ability to package information context and emotion there are a few things that I believe makes stories really successful first of all they start with passion and emotion and vision they're not at all about constraints and timelines they make your customer the hero someone that your audience wants to invent for they're hanging on every word they want to see that customer succeed and lastly stories drive conversations they're not just one-way monologues they leave the audience wanting more they want to understand they want to help bring your idea to life one of my GE Healthcare favorite examples of story LED innovation comes from GE Healthcare Doug Dietz an industrial designer for 20 years decided he was going to go out and see his MRIs being used in the hospital and he made a really unexpected discovery this experience of a child receiving an MRI the child was crying in the hallway and the father leaned down and said remember I told you have to be brave Doug was so moved by this experience that he wanted to learn more he discovered that many children have to be sedated because this experience of an MRI is so terrifying this increased risk cost and stress on the family and the child doug was so determined to solve this problem he went back to GE health care and told this story a group of people were so inspired that they wanted to work with him they wanted to change the ending of this story and the results is pretty incredible they developed the adventure series of scanners this one is actually called the cozy camp experience and as soon as the child opens the door they're off on a camping adventure they snuggle into a sleeping bag and when they go into the MRI machine it's now an adventure in a tent he and his team completely transformed this experience from one of Terror risk and cost to one of complete joy pretty incredible the good news is lots of companies are getting the importance of stories these are pictures from my workplace people are telling stories with their ideas using prototypes and bringing them to life creativity has the power for invention and ultimate success environments experiments and storytelling are just a few of the ways that I believe you can inject it into your workplace but remember creativity is a birthright it's available to all but used by few so I ask you to embrace empower and insist on creativity in your workplace and watch the ideas unfold thank you"
Do schools kill creativity,Sir Ken Robinson,"Good morning. How are you? (Audience) Good. It's been great, hasn't it? I've been blown away by the whole thing. In fact, I'm leaving. (Laughter) Three themes There have been three themes running through the conference, which are relevant to what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here; just the variety of it and the range of it. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out. I have an interest in education. Actually, what I find is, everybody has an interest in education. Don't you? I find this very interesting. If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education -- actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly. (Laughter) If you work in education, you're not asked. (Laughter) And you're never asked back, curiously. That's strange to me. But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, ""What do you do?"" and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face. They're like, ""Oh my God. Why me?"" (Laughter) ""My one night out all week."" (Laughter) Education But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall, because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right? Like religion and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years' time. And yet, we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary. And the third part of this is that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she? Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents, and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly. So I want to talk about education, and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) That was it, by the way. Thank you very much. (Laughter) So, 15 minutes left. (Laughter) ""Well, I was born ... "" (Laughter) A great story I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. She was six, and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her, and she said, ""What are you drawing?"" And the girl said, ""I'm drawing a picture of God."" And the teacher said, ""But nobody knows what God looks like."" And the girl said, ""They will in a minute."" (Laughter) When my son was four in England -- actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest. (Laughter) If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story? (Laughter) No, it was big, it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it. (Laughter) ""Nativity II."" But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about. We considered this to be one of the lead parts. We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: ""James Robinson IS Joseph!"" (Laughter) He didn't have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in? They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there, and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and said, ""You OK with that?"" They said, ""Yeah, why? Was that wrong?"" They just switched. The three boys came in, four-year-old's with tea towels on their heads. They put these boxes down, and the first boy said, ""I bring you gold."" And the second boy said, ""I bring you myrrh."" And the third boy said, ""Frank sent this."" (Laughter) What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. If they don't know, they'll have a go. Am I right? They're not frightened of being wrong. Being wrong I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities. Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists. The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out of it. So why is this? I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago. In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles. So you can imagine what a seamless transition this was. (Laughter) Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought? I was. You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you? Do you? Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you? Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of it. I mean, he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he? (Laughter) How annoying would that be? (Laughter) ""Must try harder."" (Laughter) Being sent to bed by his dad, to Shakespeare, ""Go to bed, now!"" To William Shakespeare. ""And put the pencil down!"" (Laughter) ""And stop speaking like that."" (Laughter) ""It's confusing everybody."" (Laughter) Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, Moving to Los Angeles and I just want to say a word about the transition. Actually, my son didn't want to come. I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16. He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah. He'd known her for a month. (Laughter) Mind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16. He was really upset on the plane. He said, ""I'll never find another girl like Sarah."" And we were rather pleased about that, frankly -- (Laughter) because she was the main reason we were leaving the country. (Laughter) Hierarchy of subjects But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world: every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities. At the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on earth. And in pretty much every system, too, there's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why not? I think this is rather important. I think math is very important, but so is dance. Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do. We all have bodies, don't we? Did I miss a meeting? (Laughter) Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side. If you were to visit education as an alien and say ""What's it for, public education?"" I think you'd have to conclude, if you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything they should, who gets all the brownie points, who are the winners -- I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it? They're the people who come out the top. And I used to be one, so there. (Laughter) And I like university professors, but, you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement. They're just a form of life. Another form of life. But they're rather curious. And I say this out of affection for them: there's something curious about professors. In my experience -- not all of them, but typically -- they live in their heads. They live up there and slightly to one side. They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads. (Laughter) Don't they? It's a way of getting their head to meetings. (Laughter) If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, by the way, get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque on the final night. (Laughter) And there, you will see it. Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat. (Laughter) Waiting until it ends, so they can go home and write a paper about it. (Laughter) Academic ability Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? ""Don't do music, you're not going to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist."" Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken. The whole world is engulfed in a revolution. And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities design the system in their image. If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford to go on that way. In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people. And it's the combination of all the things we've talked about: technology and its transformational effect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population. Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true? When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. If you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter) But now kids with degrees are often heading home Intelligence to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other. It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence. We know three things about intelligence. One, it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it. We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms, we think in movement. Secondly, intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions of a human brain, as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided into compartments. In fact, creativity -- which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things. By the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain, called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women are better at multitasking. Because you are, aren't you? There's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal at home, which is not often ... thankfully. (Laughter) No, she's good at some things. But if she's cooking, she's dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids, she's painting the ceiling -- (Laughter) she's doing open-heart surgery over here. If I'm cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out, the phone's on the hook, if she comes in, I get annoyed. I say, ""Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here."" (Laughter) ""Give me a break."" (Laughter) Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing, ""If a tree falls in a forest, and nobody hears it, did it happen?"" Remember that old chestnut? I saw a great T-shirt recently, which said, ""If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?"" (Laughter) And the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct. epiphany I'm doing a new book at the moment called ""Epiphany,"" which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I'm fascinated by how people got to be there. It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her? Some have. She's a choreographer, and everybody knows her work. She did ""Cats"" and ""Phantom of the Opera."" She's wonderful. I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet, as you can see. (Laughter) Gillian and I had lunch one day. I said, ""How did you get to be a dancer?"" It was interesting. When she was at school, she was really hopeless. And the school, in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said, ""We think Gillian has a learning disorder."" She couldn't concentrate; she was fidgeting. I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you? But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point. It wasn't an available condition. (Laughter) People weren't aware they could have that. (Laughter) Anyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes, while this man talked to her mother about all the problems Gillian was having at school, because she was disturbing people, her homework was always late, and so on. Little kid of eight. In the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian and said, ""I've listened to all these things your mother's told me. I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We'll be back. We won't be very long,"" and they went and left her. But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk. And when they got out of the room, he said to her mother, ""Just stand and watch her."" And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes, and he turned to her mother and said, ""Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick. She's a dancer. Take her to a dance school."" I said, ""What happened?"" She said, ""She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was. We walked in this room, and it was full of people like me -- people who couldn't sit still, people who had to move to think."" Who had to move to think. They did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School. She became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history, she's given pleasure to millions, and she's a multimillionaire. Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down. (Applause) What I think it comes to is this: Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth for a particular commodity. And for the future, it won't serve us. We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children. There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk, who said, ""If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth, within 50 years, all life on Earth would end. If all human beings disappeared from the Earth, within 50 years, all forms of life would flourish."" And he's right. What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination. We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely, and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about. And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are. And our task is to educate their whole being, so they can face this future. By the way -- we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it. Thank you very much."
Grit- the power of passion and perseverance,Angela Lee Duckworth,"When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding, teaching. I went to teach seventh'-graders math in the New York City public schools. And like any teacher, I I did quizzes and tests. I gave out homework assignments. When the work came back, I calculated grades. What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students. Some of my strongest performers did not have stratosphere IQ scores. Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well. And that got me thinking, the kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure, they're hard. Ratios, decimals, the area of a parallelogram. But these concepts are not impossible. And I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough. After several more years of teaching, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological school perspective. In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ. But what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily. So I left the classroom and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist. I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings. And in every study, Today, my question was, who is successful here and why? My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy. We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out. We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition. We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods, asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the of the school year, and of those, who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students? We partnered with private companies asking, which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs and who's going to earn the most money. In In all those very different contexts, one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success. And it wasn't social intelligence, it wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ. It was grit. Grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint. A few years ago, I started started studying grit in the Chicago public schools. I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate. Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate, even when I match them on every characteristic I could measure, things like family income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt when they were at school. So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters? It's also in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out. To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows about building it. Every day, parents and teachers ask me, How do I build grit in kids? What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic? How do I keep them motivated for the long run? The honest answer is, I don't know. What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty. Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments. In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent. So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset. This is an It's an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort. Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to persevere when they fail because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition. So growth mindset I said, is a great idea for building grit, but we need more. And that's where I'm going to end my remarks, because that's where we are. That's the work that stands before us. We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions, and we need to test them. We need to measure whether we've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned. In other words, we need to be gritty about getting kids grittier. Thank you."
How Buildings Can Improve Life â Inside and Out,Doris Sung,"So have you ever walked in front of a glass facade and see yourself in the reflection and try to check yourself out? Oh, wait, wait, I forgot. The glass facade is there, not for you, but it's for the people on the inside to get a great view out. And they're probably looking at you, picking the spinach from your teeth. Have you ever walked in in a city, come upon a very large commercial building, and in the very hot heat of the summer, the doors fly open, you feel that air conditioned air come out and blast you, and you just sit there and wallow in that cool air? Oh, wait, I forgot. That cool air is for the people on the inside. It's a private building. They won't even let you in to use a bathroom. Have you ever wondered why cities get hotter and hotter every year? Oh, wait, I forgot. In order to cool these buildings, the air conditioning systems have to give off air and emit it to the atmosphere, making it hotter and hotter every year, contributing to the heat island effect. So I'm an architect, a building tech innovator, and a 10,000 step a day pedestrian. And I want to talk about how buildings can not only benefit the people on the inside of, but they can actually improve life for those on the outside. So if you go back into history, things were different, right? In the cave, humans had to only worry about the interior. The outside facade was designed by nature. Once leaving the cave, humans then started to stack rocks to make shelter, and in doing so, inadvertently made some of the earliest facades. From there, culture refined, building construction techniques refined. They discovered that the outside facade, that's very public facing, can actually tell stories and narratives. It could be used for public service, so they can tell stories about the family, the histories, the conquest, the wealth, the status. All these types of things appeared on facades, and facades became a thing. So fast forward, we have new technologies, new materials. We're able to thin out the building so it's transparent, the facade itself. But the problem is, glass is a very poor insulator, and that glass then could let the heat in, the cool in. And we had to develop big air conditioning systems, heating systems, to make the interiors even tolerable to stay in. And more recently, we want to keep that transparency. We want the glass, the view. But in order to do that and make the systems efficient, we had to expand that facade system again. So it's highly engineered now to keep out the heat, the cold, the moisture and glare. So all these systems, in order to make it happen, even have four panes of glass to do it. It's comfortable, it works. But what do we do next? So I would like to propose that that thickness of the facade still be used to make people on the inside comfortable. But can we think about the outside portion of the facade benefiting people on the outside? Can we actually think about those thousands of square feet of surface area, no. Millions of square feet of surface area inside the city and use it for the public? Can we use it for infrastructure and for public good? So I'm going to show you a few technologies of other people that do that here. We can make habitats for animals, ecosystems like these, for bees, birds, bats. All kinds of animals are even important to cities. This is a habitat for microorganisms. They're invisible, but they're essential to our livelihood. Just like the microbiomes inside your gut. Think about the probiotic qualities of it. The same thing has to happen to cities. Water is an important resource. And so in this system, it not only collects water, but it also can purify it, as well as store it in a hyper localized way. So that places where water security is an issue starts to eliminate and reduce. Think about areas that have drought. And we can also modulate the surfaces, perforate the different types of materials in order to reduce the amount of noise pollution in streets. So think about garbage trucks, sirens, honking hoards. That type of stuff can actually diminish with new technologies. In my own work, I look at architecture as something that can contribute positively to sustainability, to equity, and to wellness. I'm going to show you two technologies at different levels of development that I use and apply to public health issues. So the first one is a smog eating panel for architecture. And in this case, it actually starts to filter particulate matter and noxious waste in cities, in urban canyon areas. So an urban canyon is when a street is lined by two very tall buildings on both sides, forming a canyon like scenario. And what happens is, in these areas, the air movement is very predictable. It comes from prevailing winds, from thermal convection, from the movement of vehicles in there. And it moves in a circular pattern where it makes it very difficult for the heavy particulate matter to escape. So therefore, it just keeps going through and accumulates in the bottom over time, more and more. So what we're trying to do is modulate the surface so that the surface can allow those prevailing winds to flow into these tubes to filter that smog and move out as fresh air. So you can see here, we use models and wind tunnels that we build, as well as simulation modeling to test it. We pack the tubes together. So that we can maximize the efficacy of it. As well as minimize the material it takes to make it. And we put them in such position of where that wind flow is actually going. And so that it would have an easy time going into the tubes, cleaning the air. And coming out as fresh air. We also use the thermal convection model. Where, in the case the pavement is heating the air. That hot air wants to rise up the face of the building. They can go into these tubes also to filter and then send out fresh air. So it's done in a very passive way. And not only do we try to apply this to building facades. So that the facades are doing the cleaning. We want to actually design these bus shelters that can use this kind of technology. Bringing the freshest pockets of air to the people who spend the most amount of time on the streets breathing the worst air. Another technology that I'm working on is a self shading window system. Here you can see it. Basically, what it does is it shades the interior automatically. So that you can use less energy on air conditioning. The idea came from using the thermal bimetal material. Which is a material that curls when heated. And we make these very low tech robots that we do for fun in our office. I know everybody chuckles when they see it. And it's important that you know that. Because what happens is people get connected to them as if they're little pets, as if they are alive. And even we name them. This one's actually called roly poly. So from there, the idea was that we use this thermal bimetal on the facade of a building. So that it actually can react to the outdoor environment. And through the course of a day, through the course of a year, as the temperature changes all the time, the building would also change to follow them. And if we can animate a building, then possibly we can get people to also feel more connected to the building, like their pets. And if we do that, we can make people smile more. They can cherish their buildings. And they could even feel protective of their cities. So therefore, the happiness level of the city can go up, as well as mental health. So we embrace this idea of putting bimetal in the facade. In this case, it's actually in the cavity of a double glazed standard window system. And we allow these little critters, again, like butterflies, to flutter around and flip. So when the heat comes in, you can see simulated like the sun. These pieces will flip over and respond to any changes outside. What happens, too, is when they flip, you can still see pretty well through the system. It doesn't block your view, so that it turns into a blackout situation. And then when the sun goes away, they go back to their original position. So what happens too, is, because it's a pixelated system, we can put graphics on it. It opens as enclosed whenever it wants to, so that you can start to see the graphics. The result is it's awe inspiring, it's biophilic and it's magical. And I'm happy to say that it's also safe for birds. Right, birds on the outside. So it's actually a great thing. We're hoping to put this technology onto buildings as soon as the end of this year, so stay tuned for that. So how can we get a lot of these cool technologies on buildings? This is the big question. I have three suggestions. The first one is change policy. Can we require owners and contractors and real estate developers to spend a percentage of their construction cost on public centric technologies for facades? Can we do that? Two, think entrepreneurially. Can owners actually rent, lease, sell this facade to others for infrastructure? Can it be to agriculture? Can it be to. You mean even not for profit? You mean situations? Can it be for utility companies? There's a lot of possibilities that can happen. And three, advocate for change. Renters inside the buildings must start to demand that their building facades are much more magnanimous. Because think about it, everybody in these buildings must come out to the streets, too. And together we can actually enjoy the improvements to our society and public health. So next time you go out into a city and you're walking around, look carefully at the buildings. They don't have to be just a pretty face. They can serve a bigger purpose. Thank you."
How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,"I have a confession to make. But first, I want you to make a little confession to me. In the past year, I want you to just raise your hand if you've experienced relatively little stress Anyone? How about a moderate amount of stress? Who's experienced a lot of stress? Yeah, me too. But that is not my confession. My confession is this. I am a health psychologist, and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier. But I fear that something I've been teaching for the last 10 years is doing more harm than good, and it has to do with stress. For years, I've been telling people stress makes you sick. It increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease. Basically, I've turned stress into the enemy, but I have changed my mind about stress, and today I want to change yours. Let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress. This study tracked 30,000 adults in the United States for eight years, and they started by asking people, How much stress have you experienced in the last year? They also asked, Do you believe that stress is harmful for your health? And then, Then they use public death records to find out who died. Okay, some bad news first. People who experience a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43 % increased risk of dying. But that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health. People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die. In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study, including people who had relatively little stress. Now, the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths, 182,000 20,000 Americans died prematurely, not from stress, but from the belief that stress is bad for you. That is over 20,000 deaths a year. Now, if that estimate is correct, that would make believing stress is bad for you, the 15th largest cause of death in the United States last year, killing more people than skin cancer, HIV, AIDS, and homicide. You can see why the study freaked me out. Here I've been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health. So this study got me wondering, can changing how you think about stress make you healthier And here the science says, yes, when you change your mind about stress, you can change your body's response to stress. Now, to explain how this works, I want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out. It's called the social stress test. You come into the laboratory and you're told you have to give a five minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you. And to make sure you feel the pressure, there are bright lights and a camera in your face like this. And the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging nonverbal feedback like this. Now that you're sufficiently demoralized, time for part two, a math test. And unbeknownst to you, the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it. Now, we're going to all do this together. It's going to be fun for me. Okay. I want you all to count backwards words from 996 in increments of seven. You're going to do this out loud as fast as you can, starting with 996. Go. Go faster. Faster, please. You're going too slow. Stop, stop, stop, stop. That guy made a mistake. We are going to have to start all over again. You're not very good at this, are you? Okay, so you get the idea. Now, if you were actually in this study, you'd probably be a little stressed out. Your heart might be pounding, you might be breathing fast or maybe breaking out into a sweat. And normally we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren't coping very well with the pressure. But what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized, was preparing you to meet this challenge. Now, that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at Harvard University. Before they went through the social stress test, they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful. That pounding heart is preparing you for action. If you're breathing faster, it's no problem. It's getting more oxygen to your brain. And participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance. Well, they were less stressed out, less anxious, more confident. But the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed. Now, in a typical stress response, your heart rate goes up and your blood vessels constrict like this. And this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease. It's not really healthy to be in this state all the time. But in the study, when participants view their stress response as helpful, their blood vessel stayed relaxed like this. Their heart was still pounding, but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile. It actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage. Over a lifetime of stressful experiences, this one biological change could be the difference between a stress'-induced heart attack at age 50 and living well into your 90s. And this is really what the new science of stress reveals, that how you think about stress matters. So my goal as a health psychologist has changed. I no longer want to get rid of your stress. I want to make you better at stress. And we just did a little intervention. If you raise your hand and said you'd had a lot of stress in the last year, we could have saved your life. Because hopefully, the next time your heart is pounding from stress, you're going to remember this talk And you're going to think to yourself, this is my body helping me rise to this challenge. And when you view stress in that way, your body believes you and your stress response becomes healthier. So Now, I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from. So we are going to do one more intervention. I want to tell you about one of the most underappreciated aspects of the stress response. And the idea is this: Stress makes you social. To understand the side of stress, we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin. And I know, oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get. It even has its own cute nickname, the cuddle hormone, because it's released when you hug someone. But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in. Oxytocin is a neurohormone. It fine'-tunes your brain's social instinct. It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships. Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family. It enhances your empathy. It even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about. Some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin to become more compassionate and caring. But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin. It's a stress hormone. Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response. It's as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound. And when oxytocin is released in the stress response, it is motivating you to seek support. Your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel instead of bottling it up. Your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other. When life is difficult, your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you. Okay, so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier? Well, oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain. It also acts on your body. And one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress. It's a natural anti'-inflammatory. It also helps your blood vessel stay relaxed during stress. But my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart. Your heart has receptors for this hormone, and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate and heal from any stress'-induced damage. This stress hormone strengthens your heart. And the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support. So when you reach out to others under stress, either to seek support or to help someone else, you release more of this hormone, your stress response becomes healthier, and you actually recover faster from stress. I find this amazing that your stress response has a built'-in mechanism for stress resilience, and that mechanism is human connection. I want to finish by telling you about one more study and listen up because this study could also save a life. This study tracked about a thousand adults in the United States, and they ranged in age from 34 to 93. And they started the study by asking, how much stress have you experienced in the last year? They also asked, how much time have you spent helping out friends, neighbors, people in your community? And then they use public records for the next five years to find out who died. Okay, so the bad news first. For every major stressful life experience like financial difficulties or family crisis, that increased the risk of dying by 30 %. But, and I hope you are expecting a but by now, but that wasn't true for everyone. People who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress'-related increase in dying. Zero. Caring created resilience. And so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your experience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful, you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with others under stress, you can create resilience. Now, I wouldn't necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life, but this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress. Stress gives us access to our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connecting with others. And yes, your pounding physical heart working so hard to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in this way, you're not just getting better at stress. You're actually making a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to face them alone. Thank you. Thank you. This is amazing what you're telling us. It seems amazing to me that a belief about stress can make so much difference to someone's life expectancy. How would that extend to send to advice. If someone's making a lifestyle choice between, say, a stressful job and a non'-stressful job, does it matter which way they go? That it's equally wise to go for the stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it in some sense? Yeah. And one thing we know for certain is that chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort. And so I would say that's really the best way to make decisions is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows.Thank. You so much, Kelly.Thank you. That's really cool."
How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,"The human voice. It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world. Probably it's the only one that can start a war or say, I love you. And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people don't listen to them. Why is that? How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world? What I'd like to suggest, there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking. I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list, but these seven Second, I think, are pretty large habits that we can all fall into. First, gossip. Speaking ill of somebody who's not present. Not a nice habit, and we know perfectly well the person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us. Second, judging. We know people who are like this in conversation, and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time. Third, negativity. You can fall into this. My mother in the last years of her life became very, very negative, and it's hard to listen. I remember one day I said to her, It's October the first today, and she said, I know. Isn't it dreadful? It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative. And another form of negativity, complaining. Well, this is the national art of the UK. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather, about sport, about politics, about everything. But actually, complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blame thrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions. And again, It's hard to listen to somebody who's being like that. Penultimate, the six of the seven. Embroidery, exaggeration. It demeans our language, actually, sometimes. For example, if I see something that really is awesome, what do I call it? And then, of course, this exaggeration becomes out and out lying. We don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us. And finally, dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind. Somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are. Seven deadly sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones, foundations that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world. Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is Hale, and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition, to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is, I think, how our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The H, honesty, of course, being true in what you say, being straight and clear. The A is authenticity, just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity, being your word, actually doing what you say and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people well for two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean, my goodness, you look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously. So hail. Also, now that's what you say, and it's like the old song. It is what you say. It's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible, and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with which will increase the power of your speaking. Register, for example. Now, falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice, however. So if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference? We vote for politicians with lower voices. It's true because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's a register. And we have timbre. It's the way your voice feels. Again, the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. Well, if that's not you, that's not the end of the world. Because you can train. Go get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture, and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice. Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing song, the meta language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's root one for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word monotonic comes from or monotonous, monotone. Also, we have repetitive prosody now coming in, where every sentence ends as if it were a question. When it's actually not a question, it's a statement. If you repeat that one over and over, it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody, which I think is a shame. So let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very, very excited by saying something really, really quickly, or I can slow right down to emphasize. And at the end of that, of course, is our old friend, silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk, is there? We don't have to fill it with ums and ums. Can be very powerful. Of course, pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? Where did you leave my keys? It's a slightly different meaning in those two deliveries. And finally, volume. I can get really excited by using volume. Sorry about that. If I startled anybody. Or I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting. Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice. Of course, where this all comes into play, most of all, is when you've got something really important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing Raising marriage, asking for a raise, a wedding speech, whatever it is. If it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on. And no engine works well without being warmed up. Warm up your voice. Actually, let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warmup exercises that I do before every talk I ever do. Anytime you're going to talk to anybody, important, do these. First, arms up, deep breath in and sigh out like that. One more time. Very good. Now we're going to warm up our lips and we're going to go Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, very good. And now, just like when you were a kid. Now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. Beautiful. You're getting really good at this. And then roll an R. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally, and if I can only do one, the pros call this the siren. It's really good. It starts with we and goes to or. The we is high, the or is low. So you go, We. Oh, we. Fantastic. Give yourselves a round of applause. Take a seat. Thank you. Next Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now, let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well into people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics. I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who are listening consciously in environments which were actually fit for purpose? Or to make that a bit larger. That a bit larger. What would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound? That would be a world that does sound beautiful and one where understanding would be the norm. And that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you. Thank you."
Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator,Tim Urban,"So in college. I was a government major, which means I had to write a lot of papers. Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this. So, you know. You get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done in the first week that with some heavier days later on, everything gets done and things stay civil. And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would have it all ready to go. But then actually the paper would come along and then I would do this. And that would happen every single paper. But then came my 90 page senior thesis, a paper you're supposed to spend a year on. I knew for a paper like that, my normal workflow was not an option. It was way too big a project. So I planned things out and I decided it had to go something like this. This is how the year would go. So I'd start off light and I'd bump it up in the middle months. And then at the end, I would kick it up into high gears. Just like a little staircase. How hard can it be to just walk up the stairs? No big deal, right? But then, the funniest thing happened. Those first few months, they came and went and I couldn't quite do stuff. So we had an awesome new revised plan. And then. But then those middle months actually went by and I didn't really write words. And so we were here. And then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks. And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word. And so I did the only thing I could. I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling not one, but two all'-nighters. Humans are not supposed to pull two all'-nighters. Sprinted across campus, dove in slow motion, and got it in just at the deadline. I thought that was the end of everything. But a week later, I get a call. It's the school. And they say, is this Tim Urban? And I say, yeah. And they say, we need to talk about your thesis. And I say, okay. And they say, it's the best one we've ever seen. That did not happen. It was a very, very bad thesis. I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought this guy is amazing. No, no, it was very, very bad. Anyway, today I'm a writer blogger guy. I write the blog, Wait, But Why? And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination. My behavior has always perplexed the non procrastinators around me. And I wanted to explain to the non procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators and why we are the way we are. Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people. And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non procrastinator. And so I could compare them. And I actually brought them here to show you today. And I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference. And I know that if you're not a trained brain expert, it's not that obvious, but just take a look. Okay, so here's the brain of a non procrastinator. Now, here's my brain. There is a difference. Both brains have a rational decision maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an instant gratification monkey. Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator? Well, it means everything's fine until this happens. So the rational decision maker will make the rational decision to do something productive, but the monkey doesn't like that plan. So he actually takes the wheel and he says, actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan, Tanya Harding scandal, because I just remember that that happened. Then Then we're going to go over to the fridge. We're going to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago. After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard fineman talking about magnets and ends much, much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom. All of that's going to take a while, so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today. Sorry. Now, what is going on here. The instant gratification monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel. He lives entirely in the present moment. He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things easy and fun. Now, in the animal world, that works fine. If you're a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things, you're a huge success. And to the monkey, humans are just another animal species. He has to keep well'-slept, well'-fed, and propagating into the next generation, which in tribal times might have worked okay. But if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times. We're in an advanced civilization, and the monkey does not know what that is, which is why we have another guy in our brain, the rational decision maker, who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do. We can visualize the future. We can see the big picture. We can make long term plans. And he wants to take all of that into account, and he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now. Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well or in leisure time. That's why there's an overlap. Sometimes they agree, but other times it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant for the sake of the big picture. And that's when we have a conflict. And for the procrastinator, that conflict to end a certain way every time, leaving him spending a lot of time in this Orange zone, an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the makes sense circle. I call it the Dark Playground. Now, The Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well. It's where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening. The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun because it's completely unearned and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self'-hatred, all those good procrastinator feelings. And the question is, in this situation with the monkey behind the wheel, how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where really important things happen? Well, it turns out that the procrastinator has a guardian angel, someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments. Someone called the Panic Monster. Now, the panic monster is dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up any time a deadline gets too close or there's danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster or some other scary consequence. And importantly, he's the only thing that the monkey is terrified of. Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently because the people of Ted reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED talk. Now, of course, I said, yes, it's always been a dream of mine to have done a Ted talk in the past. But in the middle of all this excitement, the rational decision maker seemed to have something else in his mind. He was saying, we clear on what we just accepted. Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future? We need to sit down and work on this right now. And the monkey said, totally agree, but also let's just open Google Earth and let's zoom into the bottom of India like 200 feet above the ground. We're going to scroll up two and a half hours till we get to the top of the country so we can get a better feel for India. So that's what we did that day. As six months turned into four and then two and then one, the people of Ted decided to release the speakers. And I opened up the website and there was my face staring right back at me. And guess who woke up? So the panic monster starts losing his mind. And a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem. And the monkey who remember, he's terrified of the panic monster. Boom, he's up the tree. And finally, the rational decision maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk. Now, the panic monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinated behavior, like how someone like me could spend two weeks, unable to start the opening sentence of a paper and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages. And this entire situation with the three characters, this is procrastinator's system. It's not pretty, but in the end it works. And this is what I decided to write about on the blog just a couple of years ago. Now, when I did, I was amazed by the response. Literally thousands of emails came in from All different kinds of people from all over the world doing all different kinds of things. These are people who are nurses and bankers and painters and engineers and lots and lots of PhD students. And they were all writing saying the same thing, I have this problem, too. But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails. These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives, about what this monkey had done to them. And I thought about this and I said, if the procrastinator system works, then what's going on? Why are all these people in such a dark place? Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination. Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given, they all have deadlines. When there's deadlines, the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the panic monster gets involved. But there's a second procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline. So if you wanted to have a career where you want to be a self starter, something in the arts, something entrepreneurial, there's no deadlines on those things at first because nothing's happening at first. Not until you've gone out and done the hard work to get some momentum, to get things going. There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don't involve any deadlines, like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health, working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that isn't working. Now, if procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the panic monster, that's a problem because in all of these non deadlines situations, the panic monster doesn't show up. It's nothing to wake up for. So the effects of procrastination, they're not contained. They just extend outward forever. And it's this long term procrastination that's much less visible and much less talked about than the fun of your short term deadline based kind. It's usually suffered quietly and privately, and it can be the source of a huge amount of long term unhappiness and regret. Rights. And I thought, that's why these people are emailing, and that's why they're in such a bad place. It's not that they're cramming for some project. It's that long term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator at times in their own lives. The frustration was not that they couldn't achieve their dreams, it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them. So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany. That I don't think non procrastinators exist. That's right. I think all of you are procrastinators. Now, you might not all be a mess like some of us, and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines. But remember, the monkey's sneaky The biggest trick is when the deadlines aren't there. Now, I want to show you one last thing. I call this a life calendar. That's one box for every week of a 90 year life. That's not that many boxes. Especially since we've already used a bunch of those. So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar. We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on because everyone is procrastinating something in life. We need to stay aware of the instant gratification monkey. That's a job for all of us. And because there's not that many boxes on there, it's a job that should probably start today. Well, maybe not today, but. You know, sometime soon. Thank you.."
Lessons from My Fatherâs Final Days,Laurel Braitman,"You could say I had an unconventional childhood for a couple reasons. I was born to jewish avocado and citrus growers in rural southern California. My dad was a surgeon at our local hospital, and my mom ran the ranch where we sold our fruit commercially and they rescued donkeys. My early childhood was so beautiful, strange and very privileged. And you could say that I really had nothing to worry about until I did. When I was three and my dad was 42, he was diagnosed with metastatic bone cancer and he was told he had six months to live. He had his right leg amputated and he went in for chemo and radiation, which in the early 1980s, for bone cancer was especially brutal. And then, miraculously, he didn't die. First we got a year, then we got two, then we got five, and then we got seven. And then when I was eleven, the cancer came back and stayed for good. We lived between scans, like that's how our time was meted out, and we lived with the constant ticking clock of mortality. We all have a clock like this. It's just in my family we could hear ours all the time. More often than not, one of his scans turned up something back. Tumor here, a neck tumor there, his other knee. And then he would go in for treatment and then he would come back to us. It was a little bit like a sinister version of the giving tree, only he was trading body parts for time with us. And then, as I mentioned, when I was eleven, really, he found out this is what was going to kill him, and quickly. And that's when he decided that he was going to teach my brother and I all the skills we would need to know to survive without him. And so while other kids were having play dates after school and riding their bikes, my brother and I were in my dad's version of survival school, and we were learning all kinds of things. How to squish a man's eyeballs out, if I was ever attacked. All about the Dewey decimal system, I don't know why. The role of nitrogen in soil health, member nations of the United nations and so much more. He was also doing a lot of things to be present for us after he died. So things like becoming a beekeeper and putting away enough honey that he knew wouldn't spoil so that we would have it for decades. Or planting trees around the ranch that would shade and feed us after he was gone. Or even though I was only twelve at this point, he started a coop of doves and put my brother in charge so that he would let them go at my wedding someday. Throughout it all. I knew he was suffering and often in terrible pain, even though he really did not like to talk about it. And he always used to say that when he couldn't enjoy life with me, my brother and my mom, he would die. And I took this at face value until one afternoon when I was 16, I went into their medicine cabinet looking for something, and I found an unmarked pill bottle with dosage instructions. And I just knew it was a terminal prescription. It was right to die medication before it was legal. I wasn't mad. I immediately understood what he had been saying all those years and that he had a plan, that there was a level of pain and suffering that he wasn't willing to experience. And I didn't say anything to anybody, just put it back and left. And then six months later, we were on the phone and we got into a terrible fight. It was so stupid. It was about me not wanting to do my college applications. And I was so angry. And I hung up on him without saying goodbye and without saying I loved him. I didn't know it, but he was about to take his medication. And I think when it came down to it, saying goodbye to me was just too impossible. By the time I got home, he was unconscious and I would never hear his voice again. I dealt with his death by doubling down on the things he wanted for me. I chased academic honors like a drug. I played not one, but two, division one college sports. I wrote a book. I got my PhD. And then in my mid thirties, I realized I was just completely exhausted. I had been living my entire adult life in a way, to prove to myself that I was good. Because someone who is good is not someone who hangs up on her dying dad. I was using achievement and all of the shiny things that come along with it as a way of anesthetizing my own bad feelings of shame, regret and fear. Those feelings were so big, I worried that if I let myself feel them for even a minute, I would never, ever feel anything else again. But you cannot kill negative feelings. Sadly, with work and avoidance. And mine came back with a jolt. On the outside, I was successful and thriving. And on the inside, I was anxious, terrified, and questioning my worth by avoiding all of the negative feelings. I was muting the fantastic ones, too. I was so scared about missing out and losing more of the best things in life, joy, awe, love, wonderland, that I couldn't even let myself experience them. I needed to find a new way to be. I wanted to find a new way to be. So I did a bunch of stuff. I interviewed a ton of grief specialists and therapists, and I even went out into the wilderness with no food and no tent to do the thing that scared me most, which was to be alone with my own thoughts and feelings and absolutely nothing to distract me from them. I learned I can go about five days without eating, about a week without talking to anyone, and forever without checking my phone. But what hit me the hardest was becoming a volunteer at a grief support organization for kids. So many of them thought they were bad, too. They'd been out of the room playing when their mom died, or they'd said something in anger to an ill parent that they regretted. And I could so clearly see that the painful things that happened to these kids were not their fault. For the first time, I was able to see that that was probably true for me, too. By blaming themselves, the kids were making their losses make sense. Even though it hurt to blame themselves, it gave them a reason for the terrible thing that happened, like losing someone they love for no reason at all. Maybe some of you can relate. Often when we feel difficult things, we blame ourselves because it's easier than admitting we have no control. That's what I had been doing for the 25 years since my dad died. But just because you feel guilt and shame does not mean you did something wrong. Just because you feel regret does not necessarily mean you should have acted differently. It sounds very simple, and it is very hard to accept, but life is nothing except one long sushi conveyor belt of things that are going to test you and teach you at the same time. I know this because first I lost my dad, but then we lost our family home to wildfire. The house and everything in it burned, including almost everything that my dad had worked so hard, hard to do and leave for us after he died. And yet, in one small wooden shed that I do not know how this was spared by the fire, behind a bunch of old farming equipment, we found a couple five gallon plastic buckets of my dad's honey. He'd harvested it more than 30 years earlier, and it was still perfect. The ancient Egyptians used honey as a sweetener and also as a natural antibiotic. On one papyrus, it was written that when the sun God cried, his tears fell to earth and became bees that made honey for the people. Life from grief, pain into sweetness, sorrow into medicine. Two years after the fire, I lost my mom, also to cancer. But quickly. This time, she chose right to die, too, which was legal now. And because of the experience we'd had with my dad, we vowed that this time would be totally different. No one would be left wondering if they messed up or if she knew how much she meant to them. So we had a living memorial service for her, and we each took turns telling her how much she meant to us. And she said the same thing back. It was so beautiful. And it also really hurt. I think if you can swing it, everyone deserves the chance to say goodbye. What I know now, and what I wish I could tell my younger self, is that you cannot have joy without pain. You cannot have resilience without challenges, happiness without sadness or bravery without fear. These things are not opposites. They are partners. There is no such thing as happily ever after. I'm sorry. There is only sadly happy and happily sad. And that's enough. It's more than enough. Honestly. I like to think that before we enter this world, we are asked to sign a kind of cosmic release form acknowledging the extreme risk it is to care deeply about anyone or anything or any place. I imagine it goes something like this. I hereby acknowledge that in exchange for the chance to live, I must accept both pain and pleasure, joy and sorrow, often at the exact same time. This is the ticket price for the chance that is to live. It's never too late to sign it. Thank you."
"Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model.",Cameron Russell,"Hi. My name is Cameron Russell. And for the last little while, I've been a model, actually for ten years. And I feel like there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress. So luckily, I brought an outfit change. This is the first outfit change on the Ted stage, so you guys are pretty lucky to witness It's good, I think. If some of the women were really horrified when I came out, you don't have to tell me now, but I'll find out later on Twitter. I'd also note that I'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds. Not everybody gets to do that. These heels are very uncomfortable, so good thing I wasn't going to wear them. The worst part is putting this sweater over my head because that's when you all laugh at me. So don't do anything while it's over my head. All right. So why did I do that? That was awkward. Well, hopefully not as awkward as that picture. Image is powerful, but also image is superficial. I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds. And in this picture, I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life. I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy's hair. And of course, barring surgery or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform how we look. And how we look, though it is superficial and immutable, has a huge impact on our lives. So today, for me, being fearless means being honest. And I am on this stage because I am a model. I'm on this stage because I am a pretty white woman. In my industry, we call that a sexy girl. And I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but with an honest twist. So the first question is, how do you become a model? And I always I would say, I was scouted, but that means nothing. The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery, and I am the recipient of a legacy. And maybe you're wondering, what is a legacy? Well, for the past few centuries, we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we're biologically programmed to admire, but also as tall, slender figures and femininity and white skin. And this is a legacy that was built for me, and it's a legacy that I've been cashing out on. And I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point. And maybe there are some fashionistas who are like, wait, Naomi, Tyra, Joan Smalls, Lou Wendt. And first, I commend you on your model knowledge. Very impressive. But unfortunately, I have to inform you that in 2007, a very inspired NYU PhD student counted all the models on the runway, every single one that was hired. And of the 660 77 models that were hired, only 27 or less than 4% were non'-white. The next question people always ask me is, Can I be a model when I grow up? And the first answer is, I don't know. They don't put me in charge of that. But the second answer, and what I really want to say to these little girls is why? You can be anything. You could be the President of the United States or the inventor of the next Internet or a Ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet, which would be awesome because you'd be the first one. If after this amazing list, they still are like, no, no, Cameron, I want to be a model. Well, then I say be my boss because I'm not in charge of anything. And you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue or the CEO of H&M or the next Steven Meisell. Saying that you want to be a model when when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the powerball when you grow up. It's out of your control, and it's awesome, and it's not a career path. I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge, because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons, it can just be distilled right into right now. So if the photographer is right there and the light is right there like a nice HMI, and the client says, Cameron, we want a walking shot. Well, then this light goes first nice and long. This arm goes back, this arm goes forward. The head is at three quarters, and you You just go back and forth. Just do that. And then you look back at your imaginary friends 300, 400, 500 times. It will look something like this, hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle. I don't know what happened there. Unfortunately, after you've gone to school and you have a resume and you've done a few jobs, you can't say anything anymore. So if you say you want to be the President of the United States, but your resume reads, Underwear Model, 10 Years. People give you a funny look. The next question people always ask me is, do they retouch all the photos? And yeah, they pretty much retouch all the photos, but that is only a small component of what's happening. This picture is the very first picture that I ever took, and it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini. And I didn't even have my period yet. I know we're getting personal, but I was a young girl. This is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier. Here's me on the same day as this shoot, my friend got to come with me. Here's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue. Here's me on the soccer team and in V magazine. And here's me today. And I hope what you're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me. They are constructions, and they are constructions by professionals, by hairstyles, and makeup artists, and photographers, and stylists, and all of their assistants, and pre'-production, and post'-production. And they build this. That's not me. Okay, so the next question people always ask me is, do you get free stuff? I do I have too many Aiden Shields, which I never get to wear, except for earlier. But the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life, and that's what we don't like to talk about. I grew up in Cambridge, and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money, and they gave me the dress for free. When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver, and she ran around, and of course, we got pulled over. And all it took was a sorry officer, and we were on our way. And I got these free things Because of how I look, not who I am. And there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are. I live in New York. And last year, of the 140,000 teenagers that were sop and frisked, 86 % of them were Black and Latino, and most of them were young men. And there are only 177,000 young Black and Latino men in New York. So for them, it's not a question of, Will I get stopped? But how many times will I get stopped? When will I get stopped? When I was researching this talk, I found out that of the 13'-year'-old girls in the United States, 53% don't like their bodies. And that number goes to 78 % by the time that they're 17. So the last question people ask me is, what is it like to be a model? And I think the answer that they're looking for is, If you you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair, you will be so happy and fabulous. And when we're backstage, we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that. We say, it's really amazing to travel, and it's amazing to get to work with creative, inspired, passionate people. And those things are true, but they're only one half of the story, because the thing that we never say on camera, that I have never said on camera, is I am insecure. And I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day. And if you ever are wondering, if I have thinner thighs and shinier hair, will I be happier? You just need to meet a group of models because they have the thinest thighs and the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes. And they're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet. So when I was writing this talk, I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance because on the one hand, I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say, look, I've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor. And it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with. And it doesn't always make me happy. But mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I'm one of the biggest beneficiaries. But I'm also happy and honored to be up here. And I think that it's great. I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed, and I'd had more agency in my career because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college, which seems so important right now. If there's a takeaway to this talk, I hope it's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures. Okay. Thank you."
The secrets of learning a new language,Lydia Machova,"I love learning foreign languages. In fact, I love it so much that I like to learn a new language every two years, currently working on my eighth one. When people find it out about me, they always ask me, how do you do that? What's your secret? And to be honest, for many years, my answer It would be, I don't know. I simply love learning languages. But people were never happy with that answer. They wanted to know why they are spending years trying to learn even one language, never achieving fluency. And here I come learning one language after another. They wanted to know the secret of polyglots, people who speak a lot of languages. And that made me wonder, too, how do actually other polyglots do it? What do we have in common? And what is it that enables us to learn languages so much faster than other people? I decided to meet other people like me and find it out. The best place to meet a lot of polyglots is an event where hundreds of language lovers meet in one place to practice their languages. There are several of such polyglot events organized all around the world. And so I ready to go there and ask polyglots about the methods that they use. And so I met Benny from Ireland, who told me that his method is to start speaking from day one. He learns a few phrases from a travel phrasebook and goes to meet native speakers and starts having conversations with them right away. He doesn't mind making even 200 mistakes a day because that's how he learns based on the feedback. And the best thing is he doesn't even need to travel a lot today because you can easily have conversations with native speakers from the comfort of your living room using websites. I also met Lucas from Brazil, who had a really interesting method to learn Russian. He simply added a hundred random Russian speakers on Skype as friends. And then Seriously. And then he opened a chat window with one of them and wrote, Hi in Russian. And the person replied, Hi, how are you? Lucas copied this and put it into a text window with another person. And the person replied, I'm fine, thank you. And how are you? Lucas copied this back to the first person. And in this way, he had two strangers have a conversation with each other without knowing about it. And soon he would start typing himself because he had so many of these conversations that he figured out how the Russian conversation usually starts. What an ingenious method, right? And then I met polyglots who always start by imitating sounds of the language and others who always learn the 500 most frequent words of the language. And yet others who always start by reading about the grammar. If I asked a hundred different polyglots, I heard a hundred different approaches to learning languages. Everybody seems to have a unique way how they learn a language. And yet we all come to the same result of speaking our own languages fluently. And as I was listening to these polyglots telling me about their methods, it suddenly dawned on me. The one thing we all have in common is that we simply found ways how to enjoy the language learning process. All of these polyglots were talking about language learning as if it was great fun. You should have seen their faces when they were showing me their colorful grammar charts and their carefully handmade flashcards and their statistics about learning They're very popular using apps or even how they love to cook based on recipes in a foreign language. All of them use different methods, but they always make sure it's something that they personally enjoy. I realized that this is actually how I learn languages myself. When I was learning Spanish, I was bored with the text in the textbook. I mean, who wants to read about Jose asking about the directions to the train station, right? I wanted to read Harry Potter instead because that was my favorite book as a child, and I had read it many times. So I got the Spanish translation of Harry Potter and started reading. And sure enough, I didn't understand almost anything at the beginning, but I kept on reading because I loved the book. And by the end of the book, I was able to follow it almost without any problems. And the same thing happened when I was learning German. I decided to watch Friends, my favorite sitcom in German. And again, at the beginning, it was all just gibberish. I didn't know where one word finished and another one started, but I kept on watching every day because it's Friends. I can watch it in any language. I I love it so much. And after the second or third season, seriously, the dialog started to make sense. I only realized this after meeting other polyglots. We are no geniuses, and we have no shortcut to learning languages. We simply found ways how to enjoy the process, how to turn language learning from a boring school subject into a pleasant activity which you don't mind doing every day. If you don't like writing words down on paper, you can always type them in an app. If you don't listening to boring textbook material or find interesting content on YouTube or in podcast for any language. If you're a more introverted person and you can imagine speaking to native speakers right away, you can apply the method of self'-talk. You can talk to yourself in the comfort of your room describing your plans for the weekend, how your day has been, or even take a random picture from your phone and describe the picture to your imaginary friend. This is how polyglots learn languages. And the best news is it's available to anyone who's willing to take the learning into their own hands. So meeting other polyglots helped me realize that it is really crucial to find enjoyment in the process of learning languages, but also that joy in itself is not enough. If you want to achieve fluency in a foreign language, you'll also need to apply three more principles. First of all, you'll need effective methods. If you try to memorize a list of words for a test tomorrow, the words will be stored in your short term memory and you'll forget them after a few days. If you, however, want to keep words long term, you need to revise them in the course of a few days repeatedly using the so'-called space repetition. You can use apps which are based on this system, such as Anki or Memrise, or you can write lists of words in a notebook using the goldlist method, which is also very popular with many polyglots. If you're not sure which methods are effective and what is available out there, just check out polyglots YouTube channels and websites and get inspiration from them. If it works for them, it will most probably work for you, too. The third principle to follow is to create a system in your learning. We're all very busy and no one really has time to learn a language today, but we can create that time if we just plan a bit ahead. Can you wake up 15 minutes earlier than you normally do? Or that would be the perfect time to revise some vocabulary. Can you listen to a podcast on your way to work while driving? Or that would be great to get some listening experience. There are so many things we can do without even planning that extra time, such as listening to podcasts on our way to work or doing our household chores. The important thing is to create a plan in the learning. I will practice speaking every Tuesday and Thursday with a friend for 20 minutes. I will listen to a YouTube video while having breakfast. If you create a system in your learning, you don't need to find that extra time because it will become a part of your everyday life. And finally, if you want to learn a language fluently, you need also a bit of patience. It's not possible to learn a language within two months, but it's definitely possible to make a visible improvement in two months. If you learn in small chunks every day in a way to enjoy. And there is nothing that motivates us more than our own success. I vividly remember the moment when I understood the first joke in German when watching Friends. I was so happy and motivated that I just kept on watching that day, two more episodes. And as I kept watching, I had more and more of those moments of understanding these little victories. And step by step, I got to a level where I could use the language freely and fluently to express anything. And this is a wonderful feeling. I can't get enough of that feeling. And that's why I learn a language every two years. So this is the whole Polyglot secret. Find effective methods which you can use systematically over the period of some time in a way which you enjoy. And this is how polyglots learn languages within months, not years. Now, some of you may be thinking that's all very nice to enjoy language learning, but isn't the real secret that you, polyglots, are just super talented and most of us aren't? Well, there's one thing I haven't told you about Benny and Lucas. Benny had 11 years of Irish, Gallic and five years of German at school, couldn't speak them at all when graduating. Up to the age of 21, he thought he didn't have the language gene, and he could not speak another language."
Creative Commons and the art of presentations,Herkko Hietanen,"So recently, I found myself in front of an audience of 200 marketing professionals. I was giving a presentation about how the future of presentation is going to look like, how we create presentations, how we build them. But before me, was this great speaker. She used to be a member of a parliament in Finland. But nowadays, she had her own advertising agency. She was talking about how to brand people, how to build brand images around individuals. She used a lot of images. Her first image was what she considered to be the best branding message of all time. It was about Jesus Christ. This was It's a perfect brand for religion, for God, who could be unfair. But with Jesus, you would know that he would forgive sins. So what followed after Jesus was Well, you got to decide. He was talking about Mat Dinukanin, another iconic person in Finnish history, a ski jumper, who, well, later on in his career, here, they did something else as well. These sportsmen have this great karma around them. It's easy to brand them. But sometimes, as she was telling, it's hard to keep that brand positive. So Tiger Woods. And her message was that even the greatest brand can wear out. So while she was delivering this presentation, I wasn't actually listening to her message. I was looking at the images she used. Just like the best presenters of this time, she was using not bullet points to read through the audience, but images. We live in a very visual era where we use a lot of images in our communication. We use them in our blogs, we use them in our presentation, we use them in our reports. It's a very visual era. So I wanted to know where this great presenter was getting her images. So while she was delivering the presentation, I went online, went to Google to find out. It turns out that she had done exactly the same. Her images of Tiger Woods didn't come from her camera. They actually came from Google images. So result number five, exactly the same image. When it came to Mati Nukaren, it was actually buried. It was the first image that she used. So I bet that the Jesus didn't come from her heart. It came from Google as well. Now, there's This is how people make presentations these days. But how many of you have ripped images or taken images from Google images? Yeah. So I guess that's the usual way of doing business, usual way of creating presentations. So my claim is that it's not the Kasa or Bitcoins that are the biggest software, or applications used to do piracy. It's actually the PowerPoints, the keynotes, even our blogs. But nobody actually cares. So should we care? Of course we should. There's a certain irony in this story because This member of Parliament, an ex'-member of Parliament, was actually among the group of people who were setting up a new copyright legislation in Finland. That copyright legislation made it actually a criminal to copy these images and publicly perform them in a commercial setting. Actually, this same legislation that she was setting up could have taken her to a prison for two years. And it could probably take many of you guys, too. Nobody cares. I think we should start caring. And it's not like we don't have alternatives. Creative Commons is a licensing system which was launched in 2001. It enables authors, enables photographers, enables composers, writers to tell other people that you're free to use my work as long as you respect some rights that I've set up. So for example, Wikimedia Commons alone has over 10 million images which are licensed either with Creative Commons licenses or are in public domain. Or if you need more images, there's Flicker, which holds 200 million. Imagine that. 200 million photos which are licensed with credit comms licenses. So some of these licenses only require you to do the attribution, to give credit to the author. You can do whatever you want with the image. You can crop it, you can build upon it, you can use it. You can publicly perform it. No royalties have to be paid, but you have to give credit to the author. So how do you give credit to the author? Well, as I said, this is a legal It's a license. It's a legal document. And legal documents tend to look like this. This is the attribution clause in that five'-pages long license. So many of you who have bumped into licenses like this feel pretty much like this after reading them. So in order to get the license, in order not to infringe that license, You need to actually follow all the steps, describe this document. So how do you do that? So let's take an example. I'm creating a presentation, and I need to find an image of a kid. So first I would have to leave my PowerPoint software, which I use to create these presentations. I would have to find a source where these images are, find a perfect image. This is where we jump in. So I found this image yesterday of a kid, and it's licensed with Creative Commons license. I can use it as long as I tell who the author of the image was. And it's... First, I I would actually have to get it from Flickr, which is somewhat difficult nowadays, to my presentation. So here we are. Next, I would find out the name of the author. That's something that the license requires. And copy that to my presentation. Then I would go find the name of the image, and in this case, it's the img_0374. So I'll attach that to my presentation as well. Next thing, there's a requirement to add the license term so that other people who see my presentation would know that this is Creative Commons license. It's quite fair. I got it for free. I should let other people know that they can do it as well. So on a Flickr page, there isn't actually a URL that's required to be put on my presentation, so I would have to click the Some rights reserved logo there or link and then copy that from there. This person who decided to share this image has also said that you can buy additional rights through getty images. Actually, there's additional rights available, and The license requires you to add that information as well. So I would copy that information, put it on my slide, and then it would start looking like this. Now, I wanted to... You can pretty much see that half of the slide is now goes to the attribution. So I actually will have to reduce the size of the image. So if I do that, it will be considered derivative work, and I would have to also mention that I've used this work in a modified way. So that's a lot. That's a lot. That took me a minute or two, and I'm a a professional. Imagine by the time you have a presentation which has 50 slides, and you repeat this process going back and forward, back and forward 50 times, you're starting to look like this. So people really don't want to infringe copyrights. They want to respect the licenses, and we're seeing a lot of people trying to do that online. It's just way too difficult. So that's why we were seeing in our research that people are failing in this. Even if they're trying, we did a survey with Slideshare. We went through their 50 feature presentation, which had views of tens of thousands, and we examined how they used images. A lot of them, actually, half of them used images from Google. We found a way to figure that out. Ten of those 50 used Creative Commons images. None of those 10 presentation used the images correctly. There was even a presentation there which was advising people how to use Creative Commons licensed images, and even that failed in the attribution part. And the way that licenses are built is that even if you fail in one of these attribution things, you You lose the license. The license is terminated. So you're actually infringing as much as you would if you took the images from Google Images. So people are failing. Failing? Hardly. Imagine a world where this failing wouldn't be an option. Imagine if the software did this for you. Imagine if it would be easier to do things legally, to use images and not worry about attribution, not reading that five'-page license. So this is what we imagined. We got some help from our friends at Google through their Google Summer of Code project. So we designed a system that automates most of this, make sure that your presentation are created legally. So we created a software software. This is a plugin for PowerPoint, where you can actually... Where you can actually... Let's go. Actually, actually, actually. Where you can do the searches without leaving the PowerPoint. You can search for images. It will go out and find images which are Creative Commons licensed. You can review them before, select the one that you really want, and attach that to your presentation. The software really takes care of the attribution part. It creates a slide to the end of the presentation. So every time you add a image to your presentation, it will do the attribution automatically. So who's interested? Who would like to use this system? So every time I do this presentation, people come to ask, We're going to get this. So this would be the attribution slide of my presentation. I was using this to build this presentation. So as you can probably see, it's not quite ready. Actually, I might be infringing in this process as well. It's missing some of the key parts there. That's because it was created by a student, and it's not quite done. So we have a GitHub web page. You can help us to take take this to a level where you can distribute it, where all of you could start using it if you have some gifts in software development. But we didn't stop here. We decided to look at videos. Videos are a special media, which, unfortunately for amateurs, have been really hard. So if you look at YouTube, there's two kinds of videos. It's the one with the talking head. The other one is with the remix of professional content. Well, the third one is like amateur videos of your brother's wedding. But then there's a certain category of creativity which is shown there, which has demanded a lot of attention. Wish master. I I started the presentation by talking about the visual age. This is a storytelling. It's a storytelling using audio, using music, and combining that with visuals. And this presentation was created by tools which are not designed for that. It was created with Microsoft Paint and Windows Moviemaker. So very rough tools. However, with those tools, this person, this individual, this amateur, managed to create 11 million views. That's a lot of demand. People like this, and they've created even more videos which mimic the message that made in this video. So we actually need tools for people. It's not just access to the media, it's tools to modify them. So we decided that, okay, so we might figure a way to do this with PowerPoint, with presentations. Can we do this same with video? And we did. This is a software we created a year ago. It's a web service. Code Monkey, have boring meeting. Boring manager'- You can see there's a video playing, a music playing in the background. At the same time, the user can insert tag words, and we match those tag words with matching images. This is a real'-time video'-creating system. Code Monkey fake baby manager want to write goddamn login page himself. Code Monkey not saying out loud. Code Monkey not crazy. Just grow the code Gold Mucky like phytos. Code Monkey like Dallas, not to do. Code Monkey, very simple man. A big, warm, fuzzy secret heart. Gold Mucky like you. Gold Mucky like you. As a result, you would get a timeline which would include all these images that match your message. It doesn't have to be music video. It can be also a presentation. We're using it for a coursework here. And you can easily modify the images, change them. You can replace the keywords you've set. You can tweak the timings there. The point being that this idea of using visuals in our daily communication is part of our visual era. We as users, we need to demand that from our software. We don't want to go back and forward, back and forward or risk the infringement. We want software that does that for us, that automates that, that help us to make it legal. We as designers, we have to take these lessons, and we can actually integrate them in most of the creative software, because this is what people in the creative era demand, and this is what we owe them, and this is what we should give them. Thank you."
What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness,Robert Waldinger,"What keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life? If you were going to invest now in your future best self, where would you put your time and your energy? There was a recent survey of millennials asking them what their most important life goals were. And over 80 % said that a major life goal for them was to get rich. And another 50 % of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous. And we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder and achieve more. We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life. Pictures of entire lives, of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them, those pictures are almost impossible to get. Most of what we know about human life, we know from asking people to remember the past. And as we know, hindsight is anything but 2020. We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life, and sometimes memory is downright creative. But what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time? What if we could study many people, from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy? We did that. The Harvard study of Adult Development may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done. For 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men. Year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health, and of course, asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out. Studies like this are exceedingly rare. Almost all of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field. But through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers, this study has survived. About 60 of our original 724 men are still alive, still participating in the study, most of them in their 90s. And we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men. And I'm the fourth director of the study. Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men. The first group started in the study when they were sophomores at Harvard College. They all finished college during World War II, and then most went off to serve in the war. And the second group that we've followed was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods, boys who were chosen for the study, specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the Boston of the 1930s. Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water. When they entered the study, all of these teenagers were interviewed. They were given medical exams. We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents. And then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life. They became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors, one President of the United States. Some developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia. Some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top And some made that journey in the opposite direction. The founders of this study would never, in their wildest dreams, have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later, telling you that the study still continues. Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives. Many of the inner city, Boston men ask us, Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting. The Harvard men never ask that question. To get the clearest picture of these lives, we don't just send them questionnaires. We interview them in their living rooms. We get their medical records from their doctors. We draw their blood. We scan their brains. We talk to their children. We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns. And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study, many of the women said, it's about time. So what have we learned? What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we've generated on these lives. Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or Fame or working harder and harder. The clearest message that we get from this 75 year study is this good relationships keep us happier and healthier, period. We've learned three big lessons about relationships. The first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills. It turns out that people who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to community are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer than people who are less well connected. And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic. People who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy Their health declines earlier in midlife, their brain functioning declines sooner, and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely. And the sad fact is that at any given time, more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely. And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage. So the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship, but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters. It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health. High conflict marriages for example, without much affection, turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced. And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective. Once we had followed our men, all all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian and who wasn't. And when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it wasn't their middle'-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old. It was how satisfied they were in their relationships. The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. And good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old. Our most happily partnered men and women reported in their 80s that on the days when they had more physical pain, their moods stayed just as happy. But the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain, it was magnified by more emotional pain. And the third big lesson that we learn about relationships on our health is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies. They protect our brains. It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your 80s is protective. That the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need, those people's memories stay sharper longer. And the people in relationships where they feel they really can't count on the other one, those are the people who experience earlier memory decline. And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time. Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out. But as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough, those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories. So this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well'-being, this is wisdom that's as old as the hills. Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore? Well, we're human. What we'd really like is a quick fix, something we can get that will make our lives good and keep them that way. Relationships are messy and they're complicated, and the hard work of tending to family and friends, that's not sexy or glamorous. It's also lifelong. It never ends. The people in our 75'-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates. Just like the millennials in that recent survey, many of our men, when they were starting out as young adults, really believed that Fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life. But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family, with friends, with community. So what about you? Let's say you're 25 or you're 40 or you're 60. What might leaning into relationships even look like? Well, the possibilities are practically endless. It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together, long walks or date nights. Or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges. I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain. More than a century ago, he was looking back on his life, and he wrote this. There isn't time, so brief is life for bickerings, apologies, heart burnings, callings to account. There is only time for loving. But an instant, so to speak, for that. The good life is built with good relationships. Thank you."
What to do when you offend someone,Lamber Fisher,"They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. But let's be honest. Do we really want to live in a world where we no longer maintain good intentions? Despite how negative and polarizing the world may seem at times, many of us are still doing our best to maintain good intentions and positive interactions with each other. And yet, it can be frustrating sometimes to discover that something that we've said or done was still experienced by someone else as being offensive. In response to this, it's easy to get stuck in unhealthy, extreme reactions, such as strongly defending our character from perceived attacks, only to realize that we've invalidated someone else's feelings as a result. Or maybe we walk on eggshells or jump through every hoop possible to avoid offending anyone, only to shame ourselves for making any mistakes or blame others for being too sensitive. Or maybe we just give up altogether, concluding that, you know, you just can't make anybody happy these days, so why even try? I don't know about you, but that makes me scared, because I don't know how we can maintain good intentions and positive interactions with each other if we are still going around living in fear of even unintentional offenses. However, I believe there's another way. With your help, I believe that we can maintain good intentions, avoid the shame and blame game, and even strengthen interactions with those who we encounter on a regular basis. If that's of interest to you, then I invite you to join me in learning to accept the inevitability of offense. Let me explain. During my 20-plus years as a marriage and family therapist, I've considered it an honor to be welcomed into the emotionally vulnerable spaces of new and seasoned couples through a variety of life circumstances and challenges. During that time, I've gained a great appreciation for four relationships- strengthening principles that have helped not only the couples who I serve, but also individual, personal and professional relationships in all walks of life. This first relationship-strengthening principle comes to life for me during one of my greatest professional joys, which is when premarital engaged couples come into my office with a big smile on their face, expressing how confident they are that they have found the one who they are to spend the rest of their life with, primarily because they never disagree or argue with each other.(Laughter) That's when I get a big smile on my face and I say, ""That is awesome! You guys are in the right place, because I can help you fix that. (Laughter) They get confused just like that, and they say, ""Wait, what? You want us to argue and fight with each other?"" I reassuringly say, ""No, no. But I do want you to know that you can disagree with each other and still love each other. You can misunderstand each other and not conclude that 'maybe we weren't meant to be, 'or end the relationship prematurely due to seemingly irreconcilable offenses. You see, no matter how hard you try, you will, we will all offend someone at some point in time in our lives. You know how I know? Because there's no absolute list of what's offensive and what's not. What's offensive changes over time. What's offensive to one person is perfectly fine to the next. After all, you can't tell someone what they should be offended by and what they shouldn't. Not only that, but what's offensive is not always about an absolute list of right or wrongs, but more often something that was said or done that reminds someone of a past hurt and makes them fear that future harm is on the way. As a result, if you find out that you've unintentionally offended someone, I encourage you to resist the temptation to get stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense. Instead, accept the inevitability of offense. Take the time to learn what made that offensive to the person in front of you, and then make every reasonable effort to reduce the likelihood of repeating that offense moving forward. The second relationship-strengthening principle that comes to life for me often does so when I see couples believing that if you don't know me by now, you will never, never know me. (Laughter) As if to convey that, if you don't instantly understand and know everything about me, then you must not truly love me. But in reality, I found that some of the best and long-lasting couple relationships are the ones that embrace not knowing everything that there is to know about a person instantly, but actually appreciate the opportunity to keep the relationship fresh by learning new things about each other for years to come. Similarly, in your personal and professional relationships, I encourage you to acknowledge that you can't know everything there is to know about everyone all the time. Or put more simply, I encourage you to accept the inevitability of ignorance. Now, I don't know about you, but I grew up with ignorance as an insult synonymous with lack of intelligence. But in reality, ignorance is merely the lack of knowledge. And if we're honest, we all lack knowledge about a variety of different life circumstances, including the things that many people find offensive. However, I do fair warn you, if you are informed that you've unintentionally offended someone and the first thing out of your mouth is the justification for how you didn't know that it was offensive, it is emotionally reasonable for someone else to respond in frustration. ""How could you not know? Everybody knows that that's offensive."" Except there's nothing that everyone knows. Not only that, but how did you not know that it was offensive? Maybe you were never taught by someone important to you that it was offensive. Maybe you never personally experienced the hurt that would have taught you that was offensive. Maybe you were never surrounded by people who experienced the hurt that would have taught you, by witnessing, that it was offensive, how could you not know? Or how could you also know? What makes this not just another insensitive, defensive excuse is that we can learn to accept the inevitability of ignorance as a temporary state. Turning that accusation into an opportunity to reduce our ignorance by increasing our knowledge and using that knowledge to reduce the likelihood of the next offense moving forward. The third relationship-strengthening principle comes to life for me when I see couples stuck in the reasonable, yet futile search for perfect communication. For, while healthy communication is essential to a good relationship, it's also perfectly reasonable for partners to use the same words but mean completely different things based on their family of origin and life experiences, even before meeting each other. This often results in partners getting stuck in a defensive battle, protecting themselves from perceived threats that were never really attacks in the first place, but unhealthily expressed pleas for understanding, support and empathy. Similarly, in your personal and professional relationships, I encourage you to learn to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding. For even our reasonable intentions can result in unintentionally negative impacts leading others to feel the need to protect themselves from us as a perceived threat. But wait a minute. Why would you be a perceived threat if all you have is good intentions? Well, consider this for a moment. Consider the possibility that before their encounter with you, they experienced nine times of someone else saying the exact same thing or doing the exact same thing that you did. But after each of those times, it was followed by a hurtful experience. Then you come along, the tenth person to do or say that exact thing. Despite your reasonable intentions, it's also reasonable for them to see the pattern and to fear similar harm from you. It's because of this that if you find out that you've unintentionally offended someone, I encourage you to resist the temptation of getting stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense and instead ask yourself, ""Am I really being attacked? Or have I simply reminded them of a past hurt and made them fear the future harm is on the way?"" If that's even a remote possibility in your life, I encourage you to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding and channel your efforts into the fourth relationship-strengthening strategy, which is to learn to reassure the hurt person that you are not the threats that they fear that you are. You see, when my couples get stuck in a defensive battle protecting themselves from perceived threats and misrepresentations, what turns things around is not more explanations and justifications. It's instead, when one or both partners can get to the point of saying, ""I see better than I did before your past hurts. I see the impact that they've had on your current unmet needs, and I want to come alongside of you to help make your future better than your hurtful past."" Similarly, in your personal and professional relationships, I encourage you to look for opportunities to reassure a hurt person that you are not the threat that they fear that you are. How can you do this? Well, it can start with a verbal acknowledgment of the limitations of your intentions, recognizing that your intent does not always determine your impact. But some of you, even here, may actually resent intentions, but I find that many people don't actually resent intentions because they actually have a problem with good intentions. But more often, because people have received the gift of good intentions being offered instead of what they really need: changed behavior. You can separate yourself from these experiences by making sure that your verbal acknowledgment of reassurance is always followed by a meaningful behavioral change, showing that your commitment is more than just words, but action showing to make their future better than their hurtful past. Now, I'm not really here to tell you one more thing that you should already be doing, but might not be doing. No. I'm here to tell you what the next person who you unintentionally offend needs you to do. They need you to accept the inevitability of offense. Getting stuck in the shock of the existence of the offense does less to help that person than your efforts to reduce the likelihood of the next offense. They need you to accept the inevitability of ignorance. You don't need to know everything about everyone all the time, but you can accept what you dont know, value what you do know and learn more, one experience at a time. They need you to accept the inevitability of misunderstanding, acknowledging that your intent does not always determine your impact. And they need you to reassure hurt persons that you are not the threat that they fear that you are. You can do this with flexibility and openness to change, but not change out of correction for being a bad person, but change out of consideration for the wellbeing of someone else. You never know. You might be the one in your environment to reduce the likelihood of the next misunderstanding-influenced divorce, friendship breakup, job resignation, or even cultural cancellation, all often influenced by unintentional offenses. And just like my couples, I want you to know that you don't have to live in fear of even unintentional offenses. Instead, you can accept the inevitability of offense. Make every reasonable effort to reduce the frequency of those offenses and move forward, repairing and strengthening every relationship you encounter. Thank you."
"The problem with being ""too nice"" at work",Tessa West,"So why is it the case that when we are feeling the most anxious, uncomfortable, socially awkward versions of ourselves, when our hearts are pounding and our palms are sweating and we feel like crawling out of our skin, are we also the most nice and often generic to the people around us? I'm a social psychologist, and I've been studying the science of uncomfortable social interactions for over  years. So everything from new roommate relationships, negotiations, upward feedback with your boss to doctor patient-interactions, those moments where you need to break in and say, ""Yeah, for the last  minutes, I actually have no idea what you were talking about. Can we maybe rewind a bit?"" And to study these things, I look at three main outcomes. First, I look at what people say, the things we can control, how friendly we are, how much we complement one another, how much we give gracious feedback. Second, I look at the things that are tougher for us to control, our nonverbal behaviors, things like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, playing with our hair, doodling even, even our tone of voice. And then I look at the things that are impossible for us to control our under-the-skin responses, our physiology, our cardiovascular reactivity, things like blood pressure, heart rate, these types of things that we often don't even really realize that we're feeling. And the way I do this is by having people come into the lab and interact with each other in a bunch of different settings, and I have them negotiate with each other, I have them get acquainted with each other. And often it's the case that in these interactions, people are required to give some form of feedback to their partner. Tell them honestly what they're thinking or feeling, come in with an offer for a negotiation, tell them what they could have done better next time. And I think we all kind of know what it feels like to be in one of these studies. You might not know what it would really feel like to be in one of my studies. There's a lot of equipment involved, but we plug people up to all of these things to measure these under-the-skin responses. We videotape them to capture those behaviors that I just mentioned. Now, to get us all into this mindset of what it's like to feel awkward, but maybe potentially a little bit nice, I want you all to think about what was the last awkward interaction that you had. OK, so keep this thought in your mind. You can think about it for a few moments, because in a couple minutes, I'm actually going to randomly call on someone based on your seat to have you come up and share your story of what that moment felt like. So before we do that, I just want you all to kind of get a sense of the typical pattern that we see when people are engaging in these interactions. So we bring them into the lab, we hook them up to all this equipment and within moments, within the first  seconds, we start to see those stress responses that I mentioned. Their heart rate goes up, their blood pressure increases. It doesn't take much to get people to start to feel anxious. Next, we see it in those nonverbal behaviors. They start to fidget, they avoid eye contact, they pull their chair a couple inches away from the person who's sitting next to them, in an effort just to get a little bit more distance. One of my favorite findings is in doctor-patient interactions, uncomfortable doctors, they look down at the chart more, or they look more at the computer screen instead of making eye contact with those patients. So let's all return to your awkward moment. Does everyone have an awkward moment in mind or thinking about one? How many of you have increases in your heart rate, maybe your palms are sweating? You can start to feel yourself getting a little tingly just with the mere thought of being called upon today? Hey, a few of you. How many people would actually be excited about that opportunity? Not -- OK, same people. (Laughter) How many of you, if I did call on you, would walk up here, you would grin through gritted teeth like this and you would do it even though you secretly hated me the whole time? A few of you. Don't worry, I'm not going to actually do this. This was all just a ruse to teach you a lesson which is, in uncomfortable social interactions, we often don't have a social script of what to do. Instead of telling people what we really think, what we really feel, we do the nice thing that makes us incredibly uncomfortable. Now one of my favorite findings illustrating this effect is in the context of negotiations. I went to a major firm and I brought people together who were used to working with one another, and we had them engage in a negotiation. And at the end of it, there was a winner and there was a loser. So we said to the winner, you know, this is really a study about feedback. And what we would like you to do is give some constructive feedback to the person who just lost. What are some things that they could do better next time? What are some potential missteps? How many of you think that that's what they actually did, they really followed our instructions? OK, nobody. [You] can see where this is going. What we found is that even when we're talking to someone who just lost a negotiation to us, we tend to bend over backwards. We say things like, ""The way you made that really early offer and didn't even ask for a counter, that was amazing."" Or ""It was so great how you didn't even ask me anything about my side, or what I was willing to kind of, you know, change on or be flexible on."" People layered on the compliments to someone who they just beat in a negotiation, telling them how great they are. So often these kinds of interactions that take the form of what Ill call anxious niceness, they involve a lot of compliments, telling people what they do well in a very general, non-specific way. But a lot of my work actually looks at what's it like to be on the receiving end of these types of interactions. How do you feel when you interact with someone over and over again who's giving off these kinds of brittle smiles? These are typically the kinds of facial expressions that we actually see from people, kind of sneering, a little bit of side eye, you know, arms crossed, these types of things. After a lifetime of interacting with someone who engages in anxious niceness, what we find is that most people on the receiving end are racial minorities. They are disadvantaged group members, they are the type of people that we are worried about appearing prejudiced in front of, and that anxiety is regulated by being over-the-top nice to these folks. We also find that these individuals tend to be more synchronized to and attentive to the how-we-say-it piece than the what-we-say part. So in one study, we had Black and white Americans interact with each other in a cross-race interaction, and we brought them into the lab and we measured the physiology of both partners. What this allowed us to do is capture the degree to which people stress. Those under-the-skin responses can actually be caught by their partners. And what we expected to find is that the Black participants would become more synchronized, physiologically, to those whites. They'd be more attuned to those, kind of, nonverbal signals of anxiety. And that's exactly what we found. The more anxious those white participants appeared, the more they fidgeted, the more they avoided eye contact, even the higher their cortisol reactivity, indicating some real deep, kind of, under-the-skin stress response, the more those Black participants became linked up to them over time. And I think this finding is a little bit terrifying. I think it means that we often think of our own stress and our own physiology as independent of the people we interact with, but our bodies are not always our own, our physiology is not always our own. And if you spend a lifetime interacting with people who are so nice to you, in an effort to control their anxiety, you could potentially catch that stress. It could negatively affect your bodies. Now often what we find is the type of feedback that people are actually getting isn't always super direct. Sometimes it's a little bit patronizing. So you could probably see where I'm going with this. Having over-the-top positive nice feedback can harm your performance, it can make it very difficult for you to climb up, difficult to kind of know where you stand, what you should do better, what you should stop doing, but can also damage people in ways that we often don't think about. It can affect their reputations outside of the interaction context. So imagine the case that you're one of these people who loves giving this general, nice feedback, and you have someone who works for you, and a recruiter calls, maybe a past employee, a recruiter calls you, or someone asks you for a letter of recommendation, the kinds of things you're going to put are going to be like, ""They're are real team player."" ""They have great energy at work."" Generic things. Yes, they're nice, but they are not very telling about what that person is really like. And what we find is that the readers of these things, at best, think to themselves, ""Wow, they must not really know this person at all. I don't even know what this means."" At worst, they think to themselves, ""Well, they probably have some real opinions. They're just afraid to share them."" So these kinds of general positive feedback tend to actually harm people's reputation when they're not backed up with real data. So I think we have to then think about what is the solution to this problem. Is it the case that we should all just be meaner to each other in an effort to be more direct? I don't think that's the case at all. I think there are some things we can do, and I'm going to highlight three of them, to improve the degree to which we give clear, consistent feedback to people, particularly in the workplace. So first we need to ask ourselves the question, how many people are on board with this niceness culture, really? There's a bit of a plural ignorance that goes on when we think about how nice we are to people at work. What I've found is that for every one person who loves this kind of general, generic, nice feedback, there's another person who feels like it's lazy, who feels like it's not helpful. And I actually learned this lesson the hard way from one of my students recently. She was giving a practice talk in my lab, and she spent weeks and weeks preparing it, probably harder than anyone else I'd ever seen on preparing a talk like this. And then she went and gave it, and she came back and I said, ""How did the talk go? Did it go well?"" She said, ""It was terrible. It was horrible. It was the worst experience."" I said, ""Well, what happened?"" And she said, ""All I got were a bunch of 'Great jobs,' That was interesting and then some clap emojis from the people on Zoom. Not a single person asked a tough question,"" she said. And I had this moment where I realized that positive feedback can come across as lazy feedback. It can come across as disengaged feedback. And so if we want to change this culture, we actually need to first do a quick pulse of how many people are actually more interested in doing the tougher, constructive forms of this type of feedback. So you might be thinking to yourselves, ""Alright, I might be on board with this idea of tough, yet honest feedback. So what should I do? Should I go to people and say, Alright, do you want me to be ... nice or honest and useful?'"" No, do not do this. You will, by and large, get a lot of people telling you, ""You know, I actually just want to keep it nice. That just feels a lot more comfortable for me."" What I learned in my work is that this process I've been talking about, about giving anxious, nice feedback, is just as much about the feedback receiver as it is about the feedback giver. People get into a bit of a dance with each other. I give you nice feedback, you kind of know it's BS, but you smile and say thank you and then, you know, go on your way. It takes a lot to break that interpersonal cycle. And to do that, we have to think about how we actually want to frame our feedback to other people. So instead of asking people, ""Should I be nice or honest and useful?"" What I like to do is ask people, ""Can I give you feedback on a couple dimensions?"" Can we think about feedback as general versus specific? Another dimension would be, can we think about things that you're doing well you should keep doing versus things that ""please stop."" And I'll get in a moment to how we can actually frame that form of negative feedback. So I think a lot of us are actually pretty decent at the positive general feedback, right? ""I love how timely you are."" But what does that mean? It could mean that you're on time for meetings, it could mean that you turn your work in on time, it could mean it in a very global way of, ""You sure managed to do a lot in five years."" Or it could mean something so specific, like, Its so helpful that you send in your reports by  pm, but I don't really want to comment on all those other kinds of forms of being timely. And when we do the kind of general feedback that is negative, the ""please stop,"" we need it to be specific. So kind of, one of the more common forms of general negative feedback people get is ""You don't take enough initiative here."" How many of you have ever been told, Please take some more initiative? I think most of us at some point in our lives have experienced this. What does that mean? Does it mean I should speak up more in meetings? Does it mean I should be quicker on my email? Does it mean I should do your job without complaining about doing your job, which is often what it actually means? We have to break it down into the specifics, and that could include things like, ""Don't wait for Tom to ask if you found any errors before you say, 'Tom, I found some errors.'"" Now an important piece here is what people should do instead. Often if we get to the stage where we're comfortable enough telling people, I have a specific, critical, negative thing I want to tell you, -- Please stop interrupting people, you know, not telling Tom about the errors, showing up five minutes late with coffee so I know what you were doing during those five minutes -- we dont tend to replace them with anything, but we know from our personal lives that replacing negative critical, ""please stop"" behaviors is absolutely essential. So I want to take you out of the workplace for a moment. And we're going to go to the bedroom. Yes, I said we're going to the bedroom. So imagine it's the case that you just had sex with someone for the first time. OK, we're all there, we've done a lot of mentalizing today. And you turn to the person and you say, ""Those last three things you just did back there, no good. They're all bad. Didn't like any of them."" They're going to look at you in shock and surprise and say, ""Well, what should I do instead,"" right? And until we're ready to actually fire the person or kick them out of bed or fire them from our team, we have to focus on those replacement behaviors, what they should be doing instead. And I think as we think through kind of, scaling this type of feedback, it can be very scary to make these types of change. What I found is that cultures of anxious, nice feedback are ingrained. They're systemic, they are deeply embedded in a community, in the workplace, in a team, even in dyadic interpersonal relationships. And so to break that cycle, you have to start small, you need to start neutral. And by neutral I mean things that are not scary to hear critical feedback on. You might be thinking to yourself, what's some neutral feedback that you could give me at the end of my talk? How about ""I would switch the order of the points on your talk"" or ""I would change the font. ""These types of feedback are specific, and so they're useful, but they're not scary to deliver and they're not actually scary to receive. And what we find is that when people take these baby steps to work up to this type of feedback, they are much less anxious in the delivery. So those behaviors I opened with of people fidgeting, engaging in what we call a brittle smile, avoiding eye contact, they actually go down and so do those stress responses when you know and you're anticipating giving this kind of feedback that isn't going to sting. And I think as you work through this, I don't want to be a proponent of killing niceness entirely. I think it's actually really important to put niceness in the delivery of your feedback, and that can come across in a bunch of different ways. It can come across as by showing you're engaged, you listened. You know what the person's actually trying to do, you're aligned with their goals. The first time I actually got this type of critical nice feedback was after a talk I gave and the person came up to me and she said, ""Can I give you some feedback?"" And immediately my heart started pounding. I'm like, oh great, here we go. No one likes hearing, ""Can I give you some feedback?"" And she opened with three things that she thought I did well. ""I really liked points one, two and three you made in that talk. They really resonated with me. But you have this habit when you're concentrating of looking up and to the right, and so you spent half the talk kind of staring at the ceiling or the exit sign in this case, instead of making eye contact with the audience. And it's distracting and it creates a distance."" So I thought a little bit about it with my eyes probably rolled up inside my head, and I thought, OK, I can actually make that change. It doesn't feel super scary. And so I did. I made that change, and I thought about how she framed that feedback through this culture of niceness. So I want to wish you all luck on your journey of trying to change culture of feedback, killing anxious niceness, and hopefully have some concrete steps to help you move forward. Thank you."
How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,"A few years ago, I broke into my own house. I had just driven home, it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter, I had been visiting my friend, Jeff, across town, and the thermometer on the front porch read minus  degrees -- and don't bother asking if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit, minus  is where the two scales meet -- it was very cold. And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets, I found I didn't have my keys. In fact, I could see them through the window, lying on the dining room table where I had left them. So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows, and they were locked tight. I thought about calling a locksmith -- at least I had my cellphone, but at midnight, it could take a while for a locksmith to show up, and it was cold. I couldn't go back to my friend Jeff's house for the night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning, and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase. So, desperate and freezing cold, I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window, cleared out the shards of glass, I crawled through, I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening, figuring that in the morning, on the way to the airport, I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it. This was going to be expensive, but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith, so I figured, under the circumstances, I was coming out even. Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress. It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate, it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking. So the next morning, when I woke up on too little sleep, worrying about the hole in the window, and a mental note that I had to call my contractor, and the freezing temperatures, and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe, and, you know, with all the cortisol in my brain, my thinking was cloudy, but I didn't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy. (Laughter) And it wasn't until I got to the airport check-in counter, that I realized I didn't have my passport. (Laughter) So I raced home in the snow and ice,  minutes, got my passport, raced back to the airport, I made it just in time, but they had given away my seat to someone else, so I got stuck in the back of the plane, next to the bathrooms, in a seat that wouldn't recline, on an eight-hour flight. Well, I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep. (Laughter) And I started wondering, are there things that I can do, systems that I can put into place, that will prevent bad things from happening? Or at least if bad things happen, will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe. So I started thinking about that, but my thoughts didn't crystallize until about a month later. I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner, and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window, and, you know, forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight. (Laughter) It's something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein, who had written about it a few years before, also called the pre-mortem. Now, you all know what the postmortem is. Whenever there's a disaster, a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong, right? Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained, you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening, or to minimize the damage. So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem. Some of them are obvious, some of them are not so obvious. I'll start with the obvious ones. Around the home, designate a place for things that are easily lost. Now, this sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science to back this up, based on the way our spatial memory works. There's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus, that evolved over tens of thousands of years, to keep track of the locations of important things -- where the well is, where fish can be found, that stand of fruit trees, where the friendly and enemy tribes live. The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged. It's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts. And if you're wondering, somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels, and they could still find their nuts. They weren't using smell, they were using the hippocampus, this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things. But it's really good for things that don't move around much, not so good for things that move around. So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports. So in the home, designate a spot for your keys -- a hook by the door, maybe a decorative bowl. For your passport, a particular drawer. For your reading glasses, a particular table. If you designate a spot and you're scrupulous about it, your things will always be there when you look for them. What about travel? Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards, your driver's license, your passport, mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud. If these things are lost or stolen, you can facilitate replacement. Now these are some rather obvious things. Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol. Cortisol is toxic, and it causes cloudy thinking. So part of the practice of the pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best, and you should put systems in place. And there's perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you're confronted with a medical decision to make. And at some point, all of us are going to be in that position, where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one, to help them with a decision. And so I want to talk about that. And I'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition. But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making, and indeed for financial decision-making, and social decision-making -- any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts. So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says, ""I just got your lab work back, your cholesterol's a little high."" Now, you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke. And so you're thinking having high cholesterol isn't the best thing, and so the doctor says, ""You know, I'd like to give you a drug that will help you lower your cholesterol, a statin."" And you've probably heard of statins, you know that they're among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world today, you probably even know people who take them. And so you're thinking, ""Yeah! Give me the statin."" But there's a question you should ask at this point, a statistic you should ask for that most doctors don't like talking about, and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less. It's for the number needed to treat. Now, what is this, the NNT? It's the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped. And you're thinking, what kind of crazy statistic is that? The number should be one. My doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me if it's not going to help. But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way. And it's not the doctor's fault, if it's anybody's fault, it's the fault of scientists like me. We haven't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough. But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that  percent of the drugs work in only  to  percent of the people. So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin, what do you suppose it is? How many people have to take it before one person is helped? . This is according to research by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband, independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com. I ran through the numbers myself. people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack, stroke or other adverse event is prevented. Now you're probably thinking, ""Well, OK, one in  chance of lowering my cholesterol. Why not, doc? Give me the prescription anyway."" But you should ask at this point for another statistic, and that is, ""Tell me about the side effects."" Right? So for this particular drug, the side effects occur in five percent of the patients. And they include terrible things -- debilitating muscle and joint pain, gastrointestinal distress -- but now you're thinking, ""Five percent, not very likely it's going to happen to me, I'll still take the drug."" But wait a minute. Remember under stress you're not thinking clearly. So think about how you're going to work through this ahead of time, so you don't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot. people take the drug, right? One person's helped, five percent of those  have side effects, that's  people. You're  times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug. Now, I'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not. I'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor. Medical ethics requires it, it's part of the principle of informed consent. You have the right to have access to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not. Now you might be thinking I've pulled this number out of the air for shock value, but in fact it's rather typical, this number needed to treat. For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of , removal of the prostate for cancer, the number needed to treat is . That's right,  surgeries are done for every one person who's helped. And the side effects in that case occur in  percent of the patients. They include impotence, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, rectal tearing, fecal incontinence. And if you're lucky, and you're one of the  percent who has these, they'll only last for a year or two. So the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward. You don't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot. And you also want to think about things like quality of life. Because you have a choice oftentimes, do you I want a shorter life that's pain-free, or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end? These are things to talk about and think about now, with your family and your loved ones. You might change your mind in the heat of the moment, but at least you're practiced with this kind of thinking. Remember, our brain under stress releases cortisol, and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down. There's an evolutionary reason for this. Face-to-face with a predator, you don't need your digestive system, or your libido, or your immune system, because if you're body is expending metabolism on those things and you don't react quickly, you might become the lion's lunch, and then none of those things matter. Unfortunately, one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational, logical thinking, as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown. So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations. I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed. We all are going to fail now and then. The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be, to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage, or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place. Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal, when I got back from my trip, I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door, with a key to the front door in it, an easy to remember combination. And I have to admit, I still have piles of mail that haven't been sorted, and piles of emails that I haven't gone through. So I'm not completely organized, but I see organization as a gradual process, and I'm getting there. Thank you very much."
Reprogramming your brain to overcome fear,Olympia LePoint,"Ten, nine, eight, seven - pressures are good -  six, five, four, three - valve timing nominal -  two, one, we're good to go; lift off!  5,000 miles, no excessive vibrations.  10,000 miles, temperatures are good.  15,000 miles, 17,000 miles -  yes, we are in outer space!  (Cheers) (Applause)  That was me -  an award-winning rocket scientist sitting in Mission Control.  I helped successfully launch  Discovery, Columbia, Atlantis, and Endeavour space shuttles.  I used ... Thank you.  (Applause) (Cheers)  I used mathematics and science  to calculate the probability of catastrophic explosion  within the space shuttle's flight.  In all, I helped launch with a great team of people  28 spatial missions into outer space.  (Applause) (Cheers)  Now, I can stand here  and tell you how great it was to launch for the Mission Control.  I can tell you how it was like  to sign off and authorize multimillion-dollar engine tests,  but I'm not.  I can tell you how great it is to be an author and a TV host now,  but I'm not.  Rather, I'm going to talk about you and me,  and what comes in our mind in the middle of challenges:  fear.  What have you always wanted to do in life?  Do you want to be a multimillion-dollar business owner?  Do you want to be the first in your family to graduate from college?  Do you want to start a family?  For me, I always wanted to be a rocket scientist,  but obstacle and roadblocks came into my path  where I questioned whether or not I'd be able to do it.  The truth is this:  If we do not have a way to reprogram our minds,  to overcome fear,  we will never be successful at our own specific missions in life.  But there's good news.  I have personally found,  I have personally devised a three-step method to overcome fear  and reprogram the brain using three key decisions,  and I'm going to share them with you, today.  The first decision is this:  You must name and reject your fear.  You must name and reject your fear.  Now, the easiest way for me to tell you about all these three decisions  is to take you back in my life,  and to share with you what happened with me  so you have a better idea of how to use these three decisions.  And it started when I was six years old, and I'll never forget that day.  I went on a field trip to the jet propulsion laboratory,  and there it was wonderful.  I remember seeing these big engines and these jets,  and we went to their mission control room,  and it was amazing.  I saw these big TV screens on the wall  and these red plush chairs,  and I also saw pictures of men launching rockets,  and I said to myself, ""I want to be just like those men.""  Now, I'm not quite sure if you've noticed,  I wear stilettos and skirts;  I am definitely a woman ...  (Applause) (Cheers)  and that didn't stop me, I wanted to be just like these men.  But obstacles came into my path.  Now, here I am, 10 years old, in the middle of a fifth-grade class,  and right next to me is a boy who is also 10,  and he has been recruited into a gang.  He and I get into arguments, quite regularly,  because frankly, I don't know the power of my words at this age.  And he wears this ring on his finger that he files down  so it acts just like a knife.  And so one day, in a heated argument,  he takes this ring,  and he socks me right under my eye.  Now, being a champion, an Olympian,  I stand up to defend myself and everything goes blank.  I cannot see one thing.  I am later rushed to the hospital,  and I have five layers of stitches placed on my face,  and the surgeon tells me I'm lucky;  had it been any higher, I would have lost my eye.  Now, I am pulled out of school for months.  Where right next door, there's a crack house,  and I see people getting high on the outside of my bedroom window.  And our mother has us sleep in the bed in a certain direction  so if the bullets came through the house,  if it came through the walls,  it would hit our feet first and not our head.  So in the middle of downtown Los Angeles,  in poverty, face disfigured,  and I want to be a rocket scientist.  Next, I am placed into another school,  where I fail algebra, then I fail geometry.  Then I go to a performing arts school, and I fail chemistry,  then make a D in calculus ...  Then a blessing occurs.  There's this man - he's a teacher -  and he says that if anybody wants help  for their AP Calculus exam, he would tutor them for free.  So I jump at this opportunity,  and I catch the bus two hours each way  just to sit with his man for one hour.  And I remember looking at the information,  and I remember thinking,  ""Wait,  I can get this!  I may not understand it now but I will;  I'm not going to let failures stop me.""  And that was the first time  I learned to name and reject my fear.  It would be a beautiful story  if I told you that I took the AP Calculus exam and passed it,  but no, I failed it miserably.  (Laughter)  But what I learned  is that process to invest in myself and others in education.  I took those skills and graduated at the age of 16 from high school,  and then later applied those skills to the University I attended,  where I tutored thousands of people in mathematics  through educational group programs.  And I and other people learned to name and reject their fear,  and I, fortunately, was able to be one out of top five graduates  out of a 6,500 graduating class.  You must name your fear and reject it.  (Applause)  The second decision is this:  You must reprogram your brain with different thoughts.  You must reprogram your brain with different thoughts.  You know how you have a computer and it may be infected with a virus,  you have to take the virus off the computer  and reboot it so it operates correctly?  Well, our brains are the exact same way.  What we have to do is take the virus out  which is called fear.  And I learned this  my first couple of months working as a rocket scientist.  Now, I'm going to share a secret with you.  When I first started in rocket science, I was completely intimidated.  I remember going inside this room,  and there was around 200 people in this room,  and I remember looking around, and I was the only woman.  And then I remember looking around again,  and everyone was at least 20 years older than I was.  And I was hearing all these words I didn't know.  Beads of sweat would come down my forehead as I was hearing:  SSME, ITAR, RP-1, ISP;  I didn't know what any of this was,  and that fear started coming into my brain again.  And I didn't know whether or not  I'd be able to make a significant difference.  Then, a couple of weeks later, I had my second epiphany.  I remember going into this room, and then I realized,  ""Wait, I'm educated,  and I work hard at everything I do.  I may not be able to make a significant difference now, but I will.""  So that's what I did.  I literally told myself, ""I'm going to make a big difference here.""  And I found mentors to show me what SSME meant,  which was the Space Shuttle Main Engine.  The Space Shuttle Main Engine was huge.  I find out where every single duct,  line, weld, tube, every valve was placed,  enough so that I was able to help redesign new engines  and sit in Mission Control.  This work allowed me to become one of the youngest engineers of the year.  You must reprogram your brain with different thoughts.  And the last decision is this.  The last decision is this:  You must rebuild your brain,  you must rebuild the neurons in your brain, by taking action.  Now, we've all been there.  We've had to lose weight, we've had to get in shape,  and it's not enough to simply say,  ""All right, I'm going to get in shape,"" and then you sit on your couch.  You've got to go to the gym, you've got to climb those stairs,  you've got to get on a bike,  you've got to do something to activate your muscles  so you lose weight.  Well, our brains are the exact same way.  The way that we exercise our brain  is by taking action in direct opposition to our fear.  In every single one of these cases,  I learned something specific.  I and other people were suffering from what I have personally coined as:  ""mathphobia.""  (Laughter)  Mathphobia is a severe fear that happens in the reptilian part of the brain,  that shuts off the frontal brain lobes,  rendering someone completely paralyzed when it comes to problem-solving.  Anytime someone has fear,  the problem-solving is completely turned off.  But when we take action in direct opposition from our fear,  something amazing happens.  Neuron transmitters are created and built within our brain, turning off fear,  creating pathways to fire off our frontal brain lobes.  And when our frontal brain lobes fire off, we're able to do great things.  And I recognized this after I left rocket science.  When I left rocket science,  I was offered a prestigious position for a banking institution,  only to recognize that I loved science and education far more.  So I left banking, and I decided to be a part-time mathematics professor.  But, when I did that, the entire United States economy tanked.  Nobody was hiring.  And here I was underemployed, struggling to pay my bills,  and I almost let fear stop me again.  But this time, I was armed with all these experiences,  and something different happened this time.  I remember sitting there, thinking, ""What am I going to do?""  And then I had my latest realization:  ""Wait, I'm talented.  If no one is hiring, why not hire myself?""  So that's what I did.  (Laughter)  I hired myself;  I created my own educational entertainment company.  First, I created my website  with all the cool, different science, technology, engineering, and math videos.  Then, what I did was form the company -  specifically, I had to find out the difference  between an S-corporation and a C-corporation.  Next, what I did is I hired tutors;  then I wrote a book;  now my team and I are creating educational TV shows  for network programming.  I didn't know how to do any of this,  but in that process of learning to become a beginner again,  what I was doing is  turning off the fear in my own head,  creating neuron transmitters in my own brain, firing my frontal lobes,  allowing myself to be creative and creating opportunities.  So, if there's one thing I want you to remember today it's this:  You can reprogram your brain to override fear,  if you name and reject your fear,  reprogram your brain with different thoughts,  and take action in direct opposition to your fear.  If you do all these three things,  guess what?  You can do anything you set your mind to,  even become a rocket scientist."
Letting go of expectations,Heather Marshall,I am here to help you do even more unzipping of your minds and of your hearts Roxie clay came out here and challenged your expectations and I'm going to ask you to unzip and let your expectations fall out and push them aside all together because they're holding you back expectations are those lists of things What are expectations we build up that tell us how things should be they keep us feeling safe and they also often prevent us from being fully present in our lives and from living to our highest potential so I'm going to tell you about my journey away from expectation which also turned out to be a journey toward self empowerment and hope and then how it might apply to your relationships as well I first learned about the power of letting go of expectation on my journey back to my natural family my birth family I'm adopted and my adoption is a fairly standard post World War two story in Great Britain my natural parents live next door to each other in a small town near the east coast of Scotland and when they finished high school they went to the west of Scotland to Glasgow a whopping 38 miles away my father went to Heathers story Glasgow University my mother went to nursing school and when she became pregnant they decided they were going to get married but they were going to wait and tell their families when they went home on Christmas break so they expected to end that year by becoming a family that was December 1966 what they got instead was a tearful break up outside my father's garage from my mother that was followed by a stay at a mothering home a daughter who left the hospital before she did a bill for my foster care and ultimately my adoption my father paid penance by working as a bricklayer for a year before he to University in Edinburgh they never saw each other again whatever expectations they had were Letting go of expectations shattered on top of that they were told that they should be grateful privileged that they had a chance to redeem themselves and move on this is all pretty standard stuff for that time in place and I'm telling you this because I want to note that although my parents learned not to expect in the wake of our separation this is not the productive kind of letting go the kind of letting go that they learned is rooted in shame and in punishment there isn't any hope in it it's about shutting down and what I would like us to do today is learn how to let go and open up so fast-forward 18 years from that tearful breakup in the garage my adoptive father my dad had made it clear that he would totally understand if I wanted to go and find my natural family this is a lot easier in Scotland than it is here they don't alter birth certificates the adoptee has the rights to all the records so I took myself off to the House of Records in Edinburgh and got hold of my birth certificate it had my birth name my mother's name her then address it took me another 18 years to decide to search the lead up to that would take another TEDTalk or two mostly something had shifted inside me on a trip back in 2003 I walked past the house listed on the birth certificate and I just couldn't let it go after that I was led entirely by my gut I kind of had to be adoptees are less than 5% of the population only a few of assert and only a fraction of the people who search actually wind up being in reunion there aren't enough of us for there to be a guidebook and for me this turned out to be a good thing it did help that I had had my own child my first child in somewhat similar circumstances to my own birth it also helped that I knew two other friends who were adoptees who were in reunion they had gone into the reunion with a litany of expectations one friend was in a relationship with her natural father that could best be termed as clandestine the other friend's father drank himself into ICU the first time they met their relationships with all their natural families were fraught to say the least so I went in with an awareness of the Letting go of hope risks I looked clearly at the risks and I decided to go ahead I went in also trying to pare back to what I really hoped without the expectation and what I hoped was to find my natural mother I wanted to know where I came from yes part of me did want the Oprah style reunion you know the one where you go and the whole gigantic attractive successful natural family welcomes the adoptee on whom they've been waiting their whole lives but I did not go expecting it I pared back and back to what was driving the hope I knew I had to hang on to that I knew I had to be whole and I had to expect nothing when I felt ready to do that I contacted birth link in Scotland this is a nonprofit agency that helps adoptees and their families connect with each other I put my name on the list for a searcher that takes some months so in the waiting time I searched more deeply within myself I asked myself all kinds of odd questions what would I do if I found my mother and she was dying and needed my help what would I make of it if I found her and she was alcoholic obese if she was destitute a retired prostitute and I realized that anything that would bother me deeply would do so because I already saw it as a weakness in myself in other words anything I might want her to change was really something I wanted to change in myself I believe this is also called owning your own stuff Owning your own stuff also talk to my brother he's also adopted and he said look Heather the only thing you really have to worry about is if you go to meet her and she comes to the door with her bags packed and goes alright darling we are we going cuz she thinks she's moving in with you anything else you can just run away from Stuart is often good for a little bit of comedy with some truth embedded and he was right either one of us could end the relationship at any moment and isn't that the case with all our relationships we behave as though in our relationships especially our significant ones we behave as though we're operating with some kind of a relationship union like a pipe fitters union that's going to uphold our expectation contract but the truth is relationships live in a right-to-work state any party and sometimes a third party like sudden death can end the contract with no notice and no cause and that is a scary truth to face but as with any other No guidebook truth all the expectation in the world can't stop it what I knew what my net natural parents and I had lived for nearly four decades before we came face-to-face is that expectation doesn't guarantee you a thing so I entered the relationship knowing the risks I entered the relationship owning what I brought I entered the relationship without that guidebook and here's the good thing about there not being a guidebook there aren't any articles about what a good reunion looks like like the articles you read that imply that all the other married couples have more sex than you the skinny woman next door eats cherry pie for breakfast the other guy's business makes more money than yours and it's more fun to work there all the things that build up our expectations and they record chances of honoring what's right in front of us so when I entered the relationship in this Rest in way what I found that I was able to really rest in and notice small moments and to take joy there I noticed for instance the grain of my mother's freckled hand wrapped around her mug of tea the first time we met I got to experience her with the surest sureness of adulthood and the heart of a child I didn't have my expectation checklist running through my head that's what expectations do they tend to run through our head act like a third party in our relationship constantly vying for our attention and that feels okay when things match up but even then we've stepped away from the moment and the relationship to check in with them and when things don't measure up then we really go aside we start talking to expectation asking it for affirmation he should have brought me flowers shouldn't he she should run those meetings on time and our expectation list says oh yes honey you are right get back in there and make them do it your way so you keep asking and asking and getting grumpier and grumpier when things don't measure up if you've asked a couple of times and you haven't gotten the response you wanted you're probably not going to get it and in that stepping away to measure up with expectation you've missed the moment and the relationship as it unfolded that might have offered a path forward and even when the worst thing happens when your expectations aren't met and another path forward isn't on offer you're then resting in the truth and you can choose to move yourself forward from the truth of that relationship in that moment expectation does not stop painful stuff from happening it just blames it on somebody else what expectations do is pull us out of the moment they hold us in an infinite loop of false possibility so I challenge you today to free yourself from this loop of false possibility before you leave this building this afternoon think of one relationship that has one unfulfilled expectation in it let the expectation go search yourself own your stuff commit to entering your next interaction in that relationship without the expectation hanging on to some hope and then just allowing yourself to fully rest in the reality of the moment whatever needs or wants you might have it's possible that those can be met in some other way but not by this person at this moment settle your heart to that and then move yourself forward I think you'll find that if you can be brave enough to rest in reality human and flawed and possibly beautiful reality it will take you places better than you've ever dared to expect
My flight from an arranged marriage,Sabatina James,"It was not a day like any other in her life a 17 years old girl standing alone in the middle of the room 20 eyes staring at her with severe looks demanding a response Hey answer is short and simple no that moment changed the rest of her life she was beaten abused threatened and kept enclosed in a Quranic madrasa even her own family plotted against her there was no escape nowhere to flee if you know wondering why I'm telling you the story it's because this is my story I was born in Pakistan in a small village called Bidar I lived there with my two brothers with my sister and my mother when I was 10 years old my father brought us to Austria where he already lived and the freedom that I experienced in the West it was both on the one hand very exciting and fascinating on the other hand shocking I asked myself questions like why is my neighbor not married but having kids still alive but although I had these questions I knew that I don't have to adjust to these people's lifestyle this is how my mother used to call them but over the years I realized that in order to be accepted by my Austrian classmates I had to integrate to their culture to some extent so my problem started when I was fifteen years old I loved my new life the lipstick and the jeans make of and my parents didn't they didn't want me to adjust to the western lifestyle because for them the Western culture was evil and we were in Europe only to be educated and to go to school so we fought about swimming lessons we fought about acting classes which my father thought were only for prostitutes and when my mother found out that I had a boyfriend in school and had already kissed him she beated me up so brutally that social services had to intervene in traditional Islamic families like in mind we are not accepted as daughters we are seen as a source of honor and it's not the father's who are mostly to blame it's the mothers and I think this is even much worse because if your mother beats you and abuses you you lose your anchor and when my mother was my age she was settling into an arranged marriage and she thought it was time for me to do the same but I refused to marry my cousin in Pakistan that they had chosen for me that was extremely shaming and embarrassing for my parents they lost their face in the Pakistani community and so they wanted to restore the family's honour and tricked me with a holiday to my relatives in Pakistan what happened when we got there I already told you at the beginning but it even got worse when my father threatened me with death when I left Islam and converted to Christianity I fled to Germany in 2004 with the decision to help girls and women who in order to be free lose their families and have death threats on their lives we help those victims of honour based violence year 5,000 women are killed by their fathers and brothers in the name of Honor we give those women that dignity we help them find channel shelters give them legal advice and since 2006 I'm under police protection in Germany I rarely go out alone and so I have fought for my freedom and pay a very high price but if you are now asking yourself why was it really worth it my answer is short and simple yes thank you"
The impact of divorce on children,Tamara D. Afifi,A few days ago I told my students I was going to be giving a TED Talk and they had two responses the first was that is super cool right so would you agree super cool right woohoo yeah so I went from being kind of the geeky Professor to still being a geeky Professor but being able to do something really cool um the second reaction was um we want our voices to be heard and so what I did was um I just asked them for a minute and a half just to take out a sheet of paper and I said I want you to write down something you know if there is anything that you would change about the way your parents communicated when you were growing up and the second question I said was I want you to also thinking think about something that you appreciate about the way they communicated with you or with each other growing up and this was one of the response I mean keep in mind this was written in a minute and a half my parents never got a divorce but I always wish they had even when they were both cheating on one another to get back at each other or when Child Services got involved when all the friends and family encouraged them to end it they still held on now I'm 19 and scared to believe that anything lasts forever every relationship I go into I constantly remind myself that in a month or a year or whatever I'll lose them I wish my parents had just ended it back when me and my brothers were little that they hadn't made me feel like their Love Hate relationship with each other was more important than us however they always reminded us that we were loved and that we mattered Forever and Always and we still stayed strong when it really mattered I love them both now imagine you know and this was Anonymous so collecting these and then kind of sifting through them after class and seeing that you know and then I you know I kept sifting through thinking you know and there were a bunch of them that were really sad cases the majority were super positive let's keep that in mind you know but it really made me think as a professor you know looking across in my students um I was kind of dumbfounded because I you know talked about divorce for in Conflict for like a class period and a half not once did it ever occur to me that a student was feeling that inside and I think a lot of parents face a similar situation where they look at their child and they think their child is okay and most children are but inside they might be feeling something very different and they don't talk about it so parents just don't know so today I want to give Children of Divorce a voice so like I said I don't have any fancy PowerPoint slides I just have their voices and some research thrown in um in particular I want you to see Impact of divorce Through The Eyes Of The Adolescents and young adults who've experienced it and I often get asked the question so what impact does divorce have on children and my answer is always it depends um it depends upon a host of complex um circumstances and situations and children really vary in terms of how they respond to a divorce some children actually Faire a lot better if they're removed from a really conflicted turbulent environment and other children um Fair really poorly and then other children aren't affected aren't affected at all divorce does have for most children a short-term impact most Children of Divorce suffer from lower self-esteem anxiety depression less quality contact with their parents um their standard of living decreases and a lot of times you know these short-term effects actually linger into adulthood and have long-term effects you know some children continue to have um psychological difficulties um Children of Divorce on average um tend to have um less satisfied relationships with their parents later in in life they have more difficulty in their romantic relationships and they're much more likely to get divorced themselves and at Effect sizes this point in the lecture this the children who are from divorced families the students want to get out and walk out because it's like great I'm screwed um is there hope and yes there is because research actually shows that the differences or the effect sizes between Children of Divorce and children of parents who stay married are very small primarily because there's a lot of variance and how people how children respond to divorce but what's really interesting paulato who's a sociologist and one of my mentors actually showed that these effect sizes actually these differences might be getting bigger not smaller he did um a meta analysis where he looked at hundreds of studies from the children whose parents were divorced in the 70s and 80s and 90s um and it was really high the effect of divorce on children in the 70s decreased in the 80s and increased in the 90s again so it's kind of perplexing divorce is common it's less stigmatized so why would the differences between divorce children of divorce and non-divorced families be increasing you know and apart one of his Reasons for divorce you know one of his suggestions was well maybe it's because the reasons for divorce are different than they used to be when people got divorced in the 1970s because there was a really bad marriage right you know adultery all these other things and they really needed to get out of it today people are getting divorced for personal happiness and that could really bother children right that's not enough um people are getting divorced too easily when I ask my students well what do you think they actually argue it's because children are closer to their parents now than they ever have been when I think about my generation and I just turned 40 I'm going to admit it on the web W just turned 40 right but I think my generation and older you know we talk to our parents like on a Sunday night once a week and that's good you know good kid K and we say hi and you know have good relationships but those of you who are college students how many of you um talk to your parents once a day or once every other day yeah the vast majority whenever my I ask my students you know classes of a hundred 90% of them talk to their parents at least once a day text messaging the phone how what whatever they use they talk to their parents a lot and they feel extremely close to them times are changing partially due to technology and other things but it might mean that when divorce happens because they're so close to their parents it hurts them more so setting that aside though those effect sizes those differences are still very small so divorce matters but what I want you to remember today is this point there's one variable that determines more than any other how well children function after divorce and that's parents conflict I Parents conflict would say the that the most profound finding on divorce in the past four decades is that parents conflict is more important than divorce per se in predicting how well children function in fact children whose parents have a lot of conflict and who stay married those are the children that actually have the most difficulty psychologically and have the most difficulty establishing satisfying relationships later in life not the children necessarily whose parents divorce it's not so much about the divorce as it is how parents relate to each other you know most people who've been married for 50 years are happily married thank goodness but there's a subgroup of those people who've been married forever who really just don't like each other it's sarcastic I know it's dark but I kind of wish there was a special section of the Hallmark store for them you know what I mean cuz like H workers always like so flowery and beautiful but there should be like a card that says you've been married for 50 years but have you been happy um again dark I know um but there are those subgroup of people who simply don't believe in divorce and I'm not saying that you should go out and get a divorce I'm not an advocate of divorce it's really painful and people I do think people get divorced way too easily um but parents also need to know that the way that they fight affects their children's bodies I remember a long time ago I was doing field research and went into family's homes and I was spending anywhere from 4 to 7 hours in our home and I was interviewing and surveying you know all the kids and the parents everybody in the home and I remember sitting on a couch um with a child Nate was 12 years old sitting on the couch with him and asking him about his parents divorce and I remember him saying you know his stomach hurt a lot at night his stomach would hurt and then he would go to school and his stomach would still hurt he had a hard time concentrating and he was talking about how his parents fought a lot and then I asked him well do you talk to your parents about their fighting it's like and he said no I don't ever talk to them about it because if I bring it up it makes the conflict worse um that defining moment that had a big impact on my research I walked away from that interaction with that child thinking I got to do something different other than self-reports you know or surveys to try and show parents look the way that you're fighting is affecting your children bodies and from that point forward I began to look at physiology and children's physical physiological reactions to their parents conflict and other types of communication patterns um through things like um their heart rates there G galvanic skin response or their sweat or arousal and looking at stress hormones and so you know when your body is stressed it your brain tells the rest of your body to emit hormones like cortisol so we take people's spit Stress hormones you can tell a lot of things through a person's spit although sometimes people don't want to give us their spit they're a little bit hesitant because they're like are you cloning me what are you going to do with this uh DNA um you can actually tell a person's DNA but um we look at stress hormones because you can tell from just from someone's spit how stressed their body is um and so for example we bring parents and Adolescence into the lab we sit them on a couch and then we have them talk about something stressful about the parents relationship and these are parents and kids from divorced and non-divorced families um and then we take their spit before the interaction and at three or four times after the interaction to look at how their body is responding when they're talking about something stressful related to the parents um relationship and what we found for example is that parents that have really good communication skills they don't have very much conflict they're supportive they're competent in the way that they communicate either affectionate um it doesn't really stress out kids right very much that type of interaction you know they stress out a little bit get a little bit anxious and then they their bodies are able to calm down really quickly doesn't matter whether their parents are divorced or not the kids that have the most difficulty are the ones whose parents have a lot of conflict who are still married those kids after that type of an interaction or anxiety levels are like you're bouncing a super ball in this room their bodies are less able to calm down after an interaction like that now that's just one interaction now imagine if your parents are chronically fighting you know what that can do inside to a child's body now Children of Divorce Delayed reaction whose parents had a lot of conflict also reacted they had a delayed reaction but then they were able to come down again the other group of children that tend to have a really hard time with their parents divorce are the ones who never see it coming um so let me give you kind of an extreme example um a young woman came up to me after a class one day and she was really bothered by that it was actually after the lecture on divorce I tend to bother people so you know she hand her hands are all sweaty I get that comment a lot too and make people all sweaty um so she comes up to me after class and she's like you know I thought my parents had the perfect marriage and my friends always told me your parents have the perfect marriage so she went off to college and her parents sprung a divorce on her and that's actually not all that uncommon um and then she said you know and my mom is my best friend and so my mom confided in me that she was cheating on my dad but that my dad didn't know and she said should I continue to see this other person or should I break up with your father now you can imagine what that would do to a person's What should I do body so she said Professor aifi what should I do you know I was like um you know you think I'm nervous now wow like then I was like a I you know and I actually said two things I said one I'm really sorry that you're in that situation number two I said why do you know this information I said that's a lot of weight for a college student to have that type of information and I said you know what you should be worried about what you're going to wear in Friday night you should be worried about getting good grades you should be worried about going out with your friends and what type of career you might have instead she was worried day in and day out every minute of the of the day what are my parents going to do her mom and they have a really close relationship but parents have to be very careful so that that doesn't tip over right so their child doesn't become their Confidant their best friend another parent and that's a apply slope and I think that's a generational difference as well that we're facing so that closeness is a good you know is a good thing but she felt caught between her parents that's what really bothers adolescence in and young adults is when they feel caught or torn between their parents when children feel caught or torn between their parents they're tugged between different loyalties they love both of their parents right so they're trying to maintain these relationships and defend their parents in the presence parent in the presence of the other children feel torn when their par when their parents um make them mediators when they give them they make them messengers of information they ask them to relay information they use inappropriate disclosures and it can be very small thing so for example the dad says um can you just remind your mom Child feeling caught that you have a dentist appointment on Tuesday easy right the child goes to the mom dad said I have a dentist appointment on Tuesday and the mom's like why didn't your dad just tell me that like why doesn't your father ever talk to me you tell your father he needs to talk to me more it was a simple task turns into a child feeling caught um unfortunately when children feel caught what they tend to do because it creates dissonance anxiety in their brains right so but unfortunately the way that they settle that dissonance is by forming an alliance with one parent against the other and they don't mean to do it it's just easier unfortunately so they might maintain a really close relationship with one parent but they lose the connection with the other I don't know how many quotes I got from students in these classes that said because of that one thing I lost a relationship with my mom or dad for three years and it's never been the same so how else do children respond when they feel caught they avoid they don't want to talk about it right so when they avoid the parents don't realize it exists very much so they keep on talking Vicious cycle right and the child keeps on avoiding so it's a vicious cycle sometimes the second reaction that they have is they become aggressive right they mimic their parents' conflict in return the third thing they do is they directly confront their parents and say look like you need to keep me out of this and that actually is the most effective for them but they have to say it numerous times but that only comes with age because we tell our children don't talk back to your parents Confrontation right so they're not going to talk back to their parents usually but as they age they increase in their competence and their ability to um or they gain efficacy they think they now have the ability to tell their parents like look don't put me in the middle of it so I wanted to end on a positive note because I said I would what can parents do that's the big question and I felt this talk today was really important because I want to give parents efficacy what can they do how can I feel like I can do something so that I so that my children don't get put in the middle and I think parents feel very frustrated because they feel like they can control their own actions but they can't control the bad behavior of the other parent um well the first thing you need to do is if you can cooperate try and create um rules between each other for how you're going to communicate to each other and to your children and try to co-parent together that's the best alternative but if you've tried and tried and tried and that's not working the parent continues to badmouth you don't engage let go focus on your own behavior because time and time again adolescence and young adults will tell you I respected that I could see what was going on and my mom or my dad didn't go there you know when our I said we had two little girls one six and one eight they you know they squabble like sisters do siblings do so like one will come to Emotions me and you know Mom my sister keeps picking on me and I say well what would happen if you didn't talk to her back you know really what would happen if you didn't engage just don't fight back she's gonna get bored right same thing happens with adults if you don't engage your behavior can actually affect the other Behavior because they're not it's not a game anymore the second thing is to figure out where the emotions are coming from Robert Emery who was a clinician and a researcher who studies divorce said you know sometimes parents former spouses are really angry at each other because they hate each other and sometimes they're really angry at each other because they still love each other so you have to figure out why are you so angry um and then you have to figure out how to redefine your relationship you're no longer married to each other you're co-parents so trying to figure out how can go from spouses to co-parents um effectively and the last thing that I would recommend is trying to take away some of the emotion in conflict in Conclusion general people tend to say the worst things that they regret when they're highly emotional highly angry highly sad so try and diffuse some of the emotions something very simple for example is to email the parent instead of talking to them face to face so much or via the phone email has its own issues but it does tend to diffuse emotion and the last and final point that I wanted to make to parents the most important thing you can do is to listen to your child's voice they may not say anything but try and put yourself in your child's shoes and think of the long-term impact that this would have and listen to their inner voice thank you 
Draw your future,Patti Dobrowoslki,"Maya Angelou once said, ""A solitary fantasy can transform a million realities."" What dream or vision do you want to turn into reality? I always wanted to go into business for myself. I could be a consultant. I'm going to go gluten free, right after I eat that last piece of chocolate cake. (Laughter) You know, one day I'm going to stand up to that crabby boss. I look good on paper, I should feel great. I just know there's more. You know it because you feel it. You lie awake at night. You talk about your dreams with your partner and your friends, but more often than not, you continue to do those same behaviors that keep you from making the change. You ask yourself, ""How can I make it happen?"" Research shows, the odds against you making a change in your life -- -- 9 to 1. 9 to 1, even if you're facing a life-threatening illness. But let me show you how to beat those odds. You can live the life you desire. It's right there in front of you. But in order to achieve it, you must first see it, then believe it, and then you must graciously ask and train your brain to help you execute your vision. So how do we see our vision? Through a picture. A picture can create movement. A picture... can unite nations, a picture can pull at your heart and fill you with a deep desire to do something. At Roche Pharmaceutical, the president asked us to create a picture of his vision. Prior to having one, less than 40 percent of the employees understood the company's vision and strategy. After seeing this picture, 96 percent understood it, and 84 percent understood how what they did everyday align to that picture. So how can you use a picture to get what you want? By simply drawing one. You don't have to be an artist or know how to draw. As naive as your drawings might be, when you draw where you are, your current state, and where you want to be, your desired new reality. Suddenly, you have a road map for change. So what is your current state? Well, let's say you're Joe. Joe has a good job. Joe has a lovely wife, Amy. Joe makes good money, but like many of us, Joe wants more from life. And he'd like to get rid of a couple of things. Maybe that intense workload, maybe that negative boss. Maybe Joe has a higher purpose; he's just not sure how to get there. So, now, Joe's current state is visual. We remember things better when they're attached to a picture. 65 percent better to be exact. So now let's imagine that Joe wants to change something in his current state. He wants to build that desired new reality that he dreams about. In order for Joe to freely dream, he must first... ...trick his brain. Because the left side of your brain, as you know, houses the critic, who is forever trying to keep you safe from harm, make sure you don't do anything dangerous or stupid. So let's have Joe tell the critic that he's just going to use his imagination. Using your imagination activates the right side of your brain, which makes you creative and filled with possibility. So now, let's dream Joe's new life. In the best case scenario, one year from today, what is Joe's life like? Hey, Joe has a new job. Great. Joe has a new boss, himself. Joe has a couple of great collaborators, and Joe is just bursting with creativity and ideas, and all of those things we dream about. Connection, and purpose, and freedom, and love. Now I'm drawing this picture as the favor to Joe today. But in real life, he'd have to draw his own picture. Because he can't afford me. (Laughter) Actually, because you get the most power when you paint your own picture. So now, Joe has his drawing, so now he's got to soak it in. He has to fill it with color. He has to fill it with emotion. He has to get inside of it, as if he's on the inside, looking out. Your brain actually emits serotonin and Oxytocin when you draw and dream. So you feel happy. Capable, creative. You feel cool. So now, we have Joe's current state and Joe's desired new reality. So how can Joe get from here to there in just three bold steps? Three bold steps? If I knew how to get from here to there in three bold steps, I would have done it 25 years ago when I had a mullet. (Laughter) Here is where the magic begins. Your brain knows you. It's cataloged everything you've ever seen, heard, experienced, real, or imagined. You just have to ask it to put the pieces together for you. It as simple as that. We live in a three-dimensional world, but the light falls on the retina in a two-dimensional fashion, and the brain, it has to cope with it. So how does it deal with this extra dimension? It guesses. It guesses! And just as it can guess where your cup of coffee is when it goes to pick it up, it can correctly guess what the three bold steps are that you should take. All you have to do is look at your picture and then close your eyes. This allows the brain to recycle what it sees and reconstruct it, add to it everything you've ever seen, heard, experienced, or fantasized about, and then it will serve you up with the best possible solution. If you just relax and you ask it, now what's the boldest thing I could do to get from here to there? Boom, immediately it will tell you. See it, believe it, act on it. Now, the danger is, if any of those three bold steps are too scary, this instinctual rational side of your brain is going to try to talk you out of this. Oh, no, no, no, I don't want to do that... Oh, that desk it's not too small, my legs aren't cramped under there. Oh, 20,000 a year, oh, that's a decent salary. Oh, that boss, he's not that mean to me. You know what, I'm just going to stay right here. I feel really comfortable here. So how can you get yourself to do the boldest thing? By drawing the most compelling picture, so when you look here, you're in pain, it hurts. When you're here, you're ecstatic, it's fantastic, you're already living inside that connected and free life you drew. So, everyday, you get up, you soak in your picture, you step into the possibility, and this is the most important part, you act on it. You do one small thing. You call up that friend you know who started her own business, you ask her ""How did you do it?"" You ask Amy, ""Will you support me in my vision?"" You go to your boss and you ask him for a raise. And you become that one person out of ten to make change happen. Now, I put this template on your chairs, so that you can do for yourself what I just did for Joe. You've seen some fantastic ideas today that have inspired your dream. I dare you to draw that dream into that template. I double dare you to choose a symbol in your drawing that represents that desired new reality, take a picture of it with your phone and send it to us at TEDxRainier. Maya Angelou said, ""A solitary fantasy can transform a million realities."" Just three bold steps can transform one reality, yours. Thank you."
Happiness is all in your mind,Gen Kelsang Nyema,"Alright, my friends. Hello. (Audience) Hello. So I want to start off with a few questions. And I know a lot of other presenters have already asked you questions, and they've been kind of hard questions. But the questions I'm going to ask you are very, very simple. And I promise you'll be able to answer these. Alright, are you ready? For your first one? Okay. Your first questions is -- you don't have to answer out loud: Are you having a good day? Okay, got your answer? Alright. My second question for you is: Why? If you're having a good day, why are you having a good day? Or if you're having a bad day, why are you having a bad day? So I have one more question for you. This should be the easiest one of all. My last question is: Tomorrow, would you rather have a good day, or would you rather have a bad day? Do you have your answer for that one? What about the day after tomorrow? What about Sunday? Let's see. Yeah, that's right. Tomorrow's Saturday. Sunday. How about Monday? Would you like to have a good day or a bad day on Monday? Tuesday? Wednesday? Thursday? Friday? This time next week? A good day or a bad day? So that last question, like I said, is probably the easiest one for us to answer, because we know the answer to that, don't we? We want to have a good day, everyday. Did anyone in the room answer, ""Yes, I want to have a bad day on Monday""? Of course not. We all want to have a good day everyday. So this is really speaking to the type of happiness that we all wish for in our heart of hearts. We have a good day when we're happy, and we want to be happy everyday. There's never a day when we don't want to be happy. But whether or not we have good days or bad days really depends upon how we answered the second question. Do you remember the second question? What was the second question? ""Why?"" Why am I having a good day? Why am I having a bad day? So one thing that my teacher says -- his name is Geshe Kelsang Gyatso -- and he says that, ""Much of the time our mind is like a balloon in the wind, blown here and there by external circumstances."" Do you know that feeling? He says when things are going well, when they're going our way, we feel happy. But then if something goes wrong, for example, he says, ""If we're forced to work with a colleague that we dislike,"" but I'm sure none of you have colleagues you dislike, right? (Laughter) He says if we're forced to work with someone we dislike, or if something doesn't go our way, then our happy feeling disappears. So as long as our answer to the question ""why am I having a good day?"", or ""why am I having a bad day?"" Because you know, this is a question people ask us like, maybe when you get home today, someone will go, ""So how was that TED thing?"" ""Did you have a good day?"" And we'll say, ""Yeah, I did."" ""There's this lady, and she talked to us about how we need to be compassionate towards former inmates, and there's this performer who did this awesome beat-boxing thing with his mouth, you know, this person, and that person."" As long as our reasons for why we had a good day are a list of external conditions, then we're not going to have this stable happiness that we all want. Does that make sense to you? Because if that's what our happiness depends upon -- because we cannot control people and circumstances every single day -- then our happiness will be in the hands of others, won't it? It'll be at the whim of our circumstances. So if you really wish to have a good day everyday, we've got two things we need to do. So the first thing that we need to do is we need to stop outsourcing our happiness and outsourcing our unhappiness on the people and circumstances. In other words, we need to stop attributing our happiness to what's going on externally, and we need to stop blaming others, -- especially blaming others -- for our unhappiness. So for as long as we do that, as long as we're making it the job of people and circumstances to make us happy, or as long as we're making it their fault when we're unhappy, our happiness will be very unstable, and illusive. Our second job is to actively cultivate a source of peace and a source of happiness coming from inside our own mind. So here's something I want you to commit to memory. Are you ready? This is another line from one of my teacher's books, where he says, ""Happiness and unhappiness are states of mind; and therefore their real causes cannot be found outside the mind."" So if we have a peaceful state of mind, we will be happy regardless of people and circumstances. If our mind is unpeaceful or agitated, then even if we have very good circumstances, we'll find it impossible to be happy. So, in other words, it's not what is happening that is making us happy or unhappy; it is how we are responding to those things that determines whether we're happy or unhappy. It is what our state of mind is like that determines our happiness or unhappiness. So how are we going to do this? So we can all understand this intellectually. It's not rocket science, is it? It's not hard to understand. And maybe, to a certain extent, as I tell you these things, you're like, ""Yeah , I knew that already."" ""I knew that already."" But how do we actually do it? How do we actually cultivate this stable peace of mind that we can rely upon, regardless of the external circumstances? So this is really where meditation comes into play. And I would say I would need a whole other TED talk -- hint, hint -- (Laughter) in order to really do this subject of meditation justice. But for our purposes today, we can say that meditation is a mental action. It's the mental action of concentrating on a peaceful positive state of mind. If we do that, we concentrate on a peaceful positive state of mind, then we can say we're meditating, whether that's like this, right? See, actually, you don't know if I'm meditating or not, because I could be thinking about my grocery list. (Laughter) It's only meditation if I'm actually focusing on a positive peaceful state of mind. But the trick is, I can do it like this. This is called formal meditation. But we can also learn to do this all the time in our daily life. See, here's a perfect opportunity. (Laughter) We concentrate on a mind of patience. We're not disturbed, not unhappy. So why don't we try it now? Are you up for it? Just a short meditation. According to the clock, I've got three minutes left, so this is going to be a very brief one. But let's actually try it, let's try to tap into our own potential for a peaceful positive state of mind. So now, I'll ask you to just sit comfortably, and place your feet flat on the floor, and your hands within your lap. And then you can lightly close your eyes and become aware of the sensation of your breath, at the tip of your nose. And as you breathe out, you can imagine you're breathing out any agitation, any mental busyness, any frustration or unhappiness in your life. Breathing it all out, like dark smoke. And as you breathe in, you can imagine and believe that you're breathing in a clear, bright light, which is a very nature of inner peace. And you can imagine that this clear, bright light fills your entire body and mind. And for a few seconds, simply enjoy this inner peace coming from within. And now, as we finish, just be determined to bring this inner peace with you into the rest of your day to benefit yourself and others. So now, we rise from meditation. Thank you very much."
Learning from the voice in my head,Eleanor Longden,This is a story about a voice and a voice hearer and it begins with me as an anxious teenager leaving home to go to university now these were happy days at first I'd done well at school expectations for me were high and I eagerly entered the student life of lectures parties and traffic cone theft now underneath this veneer I was actually deeply unhappy and emotionally iner but I was skilled at hiding it and it was with considerable surprise when I was joined in my second test by a new presence a disembodied voice which calmly narrated everything I did in the third person she is reading she is going to a lecture she is leaving the room it was neutral benal oddly compan although I did notice it sometimes mirrored my own unexpressed emotion so for example if I was angry and had to hide it which I often did being very Adept concealing how I really felt then the voice sounded frustrated but otherwise it was NE a sinister nor disturbing now it was then that I made a fatal mistake and that I mentioned the voice to a friend and she was horrified her implication was that I should immediately seek medical help which I did and which proved to be mistake number two now I spent some time telling the campus GP about what I perceived to be the real problem anxiety low self-worth fears about the future and was met with bored indifference until I mentioned the voice upon which he dropped his pen swung around and began to question me me with a show of real interest and to be fair I was desperate for interest and help and I began to tell him about my strange commentator and I always wish at this point the voice had said she is digging her own grave I was referred to a psychiatrist who also took a grim view of the vo's presence subsequently interpreting everything I said through a lens of latent Insanity so for example I was part of a student TV station that broadcasts news bulletins around the campus and during the appointment which is running very late I said I'm sorry doctor I've got to go I'm reading the news at 6 now it's standing my medical records Ellena has delusions that she's a television news broadcaster now it was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me a hospital admission followed the first of many a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next and then worst of all a prolonged and toxic sense of hopelessness and despair about myself and my prospects that tormented me Beyond endurance and drained me through humiliation helplessness and loss of self-respect into a shadow of myself but having been encouraged to see The Voice not as an experience but as a symptom my fear and resistance towards it intensified and this essentially represented taking an aggressive stance against my own mind and in turn the voices increased One Voice became 12 and grew progressively menacing and hostile setting me bizarre tasks ordering me to harm myself as I grew increasingly demoralized and disempowered two years later and I had the whole frenzied repertoire terrifying voices grotesque Visions bizarre intractable delusions my mental health status had been a catalyst for verbal abuse discrimination and physical and sexual assault and I've been told by my psychiatrist Elena you would be better off with cancer because cancer is easier to cure than SK phrenia i' been labeled I'd been medicated and I'd been left and by now was so tormented by my voices that I attempted to drill a hole in my head in order to get them out now six minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized lonely place but together they forged a blend of Courage creativity integrity and an unshakable belief that my shattered self could become come healed and whole and crucially they help me to understand what I'd always suspected that my voices were a meaningful response to painful life events particularly childhood events and as such were not my enemies but a source of insights into solvable emotional problems and so ultimately I gathered together my splintered self each fragment represented by a different voice and I went back to Psychiatry only this time from the other side I was returned to study and gained the highest degree in Psychology that the university had ever given and one year later the highest Masters which I always say isn't bad for a Nutter in fact during in fact during uh my stats exam one of the voices actually dictated the answers which technically possibly count is [Laughter] [Applause] cheating thank you I worked in the NHS I spoke at conferences I published book chapters and academic papers and I argued and continued to do so that an important question in Psychiatry shouldn't be what's wrong with you but rather what's happened to you and all the while I listened to my voices with whom I'd finally learned to live with peace and respect and which in turn represented a growing sense of compassion acceptance and respect towards myself I'm now very proud to be part of the international hearing voices movement an initiative inspired by the work of Professor marus Roman Dr Sandra eer which locates voice hearing as a creative and ingenious survival strategy a sane reaction to insane circumstances not as an abstract symptom of illness to be endured but as a complex significant and meaningful experience to be explored as pet LaVine has said the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual Spirit to harness this innate capacity in this respect I would like the Ted audience to be aware of two things firstly that as members of society there is no greater honor than facilitating that process for someone and for survivors of distress and adversity that we remember what lies behind us and what lies ahead of us are small matters compared to what lies within us as a very wonderful doctor once said to me don't tell me what other people have told you about yourself tell me about you thank you oh
Compassion and Kindship,Fr Gregory Boyle,"Thank you very much it's a privilege to  be with you I I want to apologize some  of you have probably heard me talk  before it happens I was speaking at a  Foster Grandparents gathering some years  ago and I had spoken at it the summer  before they I don't know why they  invited me to summers in a row but after  the second talk a grandmother came up to  me I think she liked the talk she had  big tears in her eyes and she grabbed  both my hands and she said I heard you  last year it never gets better so kind  of kind of hoping she was miss speaking  there anyway thank you for your  attention you know anybody just wants  some attention especially folks on the  margins I had a homey a gang member a  step into my office the other day very  earnest 16 year old gang member standing  in front of my desk and he says look I  need your divided attention I said you  are in luck you know I suppose there's a  vision that brings you to a place like  this a theater for the day and it's a  vision of wanting to see the world  looking differently than it currently  looks the Prophet Habakkuk writes the  vision still has its time presses on to  fulfillment and it will not disappoint  and if it delays wait for it but nobody  wants to wait for too long we want to  make something happen and that's what I  want to suggest in the brief time I have  with you that what we all want to create  and form is the community of kinship  such that God in fact might recognize it  I suspect that mother Teresa diagnosed  the world's ills correctly when she  suggested that the problem in the world  is that we've just forgotten that we  belong to each other so how do we stand  against forgetting that how do we create  and imagine a circle of compassion and  then imagine nobody standing outside  that circle and to that end what we hope  to do all of us I think is to inch our  way out to the margins so that we can  stand with the poor and the power  Burlison the voiceless and that we can  stand with those whose dignity has been  denied with those whose burdens are more  than they can bear occasionally you get  very fortunate and blessed to be able to  stand with the easily despised and the  readily left out with the demonized so  that the demonizing will stop and with  the disposable so that the day will come  when we stop throwing people away I  suspect that if kinship was our goal we  would no longer be promoting justice we  would in fact be celebrating it for no  kinship no justice no kinship no peace  so for 25 years it's been the privilege  of my life to work with gang members and  they've taught me everything of value  really but especially in last couple of  years they taught me how to text and I'm  so grateful to them like I find that it  sure beats the heck out of actually  talking to people and so I'm pretty  dexterous at lol and oMG and bTW you  know and the homies have taught me a  new one Oh H n which apparently stands  for oh hell no and I've been using that  one quite a bit lately and so there I am  with two homies Manuel and bunch old  there older BOTS those who work in my at  homeboy industries we have 400 employees  there and guys been to prison and  tattooed they do a variety of things  they're going to help me give a talk in  Palm Desert at a high school and so we  meet at 9:00 we get in the car 15  minutes on the road Manuel's in the  front seat and he gets an incoming text  and he chuckles to himself I said what  is it he goes oh it's dumb is from  Snoopy back at the office  why he just seen Snoopy Snoopy gave me a  big hassle - as the day began and Snoopy  and Manuel worked together in the clock  in room where they clock in all our all  our workers it's a tough job I said well  what's he say oh gosh hang on it's dumb  a dog it's me snoops yeah they got my  ass locked up at County Jail  they're charging me with being the  ugliest vato in America you have to come  down right now show them they got the  wrong guy  well we died laughing you know and then  I realize that Manuel and Snoopy are  enemies rivals they used to shoot  bullets at each other now they shoot  text messages and there's a word for  that in the word is kinship how can we  achieve a certain kind of compassion  that stands in awe at what the poor have  to carry rather than stand in judgment  at how they carry it for the measure of  our compassion lies not in our service  of those on the margins but in our  willingness to see ourselves in kinship  with them and mutuality I was a great  privilege of my life to know SR Chavez  as a friend and I can remember once a  reporter had commented to him Wow these  farm workers they sure love you and Sesa  just shrugged and smiled and he says the  feeling's mutual and that's what we want  to achieve is this sense of mutuality  where we obliterate once and for all the  illusion that we're separate no us in  them just us for there's an idea that's  taken root in the world it's at the root  of all that's wrong with it and the idea  would be this that there just might be  lives out there that matter less than  other lives how do we stand against that  idea well homeboy Industries was born on  nearly 25 years ago when I was pastor of  the poorest parish in the city of Los  Angeles Dolores mission nestled in the  middle of to public housing projects  Pico gardens and Aliso village at the  time they comprised the largest grouping  of public housing West the Mississippi  we had eight gangs there half of those  gangs at war with the other half I  buried my first young person killed  because of the sadness in 1988 and I  buried my one hundred and eightieth some  months ago we did a lot of things  started a school and then a jobs program  and when we couldn't find enough jobs we  started our first business homeboy  bakery in 1992 a month later we started  homeboy tortillas in the Grand Central  Market not everything worked you know  I'll be the first to admit it homeboy  plumbing was not a huge success who knew  people didn't want gang rooms in their  homes I I did I did not see that coming  and now we didn't intend to do this but  we have backed our way into becoming the  largest gang intervention rehab and  re-entry Center in the country  so 15,000 folks a year walk through our  doors keep in mind there are 1,100 gangs  in LA County and 86,000 gang members and  so you name anything that might be  helpful we do it from curricular things  like anger management and parenting lots  and lots of mental health counselors  case managers job developers free tattoo  removal no place on the planet removes  more tattoos than we do we have a  designated clinic three laser machines  29 doctors 800 treatments a month and it  was all started because of a guy named  Frank who wandered out of Corcoran State  Prison two days out of prison and he  wanders into my office and he's sitting  in front of me and tattooed on his  forehead like a banner like a billboard  and pardon my french it says the  world yeah and he said you know I'm  having a hard time finding a job and I  say well but Frank you know maybe we  could put our heads together on this one  you know so anyway I found a doctor who  donated some time and little by little  we chipped away at his forehead and we  have our chips and salsas and all the  Ralphs and the food for less and we have  a homeboy diner the only place you can  get food in the city hall we're about to  move into the LA X American Airlines  terminal have put a restaurant there  homeboy bakery homeboy silkscreen  homeboy homegirl merchandise where we  sell our logo stuff we're in 24  different farmers markets we have the  solar panel installation training  program and homegirl cafe were women  with records young ladies from rival  gangs waitresses with attitude will  gladly take your order  last year you know at the cafe we had a  visit from Diane Keaton the  oscar-winning actress movie star Annie  Hall Godfather movies and she's there  with a regular guy who's there once a  week and her waitress this day is Glinda  and Glenda's a homegirl been there done  that tattooed been to prison the felon  the parolee she doesn't know who Diane  Keaton is and so she's taking her order  and Diane Keaton says what do you  recommend and Glinda rattles off the  three blood deals that she particularly  likes and and deinking says I'll have  that second one that sounds good and  then something dawns on Glinda exactly  that moment she says wait a minute I feel like I know you from somewhere like  maybe we've met and dine Keith decides  to deflect it humbly oh gosh I don't  know I suppose I have one of those faces  you know that people think they've seen  before and then Glinda goes no now I  know we were locked up together but that  just took my breath away when I heard it  and I don't believe we've had any  further Diane Keaton sighting since that  moment but suddenly kinship so quickly  oscar-winning actress attitudinal  waitress exactly what God had in mind  and if you'll permit me to speak for God  Jesus says it pretty clearly that you  may be one that's the whole thing that  you may be one that's the hope anyway  all of us are called to be what Alice  Miller the late great child psychologist  calls enlightened witnesses people who  through your kindness and tenderness and  focused attentive love returned people  to themselves you don't hold the bar up  and ask anybody to measure up you just  show up and you hold the mirror up and  you tell people the truth you say you  are exactly what God had in mind when  God made you and then you watch people  become that truth  you watch them inhabit that truth and no  bullet can pierce it  no for prison wall can't keep it out and  death can't touch it because it's huge  but sometimes you have to reach in and  dismantle messages of shame and disgrace  that get in the way so that the soul can  feel it's worth know homie I resisted my  offers have helped more than a kid named  bandit a gang member lived in Aliso  village housing projects I would ride my  bike in the middle of the night and I'd  see him run up to cars and sell crack  cocaine and walk away counting his money  I'd say how about a real job and he was  very polite you know that's okay gee  thanks though until one day 15 years ago  he shows up in my office I couldn't  believe he was there and he says what  gang members often say I'm tired of  being tired so I walked him to one of  our job developers and as luck would  have it they locate an entry-level  unskilled low-paying job first kind of  job in a warehouse now cut to today  bandit runs the whole thing he's the  supervisor of the supervisors owns his  own home he's married has three kids I  hadn't heard from him in in like two  years and he calls me one Friday  afternoon a little bit breathless and  panicky he says gee you got to bless my  daughter I said get by so me cuz she's  sick is she in the hospital oh no no on  Sunday she's going to Humboldt College  he imagined my oldest she's going to  college but she's a little chap I'd eat  then we're afraid for you you think  there's you any way you could give her a  blessing before she goes like oh are you  kidding I'd be honored  look tomorrow's Saturday I have baptisms  at 1:00 why don't you come at 12:30  we'll do a little send-off and sure  enough bandit and his wife and the three  kids show up at 12:30 and we situate  everybody in front of the alter and I  said well let's put Jessica in the  middle let's surround her with our  bodies and with our love everybody touch  your connect to her put your hands on  her shoulder on on her arms go ahead put  trance on your head and I say you know  bow your heads close your eyes and as  the homies say I do a long-ass prayer  you know I go on and  yeah and somewhere in the middle of this  prayer I noticed we've all become  chiana's you know we're all crying we're  all sniffling I don't know why we're  crying except for the fact that bandit  and his wife don't know anybody who's  ever gone to college except me certainly  nobody in their families so you know we  kind of wipe our eyes and we laugh about  how mushy we got and and so to change  the subject I look at Jessica eh what  are you gonna study at Humboldt College  she was very quick forensic psychology I  go damn forensic psychology and bandit  chimes in yes she wants to study the  criminal mind and Jessica very deadpan  looks at her father and she does one of  the internet and he sees her and  says yeah I'm going to be her first  subject so we walk up to the car and big  IVA rustles and they pile in the car but  bandit hangs back I'm glad he has and I  say hey can I tell you something I give  you credit for the man you've chosen to  become for choosing to walk in your own  footsteps  I'm proud of you and as eyes well up  with tears and he says I was gay I'm  proud of myself all my life people  called me a low-life a bundle but  another good-for-nothing I guess I  showed them I said yeah I guess you did  and the soul feels it's worth people  always ask me got enemies who work  together it's kind of tense at first a  homie will come in and say I'm ready I'm  ready  and I'll say okay I have an opening in  the bakery but you have to work with X Y  & Z and I rattle off the names of rivals  and they always say the same thing they  always say I'll work with them but I'm  not going to talk to them but you know  that used to bother me in the early days  but you know the truth is human beings  can't demonize people they know it's  hard to sustain that really so I had a  homie named youngster little tiny guy  every  he called him youngster and I thought he  was ready so I bring him into the  homeboy silkscreen Factory and I  introduce him to all his thirty  co-workers it's our biggest business  huge factory and I watch him as he  shakes hands with everybody looking them  in the eyes even enemies until he gets  to the last guy a guy everybody called  puppet and puppet seems to be avoiding  this encounter all together and when  puppet and youngster are in each other's  vicinity they kind of mumble something  they start their shoes they don't shake  hands well I know they're enemies but he  just finished shaking hands with other  enemies I discover later that this is a  hatred that's quite personal and deep  beyond which neither of them think they  can get past so I sense that at the  moment and I say eh if you guys can't  hang working together let me know I got  a bunch of people want this job and they  say nothing six months later puppet is  walking to a corner store not far from  his home and buy something and but on  the way home he kind of takes a detour a  shortcut cuts into an alley suddenly  he's surrounded by ten members of a  rival gang ten against one they beat him  badly he falls to the ground while he's  lying on the ground they will not stop  kicking his head until he's lying there  lifeless somebody finds his body takes  him to White Memorial Hospital where  he's declared effectively brain-dead  though it's the policy there to keep you  connected to machines for 48 hours so  the doctors can get two days of a flat  read then they sign the death  certificate  this allowed family and friends to  gather I was in st. Louis University  giving a talk I flew home I've seen a  lot of horrible things in my life but  nothing to compare to the sight of this  young man with his head swollen many  many times its size it was horrifying  you could barely train your eyes on him  so at the end of the 48 hour period I  gave him a blessing i anointed his  forehead with oil we disconnected and a  week later I buried him  but in the first 24 hours I'm alone in  my office it's 8:30 at night and the  phone rings and it's youngster from the  silkscreen Factory puppets coworker hey  he says that's the best stuff about what  happened to puppet I said yeah it is and  then with a certain kind of eagerness  even he says is there anything I can do  can I give him my blood and we both fall  silent under the weight of it until  finally he breaks the silence choking  back his tears and he says with great  deliberation he was not my enemy he was  my friend we work together now can I say  that always happens at homeboy  industries yeah any exceptions no and it  shouldn't surprise us that God's own  dream come true  for us that we be one just happens to be  our own deepest longing for ourselves it  turns out it's Mutual for the vision  still has its time presses on to  fulfillment and it will not disappoint  and if it delays we can wait for it  thank you very much"
"Two words that can change the world, YES AND",Karen Tilstra,Two words can change your life I do you're fired it's malignant or for us Central Florida people for rivers yeah there's two other words simple rather mundane and very common that when us together can also change your life and change the world these two words yes and yes and yes for I'm listening I'm suspending judgment and for I will add to it and help move forward for example when Rosa got on the bus she said I can buy this bus and sit in the front when the computer whiz that his friend said let's build an open-source encyclopedia and make it free for the whole world and JFK said let's take a man to the moon and bring him back now not all ideas should or could be as big as the ones I just mentioned but I would like to propose that every idea deserves at least one minute of life that's kind of radical I know there's a lot of bad ideas in fact I even googled bad ideas and there were 716 million entries that came up so I took a moment and peruse through a few of them and I just randomly picked three a cement parachute a glass hammer and an invisible TV so yes sounds like pretty bad ideas well I said all right I'm going to apply the yes--and theory I'm going to study these out a little so it turns out that yes of a cement parachute is a bad idea if you're jumping from a plane and want to live but if you're a band in Scotland looking for a name the cement parachutes might be a pretty good or if a contractor's I doubt would use glass hammers but if you're a woman working in technology and you just broke through the glass ceiling and you were nominated to win the glass hammer award that'd be pretty good and invisible TVs have you seen them well maybe not there are 72 inches long and 1/4 inch wide so from the side you can't see them yes and changes our Yes No Ratio perspectives psychologists tell us that we have we have all been conditioned to say no in fact the older we get the more we say no and there is a theory that we have a yes/no ratio in our life some more than others I guess because you everybody would say yes once to maybe for nose or yes 219 nose it just sort of depends on your situation but the key is to be mindful of what your ratio is because we all have a yes/no ratio because it turns out that it doesn't really matter if an idea is good or bad if it's new and different we will say no to it and because new and different ideas scare us take us off kilter and confuse us and I off-kilter confused scared mind says no so I would like to add something to the great statement that Victor Hugo said that an army of men cannot stop an idea whose time has come I would like to add but we certainly try and because we're so used to saying no we don't even realize for saying no sometimes for example when my boys want to go to a movie I might say don't waste your money that's not a very good movie or maybe they're dating somebody don't go out with her she's a loser I think I'm only out of love I'm saying it of love or if they're looking at a certain major in university I might say don't take this major you'll never get a job I say that out of worry but we just are blind sometimes to our nose but when we do know we're saying no we actually like to blame it on someone else or do other things like for example the devil may let me be the devil's advocate and who wants to argue with the devil I don't or we become historians didn't we try that five years ago and it was a bad idea then or we just simply trifle with people's emotions and we say hey that's a great idea but it'll never work and we oftentimes role are propensity to say no intern environments and we become confounded by the environment that we feel like we have to say no I've had people say to me I can't serve with sabe peas in my house my kids don't like him or we can't be creative here we're too busy making money or our boss doesn't want any new ideas we already have our five year strategic plan or on a personal note I'm too old no one Innovation Lab listens to me I'm too young no one listens to me I'm too fat no one takes me seriously or this hasn't been my particular problem I'm too thin no one takes me seriously well I work in an environment that's very restrictive one mistake could result in lawsuit firing or death I work in a hospital and about a year ago we decided to open up a Innovation Lab the Florida Hospital Innovation Lab and the CEO David banks invited everybody all the employees to come and participate ideas from everywhere voices from everyone and we built the lab on the idea of everybody has creative capacity and leadership potential we had three goals to create better solutions for healthcare to develop innovative and design thinkers and to help build a culture of innovation so when word got out people started coming and we noticed three categories of people who thought they had no ideas people who thought they had all the ideas and people who would shoot down the ideas and so we realized that even though we had a really powerful innovation process we would get nowhere without a yes and mentality so we had to build a bridge of yes and start teaching basic simple improv games to people that were based in yes and they really it that gave them the exact the example of what yes and really means and we found that it worked we have over 50 projects in the lab now and we've taught more than 800 people the concept of yes and we did a survey last month and we found that 93% of the people that had been the lab said they would come back and they would recommend people to come and bring their challenges there we were pretty excited about that now I'm curious how many improv artists do we have here today a few well how many of us today are interested in being innovative creative or help create solutions for a better future how many okay good all of us well so but there's a discrepancy did you notice a few improv artists but all the rest of us are interested in being innovative we found the same thing in Improv and Innovation the lab people were interested but they didn't think they could well it turns out that improv and innovation are the same you might say wait a minute improv is about comedy and jazz and innovation is about creating cell phones and bladeless fans but in in reality in reality improv is not about comedy is core and improv is not about or Yes and innovation is not about inventions at its core both of them are about two words yes and the open space for us to move past our habitual ways of thinking and acting and it gives you a tool that you can actually let your own true creativity be seen by the world you can give you a gift to the world and if you don't give your gift to the world nobody will and the world will be lost forever to your gift and yes an is the way for you to Creativity Innovation roll it out and the economists told us about six years ago that creativity and innovation we're our best resources for this century the Harvard Business Review has had an article on innovation and creativity and almost area every issue for the last ten years and Google if you google innovation you'll get four hundred and fifteen million hits not as much as bad ideas but it's sort of interesting but if there's a lot and the really cool thing is yes and is easy to do believe it or not all you have to do there's no new words you have to learn yes and we all know that in any language it's free and it just takes two seconds of courage and when you say yes and to something you immediately unite a community you build bonds you suspend judgment you were in the now you ignite the strengths of the group are the strengths within the group and you also are able to embrace failure and learn from what the failure or see it as an opportunity now I first encountered ESA and in a very real way when I was in the fourth grade and I was a really bad student and when I first second third I looked to the fourth grade teacher mrs. asked you and I could not wait to me in the fourth grade because I thought she was so cool even though she was about 120 years old I reckoned and when she would take her students out for recess she would sit on the bench and fall asleep and they would hurricanes had recess like three times longer and when they went back in when they went back in to class she would let one of the better readers in the class read and she said your front her desk and fall asleep and they could read the whole afternoon so I could not wait to be in the fourth grade so imagine my dismay when I walked in the first day of fourth grade and mrs. st was not there but a lady with very skinny legs red hair and a wrinkly neck I was staring at her neck when she said class hello my name is mrs. roster and she turned and wrote it on the board well it might have The Chicken Dance been my fourth-grade wisdom or my frustration that mrs. esky wasn't there but I said to her I was sitting around the front room you really ought to go by mrs. rooster since you looked like one say I was a bad student well so she turned around just like that and she said yes and they have a dance the chicken dance and she taught it she said stand up we're gonna learn it and she taught it to us I remember it still beaks wings tail feathers and keep for pups maybe you know the chicken dance well a little later a few weeks later Ronny Antone one of the boys in our class had to go to the bathroom and you know the little bathrooms in the back he Paper Towels went back somebody was in there and so he went up to the front the room to ask mrs. roster if he could use the girls bathroom but it was too late he peed his pants right there on the floor and so oh we thought that was hilarious and so um mrs. roster jumps up and she dropped some paper towel grabs paper towels drops it in the puddle of pee and begins wiping her feet and she says come on class everybody get some paper towels we're going to learn how to paper towel ski up and down the classroom so we did she did up and down the whole aisles and then she even thanked Ronnie Antone and we were done she thanked him for the experience well a little later in the year she said we're going to be doing oral reports and she assigned topics and she signed me Eagles so time went on and one morning she said today's the day we're giving her all reports after lunch and so I listened to her say Panic Lunch that I thought okay I have not done one thing to prepare and I've started to be filled with dread because I thought my life is going to end after lunch and I just sat and watched the clock ticked by and I became more and more filled with dread panic lunch came I asked mrs. su if I could come in a little early and I got out my little handwriting paper on that brown paper with the blue lines and I wrote three sentences and then I waited the class came in this is a roster stood up and she said okay well start the reports she seemed pretty excited I was just paralyzed with fear and people start giving they're so fine she called me Karen will now hear about Eagles so I stood up and I knew she could not see my pounding heart or the tears of the edge of my eyes that I was about to shed and I went to the front of class and I just stood there and said okay Karen you can give the report so I said Eagles are birds Eagles build nests Eagles can fly and I knew my classmates were just going to break into gales of laughter but she stood up and she said class Karen has just given us three characteristics of Eagles I'm going to write them on the board let's fill it in and she's come up and he knows something let's fill it in if you want to draw something you can draw I went back to my chair and the love I felt for mrs. roster could have spread around the world and the data gratitude I owed her I knew could only be repaid by becoming a better student mrs. roster embodied vs aunt and she inspired the creativity and the potential of my whole class we're all mrs. rosters every one of us in here is a mrs. roster and if you don't believe me if you did one of three things today it's proof if you walk in here on your own accord if you carried on a conversation with somebody or you drove today yesterday I'm you drove safely that is we can't always assume and because there was a day when you couldn't even say yes and you learned not only yes then you're speaking fluently there was a day you laid in your crib with your feet flying over your head but you're walking and you're running skipping and there was a day you didn't know how to drive and your parent a neighbor a teacher yes and you to competency on the road every stop we hope so that is yes and that's the power of your send I just finished a five-year study in creativity innovation which included a 250 page dissertation okay I survived through and with as I got done with it I look back and all of that can be boiled down to two words you probably don't I'm going to say yes and so I could have written a shorter dissertation but I don't think like I don't I don't think my advisor but have liked it so we're all improv artists we are all creative for all innovative so I'd like to encourage and invite every one of you before you leave tonight to say yes and is something that you might not have otherwise start a yes and revolution in your life because your ideas deserve one minute of life ignite the inspiration the creativity and the potential in your life and the life of others by two small birds yes and you
A healthy lifestyle you can stomach,Nadya Andreeva,My name is Nadia and I'm a little bit nervous because I'm gonna have to get undressed in front of you but before I start I wanted to ask a question how many of you had a status Factory poop this morning by show of hands not that many those of you who didn't raise a hand I'm on a hundred million Americans who don't have regular bowel movements and it is actually turning into a big problem slowly but surely we're turning into a constipated nation anywhere between thirty to seventy percent of the Americans don't go to the bathroom on a daily basis if you were to ask a Western doctor they would probably tell you that going to the bathroom twice a week is quite normal but if you go to holistic doctor they'll tell you that digestion is a cornerstone of health and you have to empty out your pipes every single day to maintain good health if you look around to animals or even your pets or your dog you'll know that not one healthy dog goes to the bathroom only twice a week they go three times a day so if you don't clean out your digestion what you get is a whole bag of toxins from anything in your body and absorbing into the bloodstream and slowly but surely it will lead to disease it can start with bloating and just feeling heavy but over time it leads to bad breath bad body order allergies poor sleep fatigue you name it according to Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine almost every single disease can be traced back to the digestion the good thing is that we have all the tools to fix our digestion with a few small dietary changes and if you tools and practices that physically help to move things along and I'm going to show you one of those amazing practices today this practice is thousands of years old it was first mentioned in Vedic texts including hatha yoga pradipika and it was one of the six cleansing rituals for Yogi's so to show that to you I'm gonna have to get undressed it helps to improve circulation in your stomach and to physically move things along by creating almost a vacuum like suction so I'm going to walk you through the whole thing step by step it is best if you do it on an empty stomach and if you want to improve the effects it's good to drink a cup of water with lemon water with lemon to just stimulate peristalsis but you start with your palms and your thighs and this move everyone can do you don't need any practice so the first thing you wake up in the morning tomorrow do it you take an inhale exhale oh they're out hold the breath and you start pumping the stomach like this so even this simple move will already create heat and stimulate circulation the second move is a little bit tricky because you have to kind of shift your weight from side to side and that's the way it looks so you actually get moving things along quite well it's very very effective and everyone that I've taught it to gets it within the first couple of weeks so it's not that difficult and besides being an amazing party trick you'll be the center of attention anywhere you go promise you that it got me here but it also is an instrument that allows you to keep your body in a healthy state and since the digestion is a cornerstone of health it is super important to learn techniques not to rely on pills but to let your body heal and balance itself by using something like nollie thank you 
Is your phone part of your mind?,David Chalmers,"Hi, everyone! I want to talk to you about a new way of looking at the mind. What I call the extended mind is the idea that the technology we use becomes part of our minds, extending our minds and indeed ourselves into the world. The extended body We'll start with something that might be a little bit more familiar: the extended body. We are used to the idea that we can extend our bodies with technology. We know about prosthetic limbs. Here is the athlete Oscar Pistorius running on his prosthetic legs. You don't need prosthetic limbs to extend your body. Blind people say that their canes serve as an extension of their body. You know, it feels exactly like a body from the inside, or in more mundane everyday experience, a car can feel like an extension of your body, a bike, or indeed, a musical instrument. You saw a great illustration of that a few minutes ago with Tjupurru with his didjeribone, a real extension of his body. Well, so it is with the body, so it is for the extended mind, where technology gets incorporated into our human minds. You might think that to incorporate technology into your mind you'd have to turn yourself into a cyborg. Something like that! A whole bunch of, you know, of pipes and tubes inside your head, or at least you need a whole bunch of fancy technology like this on your head, but I actually think there's a more ordinary kind of mind extension, which is happening to us right now, all the time, as we move into the technological future. So take our friend the iPhone. The extended mind I've had one of these now for maybe three or four years, and it's basically started taking over a whole bunch of the functions of my brain. (Laughter) Things my brain used to do are now done by my iPhone. I mean, there's a million examples, take memory: How many people use their brains to remember phone numbers anymore? Not me! You know, my iPhone does all the work. It used to be, the biological memory used to carry the load, now the iPhone is carrying the load for me, acting as my memory. The iPhone serves to control planning functions that my brain used to do. Spatial navigation, offloaded from my brain into Google Maps. The iPhone even stores as the repository of my desires. I've got a program on the iPhone that tells me my favorite dishes at the local restaurant. I go there and just look it up and say this, this, this. The iPhone is controlling my desires for me. It even makes decisions for me. Here's the executive decision maker. Am I going to go speak at that TED conference? Oh, definitely! You might say, ""Okay, well, this is all a big metaphor, and it's a little bit like a mind in someways."" But I think there's actually an interesting philosophical thesis here that I want to defend, that in some sense the iPhone is literally becoming part of your mind. Your mind is extending from your brain into the world, so the iPhone is actually part of it. The iPhone hasn't been implanted into your mind, but you might think it's as if it were in. Here's an iPhone implanted into your mind, it's as if it was implanted into your mind, although it's actually out there in the world. That's the extended mind thesis. So the iPhone's memory is basically my memory. The iPhones planning or navigation is basically my planning and navigation as if it had happened inside the brain. Now for me as a philosopher, this is really interesting because one of the central philosophical problems about the mind, maybe the central philosophical problem about the mind, is what we call the mind-brain problem. How does the mind - your thinking and your feeling - relate to your brain, this bunch of mushy neurons you have inside your head? Is it something more or is it something less? If you ask most people, ""Where is your mind?"" they'd point and say, ""Well, it's somewhere in there."" This extended mind thesis, I think it's some transformed vision of the mind, but the mind is not just in the brain, it's partly in the world around us, in the environment that we interact with. Now, I don't know. Objections You might think this is kind of crazy or even totally mad. When my collaborator, Andy Clark, and I first put this thesis forward back in the mid 1990s, we came across a bit of resistance then; a lot of people made objections. Back then, we didn't have iPhones. Our central example was a notebook. People writing stuff down in the notebook and using that as a memory. And indeed, you don't need high-tech to get the idea of the extended mind going. The very first time somebody counted on their fingers, that was a kind of mind extension. A kind of addition that could have been taking place in your head is happening on your fingers, but technology really amplifies this extension of our mind. And I think it's made the thesis ring true for more people as well, because we experience this actually happening to us. But still you might object in various ways. This iPhone is just a tool, it's not really part your mind. For it really to become part of your mind, you'd have to implant it like this. To be in your mind it's got to be on the inside of your skull. Or maybe, it can't be part of your mind: it's metal. Minds are biological. They involve a soul or something. Now, I think it's a tricky issue, but I think this kind of reaction which you get involves a kind of a brain chauvinism. It's like a gender chauvinism, or race chauvinism, or species chauvinism. What's so special about the brain? What's so special about the inside of the brain, compared to the outside? For a start, it's like, if you've got stuff that's going on on the inside of the brain, the same stuff could in principle go on on the outside of the brain. We want to say [there's] no difference in principle as long as it's driving the processes inside the brain, the action, the consciousness, in the same way that would happen otherwise. There's no principle barrier about the skull; that would be skull chauvinism. Likewise, metal versus biology. If the metal does the same job the biology is doing, that would also count as part of the mind. Otherwise it would be biology, DNA chauvinism. So I think that objection can be rejected. Consciousness You might think that - Somehow consciousness is at the very center of the mind, and I've got some sympathy with this. Consciousness is this deeply internal state. But I think what we're thinking, what we're feeling right in the present moment is at the core of the mind, but there's always a whole lot to our minds which is outside our consciousness. What we think, our innermost desires, our hopes, our fears, our personality traits, most of this is not passing through your mind at any given moment. Any given moment is just a tiny little snapshot. What makes you you is a whole bunch of stuff which is outside your consciousness available to affect us. So your memories are mostly outside your consciousness. The view here is it doesn't matter whether it's stored somewhere deep in your brain or out there in the world. If it's out there, accessible to you, driving your state, then it counts as part of your mind. There is still a brain at the core of all this. I'm not saying the iPhone is itself a mind. You are still the mind with your brain and your consciousness at the core. But the iPhone is part of it. It's kind of an extension, if you like. What was that? That's right, my iPhone begs to differ. It thinks it's the mind and I'm the extension. (Laughter) Extended Mind So this thesis I think is not just - it's a new way of looking at the world, a new way of looking at the mind. But I think it actually makes a difference to some of our practices. In Alzheimer's disease, when people describe themselves as losing their minds. And one thing we found works really well in handling people with Alzheimer and slowing the decline is the use of mind extension technology. People use notes in the environment, for example, to act as a kind of memory, external memory, with labels everywhere. This really serves to slow down the loss of mental function, keeping some aspect of their minds out there in the world. There are issues about - It makes a difference to education. There are debates about open book examinations and the use of calculators in exams. Well, if you take the extended mind thesis, you ought to be testing the whole extended self. If a calculator or a computer is going to be with you, coupled with you, reliably available in the future, it is part of your extended self, and you ought to be testing the whole extended self. Here's a case of extended perception. A blind person who starts using his iPhone as a vision tool. This is the color identification program, Color ID. You can download it. It basically reads out colors. You point it at something and it reads it out. He said he used this to see a sunset for the first time. He held it up and it said, ""Red, orange, yellow, azure, crimson."" He was moved to tears. It felt like he was seeing the sunset for the first time using this as an extended vision mechanism, extended perception mechanism. And as wearable computing becomes more and more ubiquitous in our lives, this is just going, I think, to become more and more common. Here we've got glasses that compute stuff for us through extended perception. There's also the socially extended mind. We all know when other people become extensions of your mind. We all know long-term couples where one person acts as another person's memory. You know, reminding them things at the right time, or when they finish each other's sentences or speak as a single individual in a conversation. In effect, what's happening now is one person is becoming part of, an extension of another person's mind or vice versa. I'll be in my mind if - I'll be in your mind if you'll be in mine. I think Bob Dylan said that. Social Networking Also, social networking is really amplifying this. So, when I was preparing this talk about a month ago, I sent a note out to Facebook. ""I've got to give a 15 minute TED Talk in Sydney next month, on the extended mind. Any ideas on how to approach it?"" And I got a whole lot of responses, some pretty useful responses from this social network, which is kind of surrounding us, becoming part of our extended mind. There were more, and there were more, and there were more, (Laughter) including of a whole bunch of useful suggestions, I stole a bunch of them. Not least of them, this one, ""Exciting, maybe you could work Facebook in?"" (Laughter) Or, ""Well you could start by mentioning you crowdsourced the whole talk ..."" Thanks guys, that was handy. Now there are some downsides and dangers to this whole extended mind thesis. And one is that as our minds move into the world, we become more vulnerable to their loss than when they are protected on the inside of the skull. This is already something familiar from things like the floods in Queensland or there are bushfires in Victoria. We often talk about the greatest tragedy being that people lose their memories. Their houses and their possessions and so on have basically become part of them. The loss of them really feels like the loss of one's self. And as more of one's mind gets extended, the more there is vulnerability. Just say somebody steals my iPhone. [IF YOU CAN READ THIS, SOMEBODY STOLE MY iPHONE] (Laughter) You might think that's a form of theft and they should be punished for this. But if I'm right, that should actually be reconceived as a really vicious form of assault. Like getting into my brain and messing with my neurons. And that really does kind of capture the attitude I have to my iPhone. Conclusion You might worry this is going to turn us into robots. Remember the guy from Lost in Space? ""Danger,"" Will Robinson! But I think we have to remember we still always have consciousness at the middle of this, and judgement, and the extension of our minds doesn't abrogate us from using our judgement. With better and better technology, which becomes more and more flexible, there's the hope that the interplay of judgement and technology might move us forward in interesting ways. So, I actually think then, to conclude, this extended mind thesis offers us some hope of an optimistic worldview. People say, ""Is Google making us stupid?"" This is a debate which has been out there in the media. Well, if I'm right about the extended mind thesis, there's a sense in which Google is actually making us smarter. Google is getting inside our minds. And I don't know about you, but I heard someone saying, ""When I sit down and Google, I feel like my IQ goes up 30 points."" (Laughter) It's like all that knowledge - and they say knowledge is power of a kind, so it leads to a kind of potential democratization, too, of the powers of the mind. As technology becomes cheaper and available to more, and more advanced, it's going to spread. Phones are already spreading. Google is spreading. With time, this becomes available to everyone. In a way I think what's going on here is a trend which is in the very early stages of turning us into superheroes of the mind. Technology is gradually giving us these superpowers, turning us into cognitive super geniuses, if you like, and it is going to go more and more this way in the future. The question is, will we use these powers for good or for evil? That's the gift of the extended mind and the challenge it presents as we move into our extended future. Thank you very much."
How to relieve the stress of caring for an aging parent,Amy O'Rourke,How many of you in here raise your hand can easily recognize a 2-year-old raise your hand all right now how many of you in here could easily recognize an 85-year-old raise your hand this is the topic of my talk today I'm going to talk about caring for the late life Elder and taking the stress out of it and I appreciate your time and attention all of us do here today thank you it means a lot I have a master's degree in public health administration and I have a master's degree in gerontology and I've worked with older adults for 30 years but most importantly I love working with older people I love it the first job I had out of college I was 21 years old I was the assistant activity director in a 21-bed nursing home and every day I'd walk down the hall and I'd go into Amelia's room that's Amelia with an E she would say that every day I'd walk in the room and I would say Amelia it's time to go to bingo More arts and crafts and she would say honey I want to die and I would say if that's not going to happen in the next few minutes would you consider going to Bingo and she would laugh and she hit me on the arm and off we'd go I was hooked so in thinking about this topic lowering stress caring for old adults I've come up with three areas that I think deserve attention one is the denial of reality the second is knowing some Basic Ground rules and the third is accepting it as a lifestyle change now I have children that say to me you know I didn't expect this this has been a rude awakening I just didn't expect this this is a lot of stress their parents are 85 and I I think with my 30 years why are you surprised why how is that surprising but when I stopped and thought about it we live in a youth obsessed culture we're youth obsessed we've got anti-aging creams we've got surgeries you know what I'm talking about we love to read stories in the paper about 85 year old that graduate from college and 100-year-old that climbs Mount Everest well you know condalisa rice was offered the position of Secretary of State and she almost turned that job down you know why cuz her father had had a stroke and she didn't know if she could do that job and take care of her father and I do believe that's not widely known Hillary and Bill Clinton we all know Chelsea we watched Chelsea grow up we watched her go to college we certainly watched her get married Hillary lost her mother when her mother was 92 years old and when I read that in the paper I ate for Hillary has said publicly that her mother was the most influential person in her life and here Hillary was in the public eye caring for her mother and we didn't know it wasn't written about why is that we're scared we're afraid we're afraid of death you know what the number one fear in this country is it's public speaking true statement that's a true statement second is fear of death we're afraid of endings we're afraid of seeing our parents grow smaller do you know you lose 5 Ines yes you do the little old lady that's a real thing we're afraid of seeing our parents get smaller more diminished shaky judgment walking slower we're scared so we deny it we pretend it's not there we don't want to face it second is knowing some ground rules now this picture is lousy it's very grainy very grainy but I kept it up here because the woman Doris used to work for me and Richard Works in our office and we had them stage the picture as roll reversal ground rule number one roll reversal get this in your mind three words you ready big fat lie roll reversal never should happen we never become our parents and if you try you won't do so well try it go ahead so Doris is sitting here and we're doing this shot in my office and Doris is squirming and she's mad and I think she's really getting into this like it's a role play or something she's into it we get halfway through the shot and she's really mad and she says my daughter Connie talks to me that way and I can't stand it wow I wouldn't want to be Connie so a few weeks later I get a call from Connie Connie says thank you for the experience you gave my mother at your office she called me up and she said Connie you give me so much you help me so much but I don't like how you talk to me I don't like it you boss me around and Connie heard her she said thank you I know I do it and I'm going to work on it and the two of them are forging a new way of relating at this time of life and I felt so happy for them my friend Carol who has an 8-year-old and a six-year-old and parents father with Alzheimer's and a mother with mental illness says Amy you're that's not right I do tell my parents what to do I said no Carol you don't you don't you are responsible for them but you have worked on a way of communicating to help them manage this time of life without insulting them by telling them what to do and it takes some work ground rule number two I know there's people from the hospital in this audience today and I know that you will agree with me older people in hospitals don't always get along when you're a far older person you're you it's like an ecosystem one thing goes wrong it can be calamitous so going into the hospital for an older adult is a major decision don't minimize it they go into the hospital hospitals are fast they're bright staff running in and out and an older person moves slowly thinks slowly and they can Collide so your the question you should ask yourself is number one if they're going to have all these tests and not do the surgery as a result of all these tests get them out I just love the slide that's why it's up there it's called innocence in experience the last ground rule is that aging is a one-way transition it's one way I met with a daughter and her mother in my office my office is at the far end of the hall and the mother is spinal stenosis on a walker she took a long time to get to my office we got down there and sat down I let the daughter go first and the daughter starts talking about what she would want and in some of the things she was saying she said I want my mother to go to the gym 5 days a week and I feel like going like this cuz I can tell the mother's like rage you know the gym so I'm looking at the daughter and I look over at the mother and I know that this daughter cannot face the fact that her mother is where her mother is she's not going backwards kids want the parents to go backwards they want them to get to where they were and they miss where they are so I look over at the mother and I said well I can tell you kind of got you mad what is it that you want she says I'd like to go to the movies so I think we can arrange that so there's a famous author that wrote when her mother was sick she says I wish someone had told me that I would have all these decisions to make and none of those decisions would affect the outcome none of them and that the most important thing for me is to be there is to be there so the ground rule is aging is a one-way transition and lastly the last thought I will leave you with is this is a lifestyle change having Elder parents is a lifestyle change you have a child and you hopefully in 18 to 22 years you raise them and they go out the door hopefully I won't go in that direction I'll stay with what I'm talking about so then you got about 10 years off 10 years of Freedom if you will then becomes the responsibility for your parents whether they live in the same town as you the responsibility begins and the kids that have actually less stress are the ones that have accepted it you know we live in such a fast paced society now don't we I mean we just go go being with an older person is really an opportunity to slow down try to try to rush an older person try it you can't do it so you have to be there you have to slow down I kind of think about it like a form of meditation so I was walking up to Helen's house Helen's 100 I walk up the steps I walk into the kitchen she's in a kitchen she's seated and I walk in and I sit down and I said hi nice to meet you and she leans forward and she's got this big beautiful face but it's big and she's got white swept up hair kind of like a Q-tip let's stop she says to me what is it you think you can do for me said I just got here I I don't know she leans back in her chair and she says I don't know why I'm still here and I my heart just and I said maybe you're here because I needed to meet you maybe you're here because I needed to see and experience you and she leaned forward and she took her hand and that moment is still with me so I would say to you this is a rare opportunity a very rare opportunity don't miss it thank you
"Life is short, family is forever",Jane Carlson,"So cool so it all started on a road trip when I was a teenager my dad rigged a bike rack to the back of a trailer we pulled with our station wagon Somewhere in Arizona on a highway we had a car come alongside us honking madly and motioning for us to pull over we learned that our bikes had fallen off and they'd been run over by a Greyhound bus so one of the bikes was repairable so when we got to Santa Fe New Mexico we went to a repair shop my dad wrote his name on the repair ticket and the man behind the counter looked at that and said Don Don oide you and I are cousins this surprised me so much and it got me thinking if I'm related to this random guy who else am I related to look around you how closely might you be related to the other people in this room stay do you know your great-grandparents names you have eight of them I bet you don't know their names you can see that it doesn't take many generations for us to lose all connection to our past and what we share imagine in a few Generations that you too may be forgotten my grandmother gave me this photograph of a painting of her grandmother and she only knew the name of the one grandmother Mary mchan that was it the photo intrigued me enough that I've been on a quest all these years to find out who these people were why did they move from Scotland to Chicago what were their hopes and their dreams 20 years ago I had to travel to C our houses and libraries to research and today I can be at home in my Snuggie and my slippers and I can view oh bit U Aries birth marriage death certificates I can even look at find a grave and what might you learn from an old census record I learned that this young girl's grandson became an actor he starred in Motion Pictures as well as the television shows Father Knows Best and Marcus well MD well in my research I discovered that my grandmother would watch him on television but she had no idea that she was watching her second cousin our connections can be even um closer than that Steve Jobs later learned that the owner of a restaurant where he'd eaten several times a man with whom he had shaken hands was his birth and our connections can be even closer than that but the most exciting thing is our DNA and it's opening up a whole new world for us of finding our lost connections I took a DNA test myself and I found that of the 125,000 or so other people who tested with the company 23 and me that there was a my nearest relative was a man Phil other than my brother it said we're possible third cousins and I know that might be a tenuous connection and I don't normally go flying across the country to meet strangers but I flew to Texas for a visit we flipped through his photograph collection he had a box of photos and we came to the back of one and I recognized some of the names on the back and imagine my surprise when we flipped over the photograph and I saw this and the names all match my research so I want to leave you with a thought today and that is to label your photographs ask the questions share your stories before they disappear and leave Clues so that you won't be forgotten and if Facebook were around in 1848 and remember life is short and family is forever thank you"
The erosion of empathy,Simon Baron Cohen,"These two Nazi scientists worked at the Dachau Concentration Camp during World War II. They were conducting an experiment to see how long a human being could survive in freezing water. Like good scientists, they took systematic measures including duration until death. Examples of human cruelty of this kind raise a big question. How is it possible to treat a person as a mere object? The traditional explanation for human cruelty is in terms of evil. I find the concept of evil unhelpful and unscientific. It implies that the person is possessed by some supernatural force. Even worse it's dangerously circular; if the definition of evil is the absence of good, then all we're really saying is he did something bad because he is not good. It hasn't really taken us any further forward. In contrast the concept of empathy, I'm going to argue is scientifically helpful; you can measure it, you can study it. Empathy has two distinct components -- cognitive and affective. Cognitive empathy is the ability to imagine someone else's thoughts and feelings; putting yourself into someone else's shoes. It's the recognition part. Affective empathy is the drive to respond with an appropriate emotion to what someone else is thinking or feeling. I'm going to argue that low affective empathy is a necessary factor to explain human cruelty. Empathy isn't all or none; it comes by degrees, and there a individual differences in it. So it gives rise to the empathy bell curve. Most of us are in the middle of this spectrum with average amounts of empathy. There are some people who have above average levels of empathy. But what are the factors that can lead an individual to have low empathy either temporarily or permanently? What are those social factors? What are those biological factors? Biological factors One social factor is obedience to authority. The experiment by Stanley Milgram at Yale University showed that people are willing to administer electric shocks to someone to help them learn, if they're instructed to do so by an authority figure. This suggests that simply, following orders may be one factor that can erode our empathy. A second social factor is ideology. When the terrorists flew the planes into the World Trade Center on 9/11, We have to assume that they were in the grip of a strongly-held belief that they were doing the right thing. Of course, we don't know whether the terrorists who signed up for that action had low empathy to begin with, but it's possible that their ideological beliefs were another factor that could erode their empathy for their victims. Ingroup relations A third social factor is in-group/out-group relations. In Rwanda, we saw one ethnic group used propaganda to stereotype the out-group; describing them as subhuman and as cockroaches. When we dehumanize a group as the enemy, we have the potential to lose our empathy; and we saw the catastrophic genocide that ensued. Ted Bundy But none of these social factors can explain individuals like Ted Bundy. He started his adult career as a psychology student of the University of Washington where he volunteered on a telephone helpline and persuaded women to meet him. And over the successive years, he committed rape and murder of at least 30 women. We can assume that he had good cognitive empathy because he was able to deceive his victims, but that he lacked affective empathy - he just didn't care - and he lacked it in enduring ways. James Blair The evidence that psychopaths like Ted Bundy lack affective empathy comes from an experiment by James Blair that was conducted in Broadmoor Hospital. He showed psychopaths and a control group three different types of images, threatening images, neutral images, and images of people in distress. What he found was that the psychopaths only showed reduced physiological response when they saw the images of people in distress. So this suggests that they lacked affective empathy. People with autism have difficulties with cognitive empathy. They struggle to imagine other people's thoughts, their motives, their intentions, and their feelings. But people with autism don't tend to hurt other people; instead, they are confused by other people and withdraw socially, preferring the more predictable world of objects. People with autism have intact affective empathy because when they hear that somebody is suffering it upsets them. This leads us to imagine that people with autism and psychopaths are mirror opposites. The psychopath has good cognitive empathy - that's how they can deceive - but they have reduced affective empathy. People with autism have intact affective empathy, but struggle with cognitive empathy for neurological reasons. Psychopath Psychopaths don't come out of nowhere. Many of them have shown antisocial behavior and delinquency in their teens. John Bowlby at the Tavistock Clinic in London studied delinquents and found that many of them had experienced emotional neglect in early childhood. He argued that the absence of parental love in early childhood is another factor that can erode your empathy. Maltreatment But we know that early experience can't be the whole story because not everyone who has a bad childhood loses their empathy. Avshalom Caspi at the Institute of Psychiatry in London showed that if you've experienced severe maltreatment in childhood that increases your risk of delinquency. But your risk of deliquency goes up even more if you also a carrier of one version of the MAO-A gene shown here in red; so genes and environment interact. Testosterone Another biological factor that is associated with empathy levels is the hormone testosterone. In the fetus, testosterone shapes brain development. We've measured testosterone in the amniotic fluid that surrounds the baby in women who are having amniocentesis during pregnancy. Cognitive empathy We then wait for the baby to be born, and we follow up the children. When the children were eight years old, we asked them which word best describes what the person in the photo is thinking or feeling. Here the correct answer is he is interested in something. What we found was that the higher the level of fetal testosterone, the more difficulties the child was having at this test of cognitive empathy. How much empathy we show is a function of the empathy circuit; a network of regions in the brain. Here we can look at just two of them: in red, for left ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and in blue, the amygdala. This is Phineas Gage who suffered damage to his left ventromedial prefrontal cortex after dynamite blasted a metal rod up behind his eye and through his brain. Before the accident, he was described as a polite, considerate individual. After the accident, he was described as rude and no longer able to judge what was socially appropriate for different situations. He'd lost his cognitive empathy. Positive side of empathy Jean Decety at the University of Chicago used brain scanning - functional magnetic resonance imaging - to look at the teenage delinquent brain whilst they were watching films where somebody experiences pain such as when this piano player's fingers got crushed by the lid of the piano falling down on his fingers. What he found was that teenagers with delinquency didn't show the typical levels of activity in the amygdala -- part of the empathy circuit in the brain. But let's not forget the positive side of empathy. Most of us have enough empathy, and some people have high levels of empathy. When these two men formed a relationship based on mutual respect and on empathy, it let to the end of apartheid in South Africa. Empathy is vital for a healthy democracy; it ensures that we listen to different perspectives, we hear other people's emotions, and we also feel them. Indeed without empathy, democracy would not be possible. Conclusion I met this two women in Cambridge this week when they came to visit. On the left is Siham, and she is a Palestinian woman; her brother was shot and killed by an Israeli bullet. On the right is Robi; she is an Israeli woman. Her son was killed by a Palestinian bullet. These two women have taken the courageous step of forming a relationship across the political divide. They haven't given in to the emotion of revenge which would simply perpetuate the cycle of violence. Instead, they've used their empathy to recognize that they both share the same sorrow, the same awful pain of having lost a loved one. Empathy is our most valuable natural resource for conflict resolution. We could wait for our political leaders to use empathy - and that would be refreshing - but actually, we could all use our empathy. As Siham and Robi told me, ""The conflict won't stop until we empathize."" Thank you."
The cape makes the superhero,Jorge Peña,Hi all right let's press play but there's a problem uh most people think that playing video games is a trivial waste of time even my parents who made a living out of selling video games back in the '90s well they also thought that playing video games was pretty much a waste of time though most people disregard the act of playing video games the fact is that virtual experiences feel real and they can stir profound emotions and behaviors think about it when we play video games you can live the life of a different character like becoming an Italian plumber called Mario okay or Luigi or you can visit worlds that defy our imagination like the dreamlands in Final Fantasy today I would like to talk about three ways in which video games can profoundly affect our emotions and behaviors first I would like to talk about how in video games and in Virtual environments the cape makes the superhero how playing video games can also lead to Virtual persuasion effects and finally I would like to talk about some concrete applications of this knowledge like for example can we get Gamers to exercise more after they play the video game tough [Laughter] call people change depending on their external appearance psychologists use the term enclothe cognition to refer to how we change based on the clothes that we're wearing some clothes make us feel cool or uncool or powerful and in control or even depending on what we're wearing powerless and even awkward kids seem to be very much aware of this effect this must not leave the room but I was that kid that kid that was always wearing costumes all day every day perhaps in an attempt to live my life as if I was a different character with superpowers no researcher has demonstrated this effect any better than Buck Bunny and Elmer fud uh anyone remember those characters all right um in one episode this truck full of theatrical props tilts over and all of these costumes come flying out in the air Elmer fod is chasing bugs bunny but the characters start to switch roles depending on what clothes they're wearing like a soldier's Helmet or a Pilgrim's hat or a gangster outfit and hilarity ensues from this constant roll reversal in which the hunted becomes the Hunter and vice versa something like this also happens in games and virtual environments for example we invited participants to have online discussions and all we did there is to have half of them to wear avatars or a virtual self dressed in black and the other half of the participants were just using avatars dressed in black in white I'm sorry uh interestingly enough the participants that were using Avatar's dress in Black became a little bit more assertive a little bit more aggressive in these online discussions but when you would ask the participants they didn't know that this was actually happening that they were becoming more assertive and a little bit more aggressive colleagues have also shown this effect by for example having people use avatars or a virtual Persona in a virtual environment that would be taller than what you really are as a way to boost confidence and researchers nowadays are also looking at how character choice in popular games like for example World of Warcraft and League of Legends is associated not only to specific in-game behaviors but how character choice is associated to the behaviors that people enact outside of the game researchers may not necessarily agree on what to call this effects but we all can agree that in Virtual environments the cape makes the superhero in what other ways do virtual experiences matter let me give you one example back in 2008 and also in 2012 President Obama bought ads put advertisements in popular car racing games but also in games like for example the very popular Madden NFL franchise that begs the question can dual experiences affect the way that people shop online or even vote for a political candidate design features in Virtual environments appear to have persuasive effects like for example seeing an avatar that looks like you in a virtual environment endorsing a product can also lead people to prefer that product also in real life seeing an avatar that looks like you in a virtual environment get older can get people to start saving more money as a way to prepare for the future what about my President Obama example well we also know that in Virtual context sometimes when the game is going too fast people may not have enough mental capacity to remember the ads so in regards to President Obama's ads if they were placed in a virtual environment that was too fast-paced then people might have not been persuaded let's go back to my previous example of people becoming older in a virtual environment uh in a recent study what we did is to have young people like many of you today in the audience use older avatars or young avatars interestingly enough participants that were using an older Avatar behaved like older people while they were shopping online there was a 3 second delay when people were using older avatars and were walking around this virtual store they just walk more slowly more interestingly young people using older avatars selected products that were marketed towards older people while younger people using young avatars pre prefer products as you might expect that were marketed towards younger people in addition to this what about persuasion in the context of violent video games well it turns out that violent video game context might not be the best return of investment it may just not work uh violence is not only distressful but it is also distracting for example we had our participants go through a virtual environment and see all of these Brands like Konami Nintendo EA Etc but in the violent context they remember fewer of these brands in comparison to people to that went through a similar virtual environment that did not feature this aggressive information it appears that violence depletes our cognitive resources to process some of these ads and overall it might be that advertising in violent games is perhaps not an advisable strategy not only from a moral standpoint but also from a return on off investment standpoint in what other ways can we use this knowledge in what other ways can we use this V virtual persuasive effects for example can we get Gamers to exercise more depending on their virtual experiences well recent Studies have shown something really interesting for example seeing yourself lose weight or gain weight in a virtual environment can get people to exercise more at least temporarily perhaps in an attempt to reach uh to reach that virtual weight loss ideal or perhaps to compensate for seeing yourself getting a little bit chunkier in a virtual environment most people assume that gamers are coup potatoes but that's not necessarily the case here's another example of this here at UC Davis we tried the following we invited our participants to play We tennis anybody here has ever played we tennis okay so you would know that you would use the motion controller as if it was a racket and you would play win tennis as more or less the same way as you play regular tennis we hooked our participants to motion trackers that would measure their behaviors as they were actually playing the game so we attach a motion tracker on the wrist and another motion tracker on participants waste and we gave our participants this type of avatars half of our participants use a thin Avatar and half of our participants used a more obese avatar for themselves and as when they were playing the game they played against the AI that would be represented with a theme or an obese Avatar the expectation here was that when seeing your avatar as a fit thin athlete that that would remind you of agility and that when seeing your own avatar as a more obese as a chunkier avatar that that may remind people of sluggishness interestingly enough people move more in real life when they were playing this game when having the thin Avatar as opposed to the obese Avatar we were able to replicate this effect in both a sample of males and female participants it worked the same way this virtual influence work on both males and females but what about one's real self well we were very surprised that people's own body mass index their BMI did not affect the results it might be that people get so immersed in the virtual environment that at least temporarily that virtual self becomes more important that one's real self when playing the game with a slim Avatar against a slim opponent people move the most this might be a social comparison effect when you see yourself in in a virtual environment as a fit Avatar and you see your opponent also as a fit Avatar it might be that people move more in real life to increase their odds of winning overall the design features of virtual environments are nothing but trivial virtual experiences not only feel real but they can temporarily affect the thoughts emotions and behaviors of people that play games we should harness this knowledge not only to make our lives a little bit more fun and entertaining but also to make all of those virtual moments count for something bigger I would like to give thanks tonight to some of the students working in my laboratory some of them might be here tonight Jan gnavi subuhi Cassie alexop poos M ye and Andrew cob thanks everyone have a great afternoon
Why not ditch bosses and distribute power,Brian Robertson,All right hello so I've had a lifelong fascination with how we organize how we humans work together to express some work or some purpose in the world and I'd like to start by sharing a story bit about my journey it's a story that's true and it's become a bit of a metaphor for my own my own path I have a private A harrowing experience pilot's license and when I was first learning to fly I had a rather harrowing experience I'm up in the plane I'm still a student pilot I have 20-some hours of flight time I yes they let you fly a plane alone with 20-some hours of practice so I'm up in this plane it's my first cross-country solo flight so the first time I'm flying hundreds of miles away from home with no instructor with me and I'm all ready for the journey I go up I start flying little nervous and the low voltage light comes on they don't teach you much about how the plane works right barely not apply the thing so you know what do I do well my first instinct is to you know tap the low voltage light but that doesn't change anything my next instinct is to check my other instruments to see if there's a big problem here right so one by one I check all of my other instruments the altimeter says you're not losing altitude there's nothing wrong all right the navigation aid says you're perfectly on course congratulations everything's fine the airspeed indicator says you're not losing speed you're flying fast everything's great so I let those other instruments outvote the low voltage light yeah I figured nothing else is reporting anything anomalous it must not be that big of a problem right that was a really bad idea turns out who would have thought that low voltage light is actually tuned in to different information than every other instrument on that control panel oops I nearly crashed the plane that day and fortunately I did make it down there were some steps in the middle there I'll skip for you but I made it down and after the adrenaline wears off it occurs to me we do this in our organizations all the time when we humans show up in organizations we become the sensors the instruments for that organizations flight towards its purpose we sense reality on its behalf it is through us that it becomes aware of whatever it needs to deal with or do in the world and we humans are different and we sense different things we have different talents backgrounds different types different talents we sense different things and it's sometimes something sensed by only one person or by the many minority that's critical to integrate into how we proceed and we often ignore them and this really echoed my experience back when I worked in more conventional organizations that was my experience I showed up in a company I wanted to be a sensor for this company I wanted to be an instrument I sensed reality and I wanted to do something with it and I'm sure all of you have had the experience of going into some organization somewhere and sensing something important maybe it's a hole in a process or a way to improve something that's not working as well as it could be something slipping through the cracks and I'd often have those experiences but have nothing I could do to act on them right there'd be no way to integrate that into the organization in fact I No way to integrate learned early on that if the boss didn't sense it I wasn't gonna get it processed have you ever seen that you know you sense something important but the boss just doesn't see it good luck that shuts down the organization's capacity to integrate and harness whatever it was that I tuned in to find the low-voltage light were in trouble so my quest since then has been how can we humans show up as sensors for our organizations and I did the only logical thing I was I became a boss this is more personal now how can I show up and to be a sensor for organization the only logical thing once I realized that anything I sensed that the boss didn't wasn't gonna get address well I became a boss right that's nice and simple now I get to really run things the way I think they should be you know and unfortunately I realized there was still another boss you know so after climbing the corporate ladder a bit I got fed up with that and realized all right the only way I'm really going to be able to process anything my sense is if I drop out of this whole game and start my own company where I get to be the CEO at the top and now there's no boss getting in the way of processing whatever it is I'm sensing so I did that I started a software company and built it over many years and you know at first that worked great I could get a lot of the stuff I sensed processed but then something unfortunate happened I realized well I'm not even able to even as the CEO as this company's growing I'm not even able to take everything that I see and get it processed the systems are not responsive enough right the way we've structured and built our organizations today doesn't let me even as the CEO get everything I sense integrated and harnessed and processed and that wasn't actually the worst of it the far more painful realization was I had just built the very system that I had struggled so long and tried to move past right now everyone else in that company didn't get whatever it was that they could tune into and sense harnessed and integrated unless I saw it and no matter how much I might work on myself focus on my own development try to be the most empowering servant leader I can be the reality is I'm still a human I still have bad days I still miss things right and I had built the very system that I had tried to escape so my question then shifted a bit it became how do I build something different and how do I build a system where that isn't the case where anything since by anyone can integrate and change the organization to help it better express whatever work it's doing in the world so one of the things we Attention realized is there's incredible energy there in the things we sense when we tune in to a gap between where we are and what could be right we call this attention because we often sense it as tension right that it's not just intellectual it's that feeling in your gut the frustration that comes when you see a process that you know could be better or you're banging your head into the same damn problem multiple times you feel tense you feel this tension about it could also be an opportunity if something exciting but it's this gap between where we are and where you sense we could be and just like a rubber band stretched between two points there is such energy there although we often Tension experience it as a negative I don't mean it that way at all and if we can do something with it becomes energy not frustration right the root of the word tension in Latin tense era means to stretch it's a stretch so how can we power an organization fuel its continual evolution its continual updating how it works and how we work together based on these tensions that we sense so interesting question hard thing to do and we tried a lot of things so we experimented over years we tried running an organization via consensus seemed like a good idea at the time it was a complete disaster if you ever want to sit in long painful meetings all the time and never get anything done try running your organization with consensus what I realized was there's a Consensus big difference between having a voice and actually being able to do something with your voice being able to actually process everything you sense into some kind of meaningful change consensus didn't do it in fact often that would result in long painful meetings where we all tried to get everyone to see it the same way I don't want my low voltage light to have to see things the same way as my fuel gauge I don't need that and it's not a healthy system in fact I want to let each of them sense what they can sense best and all integrate into the flight plan so how can we have an organization where any tension sense by anyone anywhere in the company has someplace to go to get rapidly and reliably processed into meaningful change that was the question consensus didn't work so we tried other things and we started finding approaches we started coming up with something and one of the first things we realized on that journey is we actually need to harness autocratic Harness autocratic authority the very thing we moved away from in the beginning right autocratic authority because if we're sensing on behalf of the organization and we want to be dynamic and fast and responsive which we have to be to process everything everyone senses most of the things we sense we need to act on locally we need to be not just sensors but actors in this system and to do that we need the authority to act without having to go to a painful meeting and try to get everybody bought into every decision you want to make in Cells in the human body other words we need to be a lot more like cells in the human body each one needs a clear boundary within which it has autonomy that has authority but what you don't see is a CEO cell right a manager cell directing the others what to do each cell has its own autonomy but it's distributed that's the direction we moved in a system where everybody has autocratic authority but they know the bounds of their authority they know the interconnections they know when they have to get somebody else's input or when they have to integrate with someone they know the bounds of their authority and the connections they know what they The process can expect of each other and in most organizations we have managers to fill the central point to do that to align all of us and to distribute authority but we've already covered the limits of that so how can we do that without managers in the way well for that we need a process if we don't have managers to align and integrate we need a process which aligns and integrates a process which lets each of us be a sovereign autonomous agent on behalf of this organization and its purpose and integrate in other words we need something that's a lot less like a feudal hierarchy and a lot more like a constitutional entity and that's exactly what we have so in my organization I work in every day I get to experience this it's quite liberating in my organization now we have no CEO we have no managers every individual partner in that firm has real authority that no one else can trump but it's distributed we each have different authority and we know the bounds and the limits of each and we have a constitution that defines how we integrate together a constitution that defines a governance process which is not governed of the people by the people for the people but rather is governance of the organization through the people as sensors for the purpose whatever it is we're here to do together when we have that kind of tangible system real processes that hold and distribute real Authority and integrate us and figure out how do we need to interconnect and align expectations when that process allows everyone to have a voice for the sake of the purpose and when you have a process to integrate anything you sense Conclusion anything you sense whatsoever any constraint on expressing this this purpose in the world and you can integrate it and change and reshape the organization dynamically in real time reshape how we work together what authority everyone has you've got a system that's dramatically more responsive and adaptable without the waste of managers in the way limiting what tensions you can process all of this we've captured in what we call a new social technology for organizations it's a new operating system it's tangible that constitutions available on our website and you can find it you can find organizations running with it all over the world now it's spreading is called holacracy you can find more at our website holacracy org and learn a bit more about how this system aligns us to each to the purpose each of us to the purpose while giving us the freedom and autonomy and yet an integrated whole thank you
Teaching ourselves to last forever,Matt Henderson,"Uh here's my big what if what if what we're teaching kids and how we're teaching kids doesn't make for a better world uh I'm a teacher um You probably thought I was an oral surgeon or something but no I'm a teacher any teachers out there teachers in the crowd yeah Big Ups big ups for the teachers uh any people go to school okay so common framework here that's really that's really good in my classroom I have Maps everywhere I have tons of maps everywhere of countries of provinces uh I don't know anything about geography I'm a joke in my department uh the only thing I know about geography is the term Oxbo Lake you guys know what an oxbow lake is yeah okay and uh I slide that in everywhere I'll be at a dinner party and I'll slide in oxbow lake and like you would be surprised at the distance it gives you but anyway one day I'm in my classroom I'm packing up uh it's like 5:00 I'm I've had it I'm done the whole thing laptop goes in the bag and I'm walking out of my classroom and right by my uh wall or on my wall right by my door is a map of Manitoba you know sort of the generic free map you can get Highway and transportation gives you and for some I for some reason I stop and I come back and I'm like wow there's Manitoba uh I don't know why I did it and so you know Keystone shape Saskatchewan is over here Ontario is over here uh the United States are down here kind of thing and I was like okay there's Manitoba populated areas in the South not so much in the north pre-cambrian Shield the whole thing uh but then I started to look closer and I started to look at or I started to notice First Nations communities everywhere I started to notice uh lakes and rivers named after first and second world War veterans uh I started to notice uh communities from the Hudson Bay days and the Northwest Company days and what I realized was Manitoba wasn't these boundaries that was fiction right that that's a concept uh what I found though was that Manitoba was this living breathing entity and when I looked deeper I could find that and that got me thinking about how I teach kids and what I teach kids and what I realized was that I was conditioning kids I was indoctrinating them right I was telling them truth that I was told from my teacher right here's the truth it's on the board shut up there's a test next week and so I was passing those on things like GDP that's a great way to look at the health of a country or infinite growth isn't that great or colonialism that's something that happened in the past and I was perpetuating these things right and at first I thought well it can't be me I'm pretty clever so I said a I bet it's the curriculum right there's some fuddy duddy making curriculum in an office right cardigan sweater the whole thing out of sync with what kids do and but then I looked at the curriculum and I was like no it's wicked the curriculum's awesome in Manitoba the science and social studies in particular it allows kids to explore think critically all that kind of great stuff that we're trying to do and so I said okay it's not the curriculum it's got to be us teachers and so I went around my school and I started looking at what teachers are doing ripping what off what they're doing like that's a good idea um and I and I said it's not the teachers because the teachers are passionate they want kids to learn they're fired up they come to work every day they're ready to they're ready to go so I was like it's not the teachers and I was like oh it's got to be the kids right blame it on the kids right let's do that and so I I looked at the kids like no no no no it's not the kids the kids want us to engage them they want us to inspire them right the kid with his head on the table drooling is like teach me something that's relevant and so it was me right it was me I was like man I'm a bad teacher and that was like a punch in the stomach I was like I'm just giving these kids models and Concepts not truths that aren't sustainable and they're just going to perpetuate it and that's bad right CU is our world in a can we agree that our world is in a bit of a crisis environmentally politically economically yeah so we're just going to keep doing the same thing and so I came to this realization that we need to get kids creating their own knowledge they need to create their own knowledge and further it and then the next step they need to apply it they need to apply it in the real world they need to affect change in their Community now not at the end of grade 12 where we say now become a citizen they need to start practicing now and it's my contention that we need as teachers whether you're in a school or you're a parent or you're teaching dental surgeons that we need to create um environments uh of autonomy and what I mean by autonomy is that kids are thinking critically they're creating their own knowledge they're developing empathy they're making ethical decisions and then they're allowed to apply it in the real world getting out of the school getting into their Community I came to this realization uh sort of had this aha moment um last year about 22 kids in my grade n social studies class they came up to me and asked me if I would run as their candidate for Member of Parliament right and I was like you know okay whatever you know okay sure that sounds great but let's step back when I first met these kids in September uh right away I knew that we were a cool learning community and I used that term purposely a learning community because I was part of it we would look at the schedule and say yeah we got social studies tomorrow this is Wicked what are we going to do what are we going to deconstruct what myth are we going to deconstruct and we looked at the uh economy we looked at the environment we looked at um the political system and as we started looking at this instead of deconstructing stuff the kids started getting really annoyed that they were excluded from our democracy right they weren't allowed to participate in it and one day in October or November uh a kid said hey Mr Henderson wouldn't it be cool if we got like a grade 12 kid when they turned 18 to be our puppet and they ran in the election and we could and we could do the whole sort of uh you know create the platform and I was like yeah that'd be really cool good luck with that right um January comes around and we you know we're looking at all things political and we see that our minority government might be falling for a variety of reasons not because of the budget okay and you know we're like oh man the kids keep bringing it up yeah we should do this I'm like right on find your grade 12 student okay good luck and then April comes around and we see that we're going to be coming to an election and the kids came up to me and they said Mr Henderson we still want to do this and I said right on who's your grade 12 student like you know who's the Unlucky guy or girl and they said well would you do it I was like ah you know I could see my principal's face she's wicked awesome my principal but I could just see it like I don't know man um and I said uh why mean she and the kids are like well you got a car that helps right and you're going to show up on time to stuff right and I was like okay that that's pretty high praise and I was like I was like I don't know I don't know about this I'm going to give you a test and they're like okay sure what's the test and I said tonight you got to download the nomination package from elections Canada which is huge I don't know if anybody's done this before uh and you got to get it all filled out you got to get 200 signatures from the community imagine going to your door my teacher is going to run for Member of Parliament right uh and you got to get it all filled out we got to get a check you got to get $1,000 to participate in our democracy right and you got to bring it back if you don't do it I'm out but if you do it I'm in and I thought aha I got them cuz there's no way they're going to do this there's no way they're going to do this at all next day pouring rain right super wet these kids come from lunch they'd been into the local community at lunch which they shouldn't have been um they've got makeup all over their face the Soggy hair they had this soggy elections cada package dripping but it was all filled out they had done it in like 24 hours and I was like okay here we go let's do it and it was just for the first time in my life I had given up control of my classroom and the kids did it and they learned about how to nominate somebody in a federal election in Canada how many people here know how to do that oh yeah okay put your hand down okay but geek um but these kids are 15 and so we were off and running right we're off and running and now it was like oh we got to put a platform together okay so we're like What should we be on our Platform One kid's like we should PL more trees I'm like okay um but as a teacher I'm like well I got to guide them right so I said kids what have we learned this year Well we learned about the justice system when we were really into restorative justice oh okay well why don't we make that part of our platform okay uh we really want to do something about the Senate right all these cronies that get dumped into the Senate okay we we'll look at doing some Senate reform and on and on and we went we started creating this massive platform kids with ideologies all over the place and it was this beautiful thing okay now I know what you're thinking oh this is a great project but where's the rigor right when I went to school I had to write papers and tests and stuff like that and it wasn't fun that's the doesn't that mean we're learning right this was the most rigorous thing I'd seen 15-year-old kids do they yeah you know what we had to fight over a platform we had committees that built websites social media all that kind of stuff they got grilled by Winnipeg Free Press reporters they were uh on CPAC talking to CPAC reporters they were going to community events they were going to mosques they were going to debates and not all the parties went to our debates rhymes with schaive okay you get my drift okay and it was I mean and they wrote papers right we did blogs we did all this stuff and at the end of the day I even gave them a mark right and it was rigorous and I you I was like here here's your mark and they're like oh Mark what for what right it was this beautiful moment where these kids created their own knowledge their own truths not for me right I didn't give them the hippie dippy stuff they did it themselves and then they applied it immediately and that got me thinking I'm like maybe I could do this all the time right wouldn't this be cool so I started doing little things my American history kids last year they wanted to or they didn't like the textbook I'd brought them Howard's in of people's history right I thought Oh They'll love this and they're just like n okay and they said well why can't we write our own textbook and I was like okay let's write our own textbook so we wrote WR our own textbook and we publish it now a 16-year-old kid said I did history this is my history and it was this beautiful thing my Canadian history kids this year are writing short stories on colonialism and exploration which is launched April 11th at mcnali Robinson okay my grade ns are Mak they have a podcast series on human rights violations in the world okay these kids are creating their own truths their nuggets and then they're applying them in their Community to affect change now and that's fundamentally important now how does this fit with new pedagogy we know that we know that kids don't learn with the sage at the stage that's fine once in a while sometimes you have to tell a kid what an oxbow lake is Right an oxbow lake is this okay but they learn in so many different ways and however you get there whatever however you teach kids you have to allow them to explore things for themselves and you have to create that environment for autonomy okay and then the key is you have to let them apply it because if they're not going to apply it you might as well just give them the worksheet okay and at the great at the end of grade 12 you might as well say okay hope you can hope you learn some stuff now try and apply everything okay doesn't make sense now how do we do this there's three ways to do this according to me okay whatever that means right number one is take uh I say take a little bit off the power pedal as teachers okay take a little bit off the gas you don't need to be in charge of everything that happens in uh your classroom you have to guide make sure things are safe make sure kids are able to seek out what's significant you have to tell them how to do research you have to model these things okay but sometimes uh the kids need to be in charge of that learning community God forbid the second thing is as a teacher you need to be able to take risks sometimes the stuff that we do in my classroom is terrible and it doesn't work and I'm like uh guys and we look at each other this isn't working this is terrible but they like that they're like holy cow we tried something and we failed at it uh but Mr Henderson he's an adult and he failed to oh okay I get it it's okay and the third thing we need to do is cultivate this environment for autonomy we need to give the kids space we need to allow them to think critically to create that knowledge together okay not in little Styles we need to have them do it together we need them to develop empathy we need them to practice to make ethical decisions and F the biggest thing here is they need to be able to apply that knowledge let's do a little teacher thing I'm going to get you to do let's try and create some knowledge you guys want to create some knowledge you've been sitting there all day yeah okay big props to the person and I want you all to try this okay deep breath I got a I got a minute here okay how is education like an oxbow lake okay talk to your partner I'll give you 10 seconds if you can come up with it you win the Tweet of the day how what's an oxbow lake Google it man okay anybody got anything a curve lake formed at a former Ox where the main am of the river has cut across endow there you go we don't need to know anything anymore isn't brilliant right but how is education like an oxbow lake anyone want it's what's left over after the course is run you guys like that right on thank you very much thank you very much I hope that that was an idea worth spreading thank you"
Como tratar con gente difÃ­cil,Miguel Furque,"Good morning, how are you all? I see you are calm. I will try to tell you how I have done over the years to learn to, I don't know if I learned, but at least I keep trying to deal with difficult people. Today I was thinking that it's been almost 20 years, I will turn 20 years since my first lesson on how to deal with difficult people. December 15, 1993. You might say, why does he remember that date? Because I got married on December 30, 1993. It's a date, a milestone date in people's lives. And 15 days before going to the altar, I realized that I couldn't deal with difficult people. I got angry one day at my job, I got very angry at my job. And 15 days before getting married, being a tremendous poor person at that time, I was poorer than I am now, I decided not to go back to my job. I got so angry that I didn't go back anymore. I had a boss named Don Alfredo, who is now with his feet forward, unfortunately. I say unfortunately because I would have preferred to continue learning from him. He was a very, when I say very, I mean very difficult person. So I got so angry that I took an attitude, an attitude that was the beginning of my learning. At that time I learned something that someone later put a label on and said, that's the triad of attitude, where you went through, you chose, or in that case, I chose to leave my job. And I say why I chose that attitude, to do that, because I felt that person, Don Alfredo, disrespected me. I felt pride, impotence, fear, anger. I felt that, but from where did it start? That I thought that man was wrong. I thought he was x, and for me, he was y. I thought he had different reasons, and those reasons were not equitable, they were not fair, and I was wrong. So what did I learn? This thing about the triad of attitude. We do things because we have felt something, but at the same time, that feeling has been thought by us. And this is basic, the first principle of what I want to leave you. No one, no one, no one can make life impossible for someone unless you want it. If I had learned this on December 15, 1993, of course, I would have gotten married anyway, but very likely, I wouldn't have had to give so many explanations before my wedding. Imagine during the wedding and the honeymoon, I won't even tell you. No one understood how a guy 15 days before getting married could do such a thing. Because I thought something, I felt something about that person, and at that moment, and I acted accordingly. No one, absolutely no one, can make our life impossible unless we want it. Why? Because we act based on what we think and feel. If I tell you, you go home and you are parents, and a child opens the door, or a sibling, and says, ""Dad, it's good that you came. I'm hungry, Dad, I have no food. Dad,"" and then you go to the fridge, open the fridge, it's empty, you put your hand in your pocket and say, ""Wow, I didn't bring any money, but we are hungry, Dad."" Tell me if any of you didn't feel something here inside, based on where I take you. You think, feel, and based on what you feel, you act. So, when I am clear that no one can make my life impossible unless I want it, it is easy to understand why we can somehow handle that situation. We can hardly change people. We can't yet. Maybe technology will allow it in the future, but today we can't. Today we can make a decision. I can't change people. I can't remove a bad thought or eliminate a bad thought. It is very difficult, and listen to me, it is very difficult to remove a bad thought. It is very difficult about something or someone. What is easy, very easy, is to change it. When you go to a gym and train, one, two, three, four times a week, your muscles grow. The same thing happens with our way of thinking. If we train ourselves to think positively, our thinking muscle or capacity to think grows. If we think well, we feel well, and we act well. So, what ends up happening is that very few people can influence our lives. I say my life is like a movie, and I see it like a movie. I have to live it like a movie. And I say in my life, there is this protagonist, I am a protagonist of my life, and I am sure that in your lives, each one of you is a protagonist. There are also supporting actors, guest actors, extras, and also villains. Difficult people, the villains, are also good to have in our lives because they teach us to grow, they teach us techniques to deal with them, they help us push our limits and see how we react to those limits. I can't conceive a life without villains; it would be extremely boring. Imagine a life without someone making your life impossible. So, sometimes I ask people, ""Who is difficult?"" And they say, ""For me, my life is full of them, like 30."" Oh my, then who is the difficult one, them or you? When we have to deal with difficult people, I say we have many options, and one technique I have learned, I learned from kids. I have children, one 16, one 13, at some point they were little, 4 or 5 years old. Since I don't have siblings, I didn't have nephews, so I learned from them. I'm talking about 14 years ago, I learned this, that my kids were smarter than me in dealing with difficult people. When Uncle Jorge came, an uncle they never liked, I don't know if they didn't like him, they didn't have a feeling for Uncle Jorge. Uncle Jorge arrived, and the kids left. I said, ""Wow, you don't need to go to Harvard."" Now that it is trendy, you don't need to go to Harvard, just watch the kids you have at home. My kids taught me about children's wisdom. If there are difficult people, do what kids do, leave, and the problem is solved. Adults complicate things, you meet a difficult person, and you're like, ""Let's see, let's see what this person did to me, yeah, I will cross paths with them, they bother me, I will bother them."" That's what adults do. Kids, children's wisdom, they leave. So, we somehow have to learn that children's wisdom is a resource for dealing with difficult people. And you know from another person I learned a lot from and have had close since 1988, that's why I say it's been a long time. I think I've been preparing this talk since then. Since 1988, in August 1988, I met my wife, and my wife is passionate about dealing with people with problems, language problems. Since I met her, she comes home every day and tells me with more frequency and intensity, ""You know, I see that people, and kids,"" she works with kids with language problems, ""they have problems because their families have difficult contexts, divorced parents, parents who fight, siblings who don't talk, family breakdown."" And she tells me this every day, not just because she has cases like this, but because she has a lot of them. So, what did I learn? Another thing I learned, I learned from my wife, I didn't have to go anywhere else. I learned that behind every difficult person, there is a difficult story. And be careful, you have to uncover those stories. How am I going to deal with a difficult person if I don't know why they are difficult? People are rarely difficult; they are having a difficult time. Something happened that day that changed their state of mind, their emotions. Behind every difficult person, there is a difficult story. Think about it, when you come home at night, hungry, imagine me, a good eater, after a long day without eating. How do you think I get home? Like a difficult person. But what's behind this difficult person? A difficult story, 12 hours of work, little time for lunch, inadequate refreshments. So, what ends up happening is that even physiologically, we have problems that turn us into difficult people, not just for us, but for others. So, it's important for you to review that behind every difficult person, there is a difficult story. Unfortunately, families break more and more, the family institution breaks down, and that creates difficult stories. So, I believe we will increasingly have to learn how to deal with difficult people. I don't have any secrets, but I have one very important one. I believe we must carry a little package of affection, care, love in our pockets. Why? Because difficult people need to be treated with care. Think about Jesus. Wow, when Jesus chose the apostles, he didn't choose the best from the town, that's a lie. He chose tough guys, but what did he do? He accepted them and loved them as they were, and then he could help them, and they helped. Think about it, since then, people used affection pills. I can't think of changing someone if I don't accept and love them as they are. If I enter that path, I won't achieve anything. If I follow the path of not caring about people, not caring about those who don't serve me, I won't achieve anything. I'm not talking about work or family; I'm talking about life in general, in any role we have. We need to accept and love people, even if they are difficult and have difficult stories. We all have difficult people, yes, and we all have difficult people. But what happens if that difficult person, you can't apply children's wisdom because they live with you? Children's wisdom would be that each of us leaves every day, but we can't. And if they live with you? What if it's your wife, your husband, your boss, with whom you share many hours of your life? You can leave your boss, but your wife? Well, you can leave her too, but that's not what we seek. You can leave your father, your mother, your children, but if they live with you, what do you do? What do you do if they live with you? Look, one thing I've learned over time is that if they live with you and we take the wrong path, which is to scold the other person to change them, and I tell my wife, change, change, change, I don't like what you do, and I don't like it, and I tell my child, stop fooling around, you've been studying for ten days, and you get bad grades, that's not how people change. If the first day I tell someone, look, I don't like what you do, the first day, okay. But if the next day I say, I don't like it, and such and such, the next day, it happens less, the third day, again, and so on, by the fourth day, it goes in one ear and out the other. That's the wrong path. If I want to generate results and change the attitude of the people I live with, I have to do something key, key. I call it the key to not hurting their intelligence or dignity. So, for example, my wife comes one day and says, ""You know what? Today, look what happened, I left all this dirt on the floor."" ""Yes, you always do the same thing, I've been telling you for three years not to leave dirty clothes on the floor because I'm organized."" A few days later, I realize I was wrong. ""Gorda, forgive me, I had a bad day, sorry."" And then a few days later, again, ""Gorda, you left all the clothes on the floor, how long will it take?"" And we start again, ""Sorry, gorda, excuse me, in the office, they scolded me, clients fight with me, people don't like me."" What ends up happening when I continue this? It breaks. Then I find myself with my wife talking about things like, ""Why isn't our relationship the same as before?"" ""It's not the same as before because I've hurt your dignity."" So I want you to take away from here some very basic rules. One, behind a difficult person, there is always a difficult story. And most importantly, to enter a difficult person and somehow understand them, you have to accept and love them. The key to entering a difficult person's heart is exclusively their virtues, recognizing their virtues and not focusing on their defects. Before finishing, I always like to give you something. So I decided to leave you more than a gift, a wish, and a wish that comes from an old Irish blessing, which says the following: ""May the road rise to meet you. May the wind always be at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face. May the rains fall soft upon your fields. And until we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of His hand.""  "
The Honest Truth About Dishonesty,Dan Ariely,Dan arieli is our next speaker talking uh the honest truth about dishonesty how we lie to everyone especially ourselves the James bduk professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University uh got two New York Times bestseller predictably irrational and the honest truth about dishonesty and his H coup is this I have never lied except for what I just said wait thats not true please welcome Dan areli so I want to talk little bit about dishonesty and how many people here have lied at least once this year okay how about the last We lie lot week Im not going to ask about the last day and the last hour but there very disturbing study in which they take two people who dont know each other put them in room and say talk to each other for 10 minute introduce yourself to the other person and then they put them into separate room and say did you lie to the other person and almost everybody say and they say well luckily we take your discussion let play back to you sentence by sentence and let get your reaction to each sentence and on average people admit to lie between two and three time in those 10 minute so if you think about it the truth is that we lie lot we lie frequently lot of it is for um to be polite or for social Grace and so on by the way there there story in the Bible God come to Sarah and say Sarah youre going to have and Sarah Li laugh s she said how can I have when my husband is so old God said dont worry then go to Abraham and say Abraham youre going to have and Abraham say did you tell Sarah and God said yes and Abraham said and what did Sarah said and God lie God said Sarah said how could she have when she is so old and the religious Scholars have wondered how could God lie and they came up with the conclusion that it okay to lie for peace at home Human value and and the realization of course is that there are many human value out there honesty is one of them but not all human value are compatible all the time and what do we do with sometimes human value dont fit something to give and honesty often give and we understand that right we all understand that the right answer to the question honey how do I look in that dress is not always the perfect truth so on one hand we realize we tell lot of lie and we do it for all kind of Social and other reason on the other hand how many people in here in general think of yourself wonderful honest people right the same the same group who uh and the question is how can that be Mechanisms for lying how can it be that on one hand we lie and we recognize that on the other hand we feel good about ourselves what are the mechanism for lying so to look at this honesty in general we have to come up with some method that we could quantify this honesty and we kind of developed very simple approach um if youre in the experiment in one of the many experiment we run uh one of the method look like the following I would give you sheet of paper with 20 simple math problem these are math problem that everybody could solve if you had enough time but I wouldnt give you enough time I would pas the sheet along I would say wait I said turn it over solve many of those you can in five minute Ill give you dollar per question you have five minute go you would start working fast you can at the end of the five minute I would say please stop put your pencil down and count how many question you got correctly now take your sheet of paper go to the back of the room and shred it come to the front tell how many question you got correctly and Ill pay you accordingly people do this they shred they come forward they said they solve six problem on average I paid them 6 they go home what the people in the experiment dont know is that we played with shredder talking about dishonesty um the shredder Shred the side of the page but the main body of the page remains intact so when you put your in you feel the vibration the noise Everything feel the right way but we can actually see how many question people really solve correctly and what do you think we find on average people solve four problem and report to be solving six and this is this shift in the average is not due to few people cheat lot it due to lot of little cheater Ill tell you about lot of experiment today and I there many I would not tell you about in total weve run these experiment on about 35000 people and from those 35000 people we found about 20 who were big cheater and together they stole about 250 from u we also found 25000 little cheater who stole about 50000 from u and I want you to think about that sure there are big cheater out there Little cheater but there are very few of them but on the other hand there lot of little cheater who could cheat just little bit all the time and that actually tremendous economic impact okay so now we have method for quantifying dishonesty now let think about what is the theory of dishonesty the standard theory of dishonesty is the cost benefit analysis it say every time youre considering an act you say to yourself what do I extend to gain what do I Costbenefit analysis extend to lose um if you think about stealing something you say whats the probability Ill be caught how much time will I get in prison is it worth it and you do the cost benefit analysis now if thats the case all we need to do is to do harsh punishment and people would do the cost benefit analysis and would say not worth it but is that the case so first of all let think about something like the death penalty the death penalty is very harsh penalty it hard to think about something worse and you would think to yourself that if people do the cost benefit analysis state that have the death penalty would not have crime at least not the crime that you can get death penalty for but any statistical anal is that we can do doesnt show any difference in crime rate between state that have the death penalty and state that dont suggesting people dont really do the cost benefit analysis you can also ask yourself subjectively when wa the last time you thought about the the world this way you must have gone to some friend for dinner and maybe you went to the bathroom to wash your hand and they have these really new nice towel and you know you dont have nice towel and you had your backpack with you and you could have taken them and gone home did you ever think think about thing like like this right I suspect that most of you have it right it hasnt crossed your mind maybe now tonight maybe well luse lot of Experiment result Cutlery at the dinner or something but in general we dont think about thing like this so it doesnt seem to describe the macro data it doesnt seem to describe the subjective experience what about our experiment our experiment show the same thing we play with how much money people stand to gain we dont see difference we stand with how much whats the probability of being caught we dont seem difference so the economic rational model while seems appealing if people do the cost benefit analysis doesnt have much evidence in our data or in any other data so what doe happen because you could say oh people are angel but people are not angel either right we do see lot of dishonesty so we thought maybe whats going on is that people try to maximize two thing at the same time on one hand we want to look at oursel in the mirror and we want to feel that were good honest wonderful people like in ego utility think of oursel in good way on the other hand we want to benefit from selfishly from cheating little bit and you could say you cant do both you either look at yourself an honest person or you benefit from being slightly dishonest you cant do both well maybe you can maybe long we cheat just little bit we can still think of ourselves good people right maybe there barrier that say that if you cheat lot you have to think of yourself thief but if you cheat just little bit all of sudden you can think of yourself in in still in good eye so for example how many of you have illegally download material in your Not everybody computer okay not everybody actually I guess some people just dont know how to do it and from the people who have this uh this information how many of you would feel bad if other people knew almost right how can it be now If other people knew think about something else how many of you would feel comfortable going and having meal in restaurant and living without pain you would feel comfortable good to know and most of you say you would not feel comfortable Im guessing you you just so actually in the last few year Living without paying every time I go to eat somewhere I ask the waiter if they Rec can recommend way to eat and Escape without paying and I usually say look Im not going to do it Im just interested like how would you do it if you were going to do it uh sometimes they ask for my credit card but usually they give really good advice they say wait for big group to come in there an alley there bathroom they have suggestion of how to do it and then I say what how often doe it happen and they say almost never say they say sometimes people forget to pay they just because they dont pay attention to the credit card they start working without paying but they say it almost never happens now think about these two case illegal downloads eating without paying the probability of being caught is very low in both of them illegal downloads if the music industry catch you you cant say oh I didnt think about it Im sorry I didnt pay attention which you could do in restaurant nevertheless it how we feel about it it not about the consequence How to modulate cheating in the real world so let go back to our little experiment and say how would we now modulate the amount of cheating that happens in our experiment how do we get people to cheat more and how do we get people to cheat and remember it not about the cost benefit analysis what else would get people to change their tolerance around cheating and if you think about that it all about thinking of ourself good people and trying to benefit from dishonesty it all about rationalization it all about saying how can we justify this little bit of cheating and if we could justify little bit more then we will cheat more and if we could justify little bit we would feel so let Rationalization think about rationalization what kind of thing do you think change rationalization what kind of thing are good input that allow people to rationalize more just raise your hand and give some Anonymousness suggestion anity anonymity so anonymity is usually the the multiple interpretation but one of them I cant be caught and another one is you dont think of yourself part of you think of yourself part of crowd very good what everybody else doe it everybody else doe let tell you one experiment about everybody else doe it then will continue all all are good let just uh let just tell you about experiment at time and then well continue with suggestion so one of the suggestion wa everybody else is doing it so imagine it the same experiment I pas the sheet around but there are two change the first change is that I give you an envelope with all the money for the experiment in advance if you solve all the problem and they asked you at the end to pay back the money you did not make change number two is I hire an acting student that acting student sits in the front row and 30 second into the experiment they raise their hand and they say excuse I solved everything what do I do now imagine youre in the experiment somebody raised their hand they so I solved everything you know that theyre cheating there question youre still in problem number one and the experimentor said you solved everything youre free to go and you see that person taking their envelope and walking leaving nothing behind what would happen to your own morality lot more people cheat but there could be couple of interpretation one interpretation is that youre saying well in this experiment there downside to cheating look somebody cheated in an exaggerated way all the way nobody chased him nobody said anything it it there consequence the other possibility is to say in our society People Like Us seem to behave like this and this seems to be okay socially so how do we separate those two explanation we tried multiple thing one of them wa that we changed the outfit of the acting student and here the story we ran this experiment at kigy melon everybody wa melon student the acting student wa kigy melon student wa wearing Cony melon outfit in the second version of the experiment wa wearing University of Pittsburgh sweat now what happens when you university of kig melon student and you see University of Pittsburgh student cheat from the cost benefit analysis you still know that in this experiment people can Che get away with it but from the perspective of feeling okay that people like are doing it that doesnt work now you say oh it these other people they are the cheater and we dont want to be like them and cheating actually go down okay so it is about everybody else is doing it but people like rather than everybody in general people that we identify with um you said The Boston Experiment they deserve it yeah because restaur Char too theyre charging too much we can go into all kind of personalization you might have about this um so so theyre doing something bad to so we did another version of this experiment this wa in Boston we came to people in coffee shop and we say hey would you did do this study for five minute for 5 people said yes we get in the sheet and we explained to them the task it wa slightly different than the the task I described to you and then we said well be back in 5 minute left came back in 5 minute said here are your 5 please count it and sign receipt for 5 and leave the receipt on the table but we actually gave them 9 how many bostonian do you think gave u the money back slightly more than 50 and you can decide if it lot or little in the second condition the research assistant explain to them the task here is what you do pretend somebody called him on his cell phone picked up his phone and talked for 12 second to John about pizza tonight hey John whats up pizza tonight great put the phone back went straight to explaining this instruction said nothing left 9 here your five what happens now now only 14 of the people gave the money back right people said oh did something bad to it okay now Im restoring Karma to the World by by doing that very good so other people are doing it what else would change rationalization just raise your hand yeah The identifiable victim effect thats right so youre not stealing anything so when we talk about illegal downloads there lot of way to rationalize it right you could say Im not there marginal cost you could say the musician really want the music to be heard I wouldnt buy it otherwise Im actually doing something good there lot of story you can tell yourself what else personal relationship personal relationship do you mean that if you know the person face to face you might not want to to harm them when you dont know them face to face you would feel differently about it absolutely thats right so there something called the identifiable victim effect which is if if it the effect is larger and it happen hurt people in general you dont feel the effect if it something specific you feel it Ill give you one oh yeah lar organization verus small organization lar you know we tried that we couldnt find evidence for that but I I felt the same intuition we we just didnt find evidence for this so here another version of this um there little joke that little Johnny come home from school with note from the teacher that said that little Johnny stole pencil from the kidu sitting next to him and Johnnys father is furious and said Johnny I cant believe you did it and you never never never steal pencil from the kid who sitting next to you youre grounded for 2 week and just waiting till you mother come and beside Johnny you know very well that if you need pencil all you need to do is to say something you can mention it you can ask for pencil and I can bring you dozen of pencil from the office now why is this slightly amusing The pencil analogy because I think we all recognize that the pencil feel very differently from taking 50 cent for petty cash boox if you took 50 cent from petty cash boox you would feel like youre thief pencil not so much right everybodys doing it it there for people to take in fact even if you took 50 cent and went to buy pencil you would feel yourself that that youre thief so this idea here is that the distance between what we do and the consequence the the people and so on is is major aspect of whether we feel comfortable or not so weve done this in couple of way the first one is we looked at golf anybody here play golf okay few people so we did study about about 12000 golf player we asked them many question but one question wa imagine the ball fell on the rough not good place and you really really really wanted it to be 4 in to the left would have been much better would you pick it up and move it by 4 in and people said heaven forbid I cant imagine doing that if you asking this question it mean you dont understand golf nobody know about Nobody Does it impossible not part of the game okay what about kicking the ball little bit yeah we do that all the Laughter time what about hitting it with club thats easy too by the way the easiest one is if youre not looking so you look up and then you kick it little bit thats the thats the easiest going back to the standard experiment we did the same experiment I described to you earlier we passed the sheet of paper people shreded them came to and said Mr experimental I solved X problem give xll in another version they looked at the experiment and said Mr experiment I solved X problem give X token and we pay them in piece of plastic they walk 12 Fe to the side and change them for money so the difference wa when you look into somebody in the eye and you lied you lied from something that wa not money but it wa going to become money very quickly what happened in that this experiment people people double their cheating and by the way this for is one of the most worrisome experiment that weve created because if you think about it society were becoming distant distant from direct relationship and distant from money cash credit card electronic wallet cash stock stock option derivative dealing with people directly dealing with people over great distance if it if it possible that these distance increase people feel better about misbehaving than we really to worry more and more about lot of people cheating little bit and still feeling good about themselves um if you think about everything weve said so far it really about conflict of interest it really about the fact that if we want to see reality in certain way and we have the condition to rationalize it we can do it so imagine for example that we create something like the financial industry in Wall Street and imagine that youre an investor in Wall Street in 2005 and I promise you 5 million bonus If You Could Only See mortgage back Securities good product now ask yourself whether you could see them better product than they really are Im not saying would you lie would you say oh I know that theyre terrible but Ill pas them to my client now wouldnt you actually shift your belief to believe that theyre better than they are and what if you have some belief in the market the market is always right and what if you said everybody else is doing it and what if there were multiple step removed from m in multiple Steps remov From the people that youre dealing with now you can see how you can create system that inherent conflict of interest and lot of opportunity for rationalization and matter who you put in there youre going to get bad outcome you know we can say oh this Banker is bad and this Banker is bad the problem is that the system is supporting lot of behavior um Ill tell you one other story about conflict of interest so you can probably tell I wa Bly burned many year ago I spent long time in hospital um and about 5 year after I left the hospital I came back for checkup and the head of the department find said Dan Im so happy you came I have fantastic new treatment for you great I come to his office and say that when I shave I have stubble I just shaved so not much I have stubble on my left side my right side is burned so there stubble there hair so what is proposing going to t to the right side of my face so that it equal the left side of my face and say go home shave tomorrow and come back and I drive home and I think to myself what kind of shave do I want to be symmetrical the morning shave the afternoon Shadow like you know this is the important decision so I come to his office and I said you know what Im not sure I want this can you show some picture of people youve done it said yes weve done it for two other people cant show the whole face but show their cheek and sure enough it look like you know little black dot and then I said what happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white you said dont worry we can laser it out when the time when the time come and then I said you know what Im not sure I want this Im not sure it for then look at said Dan whats wrong with you said do you enjoy looking non Deprived pleasure symmetrical do you get some dep derived pleasure from looking different said do woman feel sorry for you and you know said some other thing um which never An amazing physician happened and and I left I left his office and I wa really baffled and I went to his deputy and I said whats going on and said well you know weve done this for two patient already and we need third for an academic paper now here the thing this guy wa an amazing physician passed away 10 year ago but wa an amazing physician you see the right side of my right eyebrow it wa burned there wa eyebrow and wanted to operate on it wanted to create new eyebrow I couldnt care but I told him there wa another operation I wa going into if you want to do it at the time of the other operation thats fine Im not doing special operation I had about 30 operation another one for half an eyebrow didnt look like good deal to um so I went into an operation for my hand it took about 8 hour hour but turn out they couldnt couldnt do it didnt have enough space around so waited the whole day for them to finish and then worked on most of the night took him about 8 hour it very took Doppler machine tracked the blood vessel created really amazing operation I the point is that I cant think of this physician anything but kind wonderful person but at that moment had conflict of interest and at that moment wanted to see this paper out and careed about my individual benefit okay so all of this is about How to rationalize conflict of interest and how we could get people to rationalize more how can we get people to rationalize what do you think we get people to cheat so of course we could do the opposite of what weve done so far but what else could happen what else could work Commandments Ten Commandments very good so there little joke there little joke guy go to the rabbi and said Rabbi you wouldnt believe what happened but somebody stole my bicycle from synagogue and the RAB is appalled stealing your bicycle from synagogue that this is terrible so Ill tell you what you do come to synagogue next week and sit in the front row and we go over the Ten Commandments turn around and look at everybody in their arm and when we get to thou shall not steal you know who your thief the guy is very excited the rabbi is excited come to synagogue sit in the front row turn around doing the Ten Commandments at the end of the Serv service the rabbi wait for him and say so did it work and the guy said like magic like charm said the moment the moment we got to thou shall not commit adultery I remembered why I left my The California Effect bike thats whats needed to get Applause good to know so wheres the experiment in this wa suggested we went to UCLA and we asked 500 undergrad to try and recall the Ten Commandments uh by the way none of them could recall all Ten Commandments many of them invented new interesting one um this might be California effect we dont know um but then after we asked them to try and recall the Ten Commandments nobody cheated and it had nothing to do with whether they were remembered more Commandments or Commandments in fact even when we we ask self declared atheist to swear in the Bible and then we give them chance to cheat they cheat they dont cheat at all so it not about the cost benefit of heaven and hell it about reminding people about their own moral fiber and we did an experiment like this with the big insurance company we got some people to fill their adomat reading and then sign at the bottom and some people signed first and then fill theom to reading and the people who signed first cheated by much we dont know if they didnt cheat at all because we didnt check the odometer but compared to the other group we know they cheated by 15 so this suggest that just priming people with their own morality can do something good for dishonesty there there are two more point I I want to make um the first one is about what happens to dishonesty over time time so in these experiment that Ive described to you so far it wa the one short cheating people have one time but sometimes we give people hundred of opportunity to cheat over time and one of the thing we see is that people cheat little bit cheating little bit feeling good cheating little bit and then at some point they switch and start cheating 100 of the time and different people switch at different point but the switching pattern is very common and we call this the what the hell effect and and if youre Dieter you know this thing right you know that youre kind of on diet and then you start with muffin and you say Im not going to diet anymore Ill start tomorrow or next Monday and the issue is that we really think of ourself in binary term we either dieter or not we either honest or not if youre 72 honest doe it worth is it worthwhile to move to 78 you might well enjoy it so we said okay if people have this what the hell effect pattern how could we cure people what what how could you get over it in religious term if people think that theyre going to hell why would they ever why would they ever behave well so we thought about Catholicism anybody here grew up Catholic okay few so this is offense of the Catholics or the ex The Logic of Confession Catholics in the audience um but we want to talk to real Catholics we went to Italy we went to talk to Catholic priest and we asked them please explain to u the logic of confession after all if you can confess and get absolved wouldnt people cheat more if all you want is to minimize time in purgatory wouldnt you cheat on the way to confession just to but but turn out thats not the case so we came up with few theory for how confession might work one is the cost benefit you think to your future and you say I might get caught but for sure Ill have to talk to the priest and that will be terrible not worth it we find evidence for that the second possibility is you come out of confession and you feel good and pure and wonderful and you dont want to destroy that feeling for few day or few hour we have some evidence for that but what about the what the hell effect so we tried that well in the lab people cheated lot switch to cheating lot little cheated little bit switch to cheating lot we gave them chance for noncatholic confession write some thing youve done wrong write something that you ask forgiveness shred those piece of paper why what happens after both of those cheating go down dramatically so this is case in which religion actually figured some interesting mechanism about opening new page and I think it interesting to ask how could we integrate the general wisdom opening new page in into secular society what would it look like if we try to get our politician and banker uh into ceremony of that should we integrate thing when people reclaim their vow and do other thing to basically open new page and finally I want to say something about cultural difference difference how many people here grew up in country that is not the US raise your hand okay keep them up now how many of of you think that in your country of origin people cheat than Americans than Americans keep your hand up Canadian yeah yeah okay so so I grew up in Israel so the first country I went to test wa wa Israel we test with the same procedure how many of you think that in Israel people people cheat more than the Americans This is much more politically correct group than I expected anyway the Israel just like the Americans Franchesca Gino my Italian collaborator said come to Italy well show you what the Italians can do but the Italians treat just like the Americans we tried China we tried turkey Germany Colombia uh South America and so far we find difference how can it be anybody who traveled in other place get the feeling the cheating is very different in different place how can it be and here is what were finding we finding that our experiment are not capturing anything cultural because theyre not embedded in culture theyre abstract theyre General it the first time people experien them and because of that they measure the general ability of people to cheat little bit and feel good about themselves but that doesnt mean that culture doesnt work culture work on domain by domain specific culture doesnt change human Fabric or backbone what culture doe is to take domain illegal download and say dont worry about it culture can take something like paying bribe to policeman and say dont worry about it culture can take something like cheating in school and say dont worry about it so culture is important but culture doesnt change people across the domain they just change them across the whole domain they change domain by domain we did find one difference when we run these experiment we either run them at University or in bar and when we run them in bar we change the payment such that every four question people solve correctly they get the money equivalent to one glass of beer in this establishment so beer becomes our International currency so we ran this experiment in in bar where Congressional staffer hang out in and we read it also in bar where Bankers in New York Wall Street hang outting and this wa the only time we found difference who do you think cheated more the banker or the politician who vote for politician who vote for Bankers huh okay so slightly more for the politician the bank cheated 2 to one twice much but there are two thing we should consider one is that this wa cheating in money which is domain of Bankers much more than the politician and the second thing these were Junior politician Congressional staffer lot of room for growth let just finish with the following I told you little bit about Judaism and Catholicism guy go to confession and say forgive Father for I have sinned the father said what have you done my and said Im 72 year old and I just had sex with two 25y old twin and the priest is appalled said I cant believe this is happening I want you to say 700 time hell Mary and walk around the church thousand time and give 1000 to charity and how long it been since your last confession said Ive never been to confession what youre 72 year old and youve never been to confession how can that be Im Jewish so if youre Jewish what are you doing here and why are telling Im telling everybody dan arieli yeah Dan arieli
Hay un multimillonario en todos nosotros,John Kluge,"I'm here to talk to you about a simple idea. This idea is about how to become a billionaire. So, you might have a few ideas in your mind right now. Whatever is in there, I'd like you to just take a moment and let go of them, because I promise you that what I'm going to be talking about has nothing to do with the concept of billionaire as you know it today. Although it is really rewarding, so let's discover what this is. The current equation of success around the world based on, let's say our media, the majority of the stories that we see, is this: money makes the world go round. Well, I'm not so sure that's true. We essentially equate our success in life, or our professional success, on our financial capacity, right? On what we are able to achieve. The problem with this, is that, well... the arms trade for example, right? This is a really easy example. The arms trade makes roughly $40-$60 billion annually. That's a really lucrative business, and for anyone who is a part of that they're doing pretty well, based on our current model. The problem is that, these guns have lots of negative externalities, right? They don't exactly create life. And they definitely don't create happiness, at least not for most of us. So, what does this mean? How are we doing? If I was in grade school, my teacher would give me an F based on our score. And I think that we can do a lot better. We have so many huge challenges around the world: from poverty to extremism, to resource competition and availability, to massive inequities. Life is not perfect, for sure, but we can certainly do better than this. We only have one planet after all. So, how do we do that? What I'm suggesting is that we take a massive step back and completely rewire the global brain. Have a massive shift in global consciousness and decide that we want a new equation, because what we have today isn't really working. So, what's holding us back? If we wanted to make a better world, and I think that we all do, why aren't we getting there? Well, there's this little thing that sometimes scares people â it's called fear. That's what fear does. Well, I say that we actually embrace fear, because fear could be the one thing that we actually need to succeed. We need to be fearless, right? Fear is the direction you want to go in, if you want to become the person you have the potential to be. It's a great compass. So, how do we get there, and what is the thing about fear that we actually fear? It's accountability. And what is accountability? Accountability is something that we look to when we actually want to achieve something. There are two people that I really respect, with great ideas: one of them was Mahatma Gandhi, and the other one was Peter Drucker. Gandhi said, ""Be the change you want to see in the world."" Drucker said, ""What gets measured, gets done."" So, if we can actually have a Gandhi-Drucker mashup, we get something like this: ""Measure the change you want to see in the world."" So, how do we do that? How do we actually measure the quantifiable good that each of us does in life? I call it the Life Force Number. Which is really simple. It's an imperfect measurement, but it basically gives us a way to track how we're doing with the one thing that is the most important part of life: and that is contributing. So, I'm going to tell you about a few people who are really happy people. They're happy, but they are also really successful. They're successful not because of what they make financially, but because of the meaning that they are able to find in life. So, a couple of years ago I went to Senegal, and I met this man. His name is El Hadj Diop. El Hadj is holding a photograph of his daughter, Amy. Amy was 8 years old when she was killed by a horrible, horrible murderer. This murderer actually kills one child every minute. Who's the murderer? A mosquito. So, El Hadj could have been paralyzed by this experience, but it actually propelled him into action. He decided that he wanted something totally different. He stood up in what otherwise would have been a current in the river going downstream, and he said, ""No more."" He basically declared that he would create a malaria-free community. Death-free. So, how did he do that? Well, he studied like hell, he learned how to use different interventions, and he succeeded. He worked really hard at it. He became really happy. He was one man, who helped one village and then an interesting thing happened: more people started to come to him for help. 60 villages came to him for help. That was about 50,000 people. 50,000 people he stopped from dying. That's pretty cool. But what he did is create a model that actually inspired his whole country. So, all of Senegal was learning from this man. So, if you tally this up, his Life Force Number, the positive effect that he's had on the world today from his courage, is over 13 million people. Didn't really cost that much money, but that's pretty successful, if you ask me. Let's go to another story. So, if any of you were sitting around in 2005, you remember Hurricane Katrina. There was a little girl, who like many of us, particularly in the States, was watching television at that time. And we're watching images like this. Right? Hurricane Katrina ripped through New Orleans. It was devastating. But this 10-year-old girl who was sitting in her parents' living room, is not like your ordinary 10-year-old. She wanted to to something, and she did. She got outside, she started visiting her neighbors, knocking on doors, asking for support, to help out. A local newsperson picked it up, got on national TV, and other kids started learning about what she was doing, and they started calling her, saying, ""What can we do?"" ""How can we get involved? We want to be a part of this action."" So, she got pretty busy. Her name was Talia Leman. And Talia started to give back. She started to make a difference to people in New Orleans. Even though that state was miles away from her home. She proved that anyone, even a 10-year-old girl, can make a huge difference. So what is the difference that she made as one girl? With one city. She mobilized 12 million kids to go out and do stuff. They all got really busy together. They raised over $10 million. That's equal to the top five corporate donors of Hurricane Katrina relief. That's pretty awesome. She's now worked over in 4 continents and 20 countries. So, at the most conservative estimate, I put her score, her Life Force Number, at over 25 million. She makes me feel pretty lazy, but, you know... The next story is also kind of interesting. It's an unusual one. It's a geneticist. He wanted to find the cure for a massive human pandemic. Not an easy task. The pandemic that he wanted to treat was hunger. In America it's a pretty big problem. It's a problem worldwide. So, how do you cure hunger? For him it's all about rock & roll. Doesn't seem like the most obvious solution, certainly not something you might find in a laboratory. But, Sid, who's an old friend of mine, loves rock music and he loves going to concerts. So, he started going backstage, and he discovered that backstage there's all this awesome food. The best bands have the best music, and the best music always has the best food. But they also waste that food. Around 10% of food that's in concessions or anything catered ends up in the garbage. Sid thought that was kind of problematic, so he asked Aerosmith if he could have their food one night. He fed 150 people. He went back the next week. He did that for an entire summer. He enlisted over 250 bands, then he went to sports teams, and then he went to universities, and schools, and so on. He started collecting food all over the United States. I met him and he was feeding tens of millions of people. Sorry, not tens of millions! (Laughter) Tens of thousands of people. We decided that what we would do is take his idea to the federal government. And we took five people. We worked on this piece of legislation together. It was about two pages long. We sent that to Congress â it passed. That was called the ""Federal Food Donation Act."" And that bill helped scale what his idea was. Sid, last December, fed his one-billionth meal to someone. His Life Force Number is around 50 million, maybe? But it's probably a lot bigger than that. I'm being really conservative with the estimate. But, one billion meals, one idea â he's kicking ass. My last story is actually about a little boy who, in 1922, was sailing across the ocean to America to find opportunity. He didn't have anything, except the clothes on his back and a small toy horse. So, when he got to the States, he and his mother moved in with this man, who became his stepfather, who wanted him to work in a menial job. So, he said you're done with school, no more school. So, at 14, he ran away from home. A school teacher took him in. And said, ""Come live with me."" This was in the middle of The Great Depression. She gave him clothes, she gave him an education, and she taught him the importance of kindness. What happened to this little boy? Well, interesting thing. He went on to build over 200 successful businesses over the course of his life. Afterwards he became a pretty significant philanthropist, contributing to advancements in sepsis, cancer, diabetes. He funded large institutions of education, like Columbia University, the Library of Congress. He made a big difference. Because of this woman. He also was named the richest man in America in the 1980s. Successful based on the old model, but also the new one. That guy was also my dad. That kid in that little outfit that looks ridiculous is me. And my mom. So, at the end of my dad's life, I asked him a question. I said, ""Who of all the people you've met in your long life has been the most successful?"" He looked at me, thought for a minute, he said, ""Mrs. Durat."" So, who's Mrs. Durat? She is a schoolteacher that took in a schoolboy, who was a runaway, and spent his life working, so that he could give back, for her. So, the person that made the difference here, is not actually my dad, but it's Mrs. Durat. She is the true billionaire here. Contribution clearly reaps rewards for people. And, with all contribution, you know, getting to a billion, it takes a lot of work and teamwork and courage, but it always starts with one. One idea, one person. But anyone can do it. Through the power of connectivity and the power of ideas, we're able to scale like crazy. Just like these other four people. So, I think that the world needs heroes today, with the size of the problems that we're facing. I would like to invite you to help me create a different equation in life. And, maybe some of us would get to become billionaires, like Mrs. Durat. Thank you.   "
Herramientas para la toma de decisiones,Pablo Montilla,"Good morning, how are you all? I see you are calm. I will try to share some tools that, as Marita said, I have been with my company of enological products for almost 20 years. It has allowed me to develop professionally. Today, it is the company that allows us all to live, beyond the fact that we have also ventured into other alternative businesses during this time. All those alternative businesses, generally, I don't remember any that turned out well. The truth is that these things one tries to do sometimes end in some failures, some losses, and some bad moments. But I like to start this way because if not, one always talks only about the good parts of the story. And if there's something we've all experienced, it's that we learn much more from failures and mistakes than from the things that go well. The truth is that it has to do with everything. As many of the previous speakers have said, we should not be afraid of failures. They are just another part of life, another part of work.  Well, basically, I want to share some small tools that have helped me both at work and in some parts of life as well. We try to organize and generate some organizational tools, which we will be discussing. But above all, I want to share that I had the opportunity, or rather the intention, because I had the opportunity, but I had the intention to study at the university. I graduated as an enologist at an agricultural college, which functioned in this great building. And when one leaves these traditional tools, those that we all know like primary school, secondary school, university, master's degree, languages, we sometimes realize that they are not enough. When we enter the labor field, we see that all these tools are very good, very positive, but they are not enough. So, my idea is to share some tools that I found more practical and that can help us, tools that can help us to develop a business, a life, many things that we will be discussing, and that will help us.  As we said, all these tools are very good, but we see that they are not enough. So, to organize this, I want to make a small analogy of work, or life in general, with a journey. What does this have to do with? Well, we all have to be clear about many things, whether the journey is short or long, it doesn't matter. We have to know where we are starting from, what tools we have for the journey, and we need to have a goal, where we want to go.  Many things may seem obvious, and some speakers have already mentioned them, but you will see that these obvious things are not always put into practice when it's time to act. For example, we need to know where we are, where we want to go, and how we plan for it. For instance, how do we plan for Monday, how do we start Monday, do we have it programmed, analyzed, and know what we will do? This extends into the week, the month, the year, our personal goals, our work goals. So, I insist a lot on making the first analysis, knowing exactly our starting point.  From there, obviously, the tools we need for the journey will emerge. The tools we need to develop ourselves. While all these traditional tools are good, suddenly, we can find many other tools in life that will help us progress. One of the main tools is observing. Observe what? Observe the people around you, to copy what they are doing well, to take what you like from them and improve it, adapt it to yourself. These are all small things that will make us better and make things simpler and better.  The truth is that if you look around, you will find a lot of people, from parents, friends, colleagues, all of them have something positive. Absolutely always, you can learn something from them. So, it is very important to be an observer, not just to see, but to observe, to copy and take the positive aspects.  Also, it's important to realize that we can't surround ourselves with just anyone. It may seem obvious, but the truth is, it's crucial to get closer to people who bring something positive, who help us grow, who complement us, and distance ourselves from those who are negative, who don't help, who don't contribute. Make a small analysis of the people around you, and you will see that by thinking positively, there are many things you can learn and that you haven't even noticed yet.  Another typical thing, especially as one starts to develop and grow, is losing priorities. It's fundamental to set priorities. We all know examples, the typical one who starts to do well and the first thing they do is buy a better car, instead of capitalizing on their work. It's important to have clear priorities and not lose them as we progress. As the situation improves, we must capitalize on our achievements and not rush into things.  Another important thing is setting rules. We all know we live in a country with many rules or, at least, many illogical rules. But, no one forces us to be stuck in that situation. We can set our personal rules. For example, as the owner of my company, I never do what I want. I don't do what's best for me, I do what's best for everyone. This is a way of setting rules in the personal sphere.  In the business sphere, we have certifications. For several years, we have had ISO certifications for commercialization, and they help us stay organized and maintain a work line. In a country that sometimes doesn't help in this sense, instead of lamenting, we can generate our own rules.  Talking about travel, there are many young people here. I had the opportunity to play rugby, and I got the chance to play in Australia for a year, and in Italy for two years. Traveling is not easy today, but there are endless opportunities, and it's worth trying. Traveling generates personal growth and life experience that you can't learn elsewhere. It's a great way to learn languages and cultures. If you get the chance, choose wisely, direct your efforts to places where you can gain the most, like learning a new language.  Finally, having clear goals and dreams is essential. It's crucial to have a great dream that motivates you. No matter how big or small, being convinced and determined will give you the strength to reach your goals. With determination, you can achieve whatever you want.  That's all, thank you."
I had an abortion... Or maybe I didn't,Leslie Cannold,I had an  abortion or maybe I  didn't why does it  matter abortion shame is very zist at  the moment or more precisely and far  more happily anti- shame is very  uist in the New York Times in a number  of online magazines and on websites like  1 in three 45 million voices and exhale  women are speaking out they're resisting  The Shame by breaking their Silence  about their  abortions but the success of this  fledgling speakout movement is far from  guaranteed indeed if we want it to  succeed we are going to have to  help but before I can tell you what it  is that you can do to stand up for women  I really need to take you on a bit of a  360 around  shame I need to talk to you about what  it is how it works and what it does to  its  victims so I thought what I would ask  you to do is just actually stop looking  at me for a minute and have a look  around you so look at your neighbors  smile at them wear TED it's  cool and now Focus bit on the women so  just meet the eyes of the women and  smile while I tell you that one in three  of those women will have an abortion in  her  lifetime now that would be true if this  was an Australian audience or a British  audience or an American audience one in  three women will have an abortion in  their lifetime and if you haven't yet  you can stop looking at each other  now now there are a lot of ways that I  could have made that point I could have  thrown something like this up on the  screen and I could have said one in  three Australian American and British  women will have an abortion in their  lifetime I could have said according to  the World Health Organization abortion  medical or surgical is one of the safest  and most common medical  procedures but it's not the same is  it what if I had said okay have a look  around at everybody in the audience  focusing on the women while I tell you  that but every single one of those women  in the next five years is going to blow  her  nose not the  same that is  shame we actually aren't born feeling  ashamed of anything we're not ashamed of  our nakedness we're not ashamed of our  bodily functions or our sexual desires  or reproduction or  abortion we learn from our communities  what is  shameful and it is the real or perceived  oversight of those communities that make  us feel  shame now shame is about fear but what  are we afraid of this is bne brown she  gave a fantastic Ted Talk which I really  commend to you about shame and when I  saw it I went screwing off to find her  academic work and what I discovered was  that according to Brown what shame is is  the acutely anxiety educing experience  that we are  flawed and that others are going to find  out that we are flawed in comparison to  other people and other people are going  to find that out and when they  do they're going to demean us or  ridicule us or judge us and cast us  out so I've used that word cast out for  a reason reason and the reason is that  I'm trying to underscore the fact that  the  consequences that people fear the fear  that shame that evokes in people the  consequences they fear of being shamed  are very very real they're very very  significant so in ancient times if a  woman brought shame on her name or her  family or her community she could  literally be thrown out of that  Community cast out  she could be  stoned in some places in the world today  that is still the  case in our world a woman might be  afraid if people find out that she's had  an abortion that her Church community  will evict her or she might be worried  that her family or her boyfriend or her  husband might throw her out of the house  or that her friends will start a whisper  campaign about  her but the thing is that those fears  all cut is something very very essential  about us very very Primal and indeed  that is why shame is such an ancient  form of social control because it  actually goes to something that may be  hardwired in us which is this desire to  stay in connection with other human  beings  shame evokes the fear of  disconnection I had an  abortion or maybe I  didn't why do you  care that's the shame cycle shame equals  silence equals  ignorance but before I can tell you and  will tell you about that silence and  that ignorance and how it hurts women I  want to tell you one thing that shame  doesn't  do shame does not stop women  having  abortions now the data on this is not  great and I'm a researcher so I care  about this kind of stuff and it's not  great because it's difficult data to get  and because abortion is stigmatized and  so the research funding isn't there but  from what we can  tell shame does not stop many if any  women from having  abortions but that doesn't mean it  doesn't hurt women it does and it hurts  them by some B in them and by causing  ignorance so let's talk about  that Silent Women can't ask for  support 2third of women fear that if  others find out about their  abortion they will look down on them and  so nearly that number 58 to  60% don't tell their friends and their  family about their abortion and talk  about their abortion little or not at  all Silent Women can't share  information so if I reach out to someone  and say oh my god I've got I've pregnant  when I don't want to be I don't know  what to do and someone says to me oh you  know that's terrible like that happened  to me too and here's how I felt and  here's how it went and I went to this  clinic and it was terrific or I went to  that one and it wasn't so good but  whatever you do if you go to this one be  really careful because across the street  there's a building that's dled up to  look like the abortion clinic but it's  actually not an abortion clinic at all  it's run by a pro-life agency and by the  time you even work out where you are  they will have told you a whole bunch of  false information about abortion they  may have told you you're going to hell  and by the time you stumble out of there  you'll have missed your appointment  Silent  Women don't ask for the laws they need  and  deserve and indeed this was actually how  I came into the shame issue because I am  an abortion rights activist and in order  to change the laws to try to get things  out of the law that hurt women to try to  put things into the law that protect  women I actually need to raise awareness  amongst decision makers and amongst the  public that there is a problem so if you  think about any news item that you've  ever seen or a newspaper article about  some broad social issue you'll see that  it starts with a story it starts with a  story of a particular person and that's  so that it doesn't seem so abstract and  you can actually see that this broad  social issue that's being spoken about  is actually hurting someone and that's  why it is we need to make the effort to  change  things but if I can't get women to tell  their stories I can't get things in the  media  or if I do get them in the media I get  them buried at the back of the News  Bulletin or the back of the paper where  they have less  influence I couldn't even get women to  come to camera and talk to  politicians and that means it's really  hard for me to make some of the changes  that I want to  make so you've got to ask yourself if  shame is so bad for women then why is it  still happening and who is doing it  well the answer to who's doing it is the  Sham  stokers and the reason is that shame is  a gift that just keeps on  giving shame equals silence equals  ignorance equals shame equals silence  equals more ignorance equals more shame  and more silence and more  ignorance and that silence and that  ignorance is the  fertilizer for the ground on which  repressive abortion laws and policies  flourish so I want to give you a bit of  a feel for what sham stoking looks and  sounds like because the weird thing is  that women who've had abortions can hear  it and it is around us all the time but  people who aren't tuned into it can't  hear it so it's really important that  you see it you hear it and you recognize  when it's B out okay so here's some  examples and I should say to you that I  could have picked from thousands so this  is really just a tasting  plate a legacy of unutterable  shame that was said by an Australian  Health Minister who said that  Australia's abortion rate was a national  tragedy that left a legacy of  unutterable  Shame vaginally penetrated when they got  pregnant this was said very recently by  an American legislator who was one of a  number who is trying to change laws and  indeed some of these laws have been  successfully implemented that require a  woman who is seeking abortion to have an  ultrasound but you see most women who  have abortions have been very early on  in pregnancy which means that kind of  usual ultrasound doesn't work you can't  see anything it's all just too small so  instead they mandate that a probe be  inserted inside that woman  this is a non-medically indicated  transvaginal  ultrasound the woman's doctor is forced  to give it to her even though there's no  medical reason for it and she may have  denied  consent and when it was pointed out to  this legislator that in any other  context you would call that  rape he essentially said well we don't  really have to worry about those sort of  women because after all they were  vaginally penetrated when they got  pregnant and our final shame stoking is  abortion is a worse moral Scandal than  priests sexually abusing young  people this was said by a Catholic  Archbishop again not long ago to a group  of young  people and I just want to stop for a  minute on this one and just underscore  what is really being said here so what  is being said is the moral evil that we  need to concern ourselves about is not  men in positions of authority and Trust  who rape children and or then cover it  up the real moral problem of our time is  women who have  abortions so there's a couple of  messages that the Sham stokers are  sending us there one message  is direct to women who've had  abortions so what they're worried about  is if they talk about their abortion  they'll be shamed and judged and cast  out and the Sham stokers are saying to  them You Bet Your Life you  will you put your head above the parit  Missy and we will kick you in the  teeth and the second message the Sham  stokers are sending is to all of us and  it's really really a lesson worth  learning and it is  this that if you don't tell your own  story other people will tell that story  for  you silence does not stay silent for  long so this is an optimistic challenge  right and I've just dragged you right  down into the mud but do not worry  because we are heading up and the reason  we are heading up is because there is  Absolut absolutely nothing that I have  just told you that you cannot do  something  about you bet you  bet communities cause shame and  communities can stop it so let's talk  about what you can  do Reach  Out women who've had abortions who feel  supported experience less shame and less  of Shame noxious Downstream consequences  so let the women in your world know that  you are not a sham  stoker that if they talk to you about a  problem pregnancy or an abortion you  will not judge them you will not shame  them but you will listen with empathy  and compassion and let them know they're  not  alone you can  dance at the end of this month in  Melbourne  women and men are going to get out into  the street wearing t-shirts like that  and they're going to say exactly that we  are not sham stokers they are going to  say to women we want to stand up for you  and against abortion shame and we are  hoping um reproductive Choice Australia  is hoping because we're organizing this  event we're desperately hoping it's  going to catch on like wildfire we want  it to go right around the globe we want  communities everywhere to pick this sort  of positive uplifting message to send  out to the women in their community that  says the time for shame is  over and if you can't get to one of  those flash mobs and or if you do go and  you want to do something else you can  actually take precisely that pledge  online you can pledge that you will not  engage an abortion shaming and you will  not tolerate it when others do so so  please keep an eye out for that  opportunity  so if you do all that what do you  get so instead of this negative downward  cycle of Shame equals silence equals  ignorance which causes more shame and  more silence and more  ignorance you get an upward spiral you  get empathy equals connection equals  empowerment equals empathy equals  connection equals empowerment for women  so some of you may have seen this I'll  just give you like a quick chance to  just run your eyes over  it I in no way mean to disrespect the  person who said this okay he said he was  one of the first people to speak out  against the Nazis and he deserves heaps  of respect but I've put it up there  because the truth is that I don't really  like it and I don't really like it  because even though it's true even  though it is true that one of the  reasons we act morally is because we're  worried that if we don't stand up for  people women who have abortions say that  women who have abortions won't stand up  for us that is  true but I'm looking for something  morally much bigger than  that I'm looking for something more Lady  Diana who in the midst of the AIDS  crisis when people were seeking to shun  and stigmatize and judge and cast out  anybody who was thought to have the  virus and gay men she started reaching  out her hand to touch those people and  to shake their hands I'm looking for  something more like the king of Denmark  who the apocryphal Story Goes when the  Nazis came into Denmark and said you  have to Brand all your Jews with a  star he said well fine but if that's  going to happen I'm going to wear a star  too and so so is every  D I'm looking for people who want to say  not by my hand not on my watch because I  am the strong one and standing up for  women and against abortion shame it is  just the right thing to  do  so I had an  abortion or maybe I  didn't but I hope by now you know that  it doesn't matter either  way because we won't be silent  anymore thank you
Innovative thinking - Can you be taught?,Roberta B. Ness,"Let me ask you a question about the ability to innovate. Can you be taught? How many of you think that creativity is innate - you have it or you don't? Show of hands. How many of you think that with instruction you can become a really fine innovator? Woah. Great. Well, it turns out you're both right. To some degree, you're born with the characteristics that make you a better, or not so good, innovator. On the other hand, 30 years of research has shown us that well designed creativity-training programs can, in fact, improve your innovative thinking skills, and today I'm going to tell you how. I'm the dean of the University of Texas School of Public Health, and I'm a scientist. And I can promise you that I never took a class in innovative thinking, because classes like that barely exist within science curricula. But about 10 years ago, my boss called me into the office, and he said, ""Roberta, you're doing a great job. You know, getting lots of grants, publishing lots of papers. But I wonder if you're actually moving the needle. I wonder if you're taking the risks to leap your science forward. And my reaction to that was - well, I was pissed. (Laughter) My second reaction was that I was afraid because, essentially, he was asking me to move from a place where I was successful to a place that I could be putting out crazy ideas that would get me laughed out of my profession. Nonetheless, I started into what I call ""my summer projects,"" the last of which was writing a book about what we're talking about today. But mostly these were science papers, and they took a question and kind of looked at it from the side. And they tried to get science to just move in a slightly different direction. Some of those were pretty successful - I'll tell you about one of those later. But the point is that I learned that I had the innate ability to innovate, but I had been too afraid to use it, and I wonder if to some degree that may be true for you. Last year, Newsweek published this cover story, and when you turned inside, you saw an article entitled ""The Creativity Crisis."" It reported that school-age children in America for the last 20 years have been gaining points on IQ tests, but they've been losing points on standardized tests of creativity. So our children are getting less creative. About the same time, the National Academies of Science published a report which suggested that the same thing may be happening in American science, that we're actually losing our edge on innovation. Now, at this point, you should stop me, and you should say, ""What? Are you crazy? Come on. Look around you. Technology is rocketing forward."" But my response would be, ""If you look at the major threats to mankind - global warming, the obesity epidemic, Alzheimer's disease, cancer - science is making slow and unsteady progress, and I worry that that is for lack of imagination."" Now, while this is going on, our desire for innovation has never been greater. Google the word, and you will get 250 million hits. And if you ask CEOs of major American companies what's the primary characteristic they're looking for in their work force, guess what it is. Innovation, right. So, we have a demand-and-supply problem. What are we going to do? Well, I'm going to give you a little peek into a course that I teach on innovative thinking. The main concept in this course is something called ""frames."" Frames define our thinking. They are the set of expectations that we use to interpret new information. Let me give you an example. So, you go to a restaurant, and the waitress brings you a plate of steaming linguine and says, ""Is there anything more I can get you?"" And you ask for the Parmesan cheese, and she smiles and nods and says, ""Go to the kitchen and get it yourself."" (Laughter) That's a frame break, okay? It's not what you were expecting. It demonstrates two really important characteristics of frames. One, they are ubiquitous. So within any social setting, usually you're working within a frame. For instance, here in the auditorium today, you have certain expectations about what others are going to do. So if the person sitting next to you were to sneeze and then grab your sleeve and wipe their nose on it ... (Laughter) Okay, it would be a little strange. You'd be surprised. That brings us to the second characteristic of frames, which is that they are not just cognitive, but they are emotional. And so when someone breaks your frame, you have a powerful and visceral rejection reaction. But to innovate, we must break frames. So doing that, even though you might want to, is, really, not an easy thing to do, and it takes practice. Now, speaking of practice, of course, every good class, like this, has a test. It's time for our test. I'd like you to please close your books and take out a piece of paper and pencil. No, just kidding. But I would like to see if you can solve this mystery. (Video) Gary and Nancy are lying dead on the floor. Around them is a puddle of water and some shards of broken glass. What were the circumstances of their death? So how many of you are thinking CSI - right? You got this one down. Well, what if I told you that the easiest way to solve the mystery is that Gary and Nancy are fish; his fishbowl broke. Okay? So you may not have jumped to that conclusion, and the reason that you didn't is because names imply humanity. So, actually, to find that solution, you had to break a frame. So it turns out that frame-breaking is not an easy thing to do. So I'm going to help you out today, and I'm going to give you a few tools. The first tool is observation. To be a great innovator, you must be a great observer. I want you to close your eyes for a second and see if you can imagine the face of your cellphone. I want you to think about where every number and every letter goes or where every app goes. Okay. Now open your eyes. Did it look something like this? Well, it turns out that this is a really hard thing to do. Despite the fact that you look at your cellphone dozens of times a day, almost no one can get this exactly correct. Why is that? Well, we are confronted with so much sensory information; it's so overwhelming that we really can't process it all, and so we have to process it through a filter. And that's our frames. We don't expect it and we don't see it. Which brings us to the story of Warren and Marshall and the 2005 Nobel Prize for their discovery of the link between H pylori and stomach ulcers. Now, Warren was a pathologist, and he was looking at these biopsy slides from patients with peptic ulcers, and he noticed these funny little dots. He tried to make them go away, but he couldn't. So he hooked up with a newly-minted gastroenterologist named Marshall, and between the two of them, they decided that these were bacteria. Now, that was such a revolutionary idea that they were ostracized by the scientific profession. And in order to prove it, Marshall actually drank a Petri dish full of H pylori and caused himself to get a stomach ulcer. Well, fortunately, H pylori is easily treated with antibiotics, and this was a major breakthrough for medicine. But here's the point for us today: Warren actually saw these little bugs without any special microscope and without any special stains. Why was he the only one that saw it even though it was right in front of everyone's eyes? And the answer is because the frame at the time said that bacteria couldn't be there, that they could not grow in the acidic environment of the stomach. A second tool is reversal. Darwin is famous for his theory of evolution by means of natural selection. The frame at the time was creationism. It said God creates every creature to perfection. Darwin flipped that. He said I believe Mother Nature couldn't give a hoot about the random mutations that she throws into the environment to compete for survival. Darwin also used another tool, which was change your point of view. He wondered, How is it that one characteristic is able to compete against another and become more common in the population? And to answer that, he had to figure out, How do organisms adapt to their environment? And so to do that, he imagined himself as a plant - this is actually a true story - he imagined himself as a plant. A third tool is analogies. Modern-day science analogies have brought us the design for new semiconductor chips on the basis of the child's toy Etch A Sketch and the design for new shipping patterns on the basis of the swarming behavior of ants. In the classroom, we use exercises to try to hone our analogy-making skills, such as, How is a marriage like a matchbox? Here's what my students said: (Video) They spark. They strike each other - not that we want ... Roberta Ness: How is a dream like a dryer? (Video) Forget about it - it can shrink or get ruined. RN: How is history like a mango? (Video) Both can be altered to suit your purpose. (Laughter) The students are always better than me, right? So, I promised I was going to tell you a story about one of my summer projects, and I wanted to wait until I had given you some of the tools so that you can see if you can find the tools embedded in this story. So, I was asked to look at the problem of ovarian cancer, and as you may know, that's a terrible disease. In fact, I became involved in a walk to raise money for research on ovarian cancer, and of the 10 women who, as friends, started out walking together in the first year, by the fifth year, only two of them were left. So I realized that science, medicine has made very little progress on improving the life expectancy of these women. And what I really wanted to do was to make sure that no one ever gets ovarian cancer in the first place. And so to do that, I had to figure out what the cause is. So, it occurred to me that the cells that line the ovary are the same cells that line our airways. And just like smoking causes inflammation, which triggers mutagenesis and, thereby, lung cancer, I wondered if the same thing might happen in the ovary. Well, since then we've actually been able to find some inflammants that may trigger ovary cancer, and we've been able to find ways to prevent those. Moreover, colleagues from around the world have actually come up with the idea of potentially vaccinating against ovary cancer in order to prevent it, just like you would prevent an inflammatory, infectious disease. So when you leave here today, there are two things you can immediately do to improve your innovation thinking skills. First, when you're confronted with a new idea that brings you up short, you can think, hmm, What was the frame when I was reacting that way? Is there alternative frame I could be using? And when you're working on a thorny problem, you can try flipping it. You can try changing your point of view. And the second thing you can do is simply to be more open to new ideas. When you were a little kid, you may have taken out your coloring book, and you may have scribbled the grass purple and the girl's hair or the boy's hair orange. I encourage you and your children to discover your innovation muse, to find the joy in coloring outside the lines. Thank you."
You Only Are Disabled in an Environment that Makes You That Way,Gordon Hartman,"good morning let me tell you I am  extremely excited to be here this  morning I get the opportunity to stand  before all of you and to tell you about  the inspiration in my life Morgan and to  tell you how she has played such a major  role in my life in the lives of so many  people who have special needs now before  I get into all the details of that I  want to back up a little bit and tell  you how I got to this point as was  mentioned I was in the home building  business land development business  started when I was 19 and really loved  the business and had an opportunity for  21 years to really get the business to  run exactly like I wanted it to I had an  opportunity to get into the mortgage  business title business all sorts of  different businesses and then 2005 came  and a company out of California said we  won't put you in retirement and if you  remember back then business was really  booming things were wild and crazy and  the economy and so I said okay so I sold  the companies and then I went from the  day of running numerous companies to the  point of then going okay what am I going  to do in the second half of my life so  many opportunities came to me I had an  opportunity to get into different  businesses reinvest in big ways and do  some neat stuff but I also had the  opportunity to take my daughter to  school something I never had a chance to  do I was able to go to Morgan's birthday  parties and get to know her friends and  talk to them and talk to parents he said  let me tell you a little bit about  Morgan Morgan just turned 18 years old  but Morgan has special needs  Morgan has a tough time adding two plus  two she can get there but you got to  work at it with her Morgan has a tough  time reading a simple sentence  she'll get there but it's tough and  she'll get frustrated she'll get upset  at herself and wish she was someone else  Morgan is someone who has 26 screws in  her back and two rods and two hangers to  allow her to stand up straight let me  tell you what Morgan has it's more  important than anything she has an  attitude that is absolutely incredible  every night when we put her to bed she  has a smile on her face every morning  she has a smile on her face she has gone  through all these different obstacles  and things but always keeps an attitude  that is incredibly strong and so through  that inspiration and the opportunity to  talk and see more and understand more  about the special needs community  instead of all the opportunities that  may exist from a business perspective I  decided maybe the second half of my life  she'd be dedicated towards something  else and that was all because of the  inspiration and the attitude of this  wonderful young lady now what does that  mean  well what I thought I had should do is  build a foundation or form a foundation  which I did and we do numerous things  but one of the things that we wanted to  do is we wanted to go out and build  something or things as we were building  the foundation that would be here for a  long term would that be building medical  facilities or different things in the  community such as schools etc that would  be here long lasting to help the special  needs community but then something  happened about five years ago that  really caused what I'm here to talk  about today and that is Morgan's  Wonderland you see we were on a family  trip and Morgan loves to go swimming she  doesn't really know how to swim like a  and she's not real good at it but she  loves to flap around in the water and do  what kids do we went down to the pool at  the hotel and it was late and day it was  a smaller hotel a smaller pool and there  were three kids at the other end of the  pool and there were two of them were  throwing a ball back and forth and  Morgan and I were to pull I got out and  Morgan I saw was slowly inching her way  over and she wanted to play with those  kids she couldn't tell him that  she didn't know how to really bring  about that interaction so what happened  is is Morgan started moving closer and  closer she eventually hit the ball she  got that close and the kids were looking  at her like what are you doing  Morgan just wanted to play what happened  at that point is where this all happened  those nice kids grabbed the ball and  they all got out of the pool they got  out of the pool because they didn't know  what it would be like to really explore  the habit of the joy and the happiness  of playing was someone who maybe  couldn't verbally say exactly what she  wanted but she would just like them in  so many ways but because they didn't  understand that the interaction of play  did not occur as Morgan turned around I  saw her face and I thought to myself oh  my god she just looked at me like I  don't get it she didn't say anything she  went back I jumped in the pool we played  i sat there and we did we continued on  for a couple weeks I after that vacation  I kept thinking about that Turner  Morgan's head to me and the look that  she had and I have to tell you kept  thinking about it thinking about it I  said there's got to be a place that I  can we can take Morgan to where  everybody understands what's going on  there in the element of play and there  will be interaction between those who  have special needs and those who don't  have special needs I didn't know what  that meant so I thought well I'll call  some people I'll go around look at  different parks in the country just to  see if there's something outside that we  could replicate or take Morgan to or do  something so somehow bring that barrier  down to where the next time there are  kids in that pool they'll go hey come on  over they'll understand and that play  will occur so I went around the country  looking at a different place --is that  at least we're told that may be in line  and nothing was closed what I found if  anything had anything to tie with  special needs that a lot of times it was  off the beaten path it wasn't in the  middle of everything else it was all  kind of by itself and I said to myself  let's do one of these in San Antonio  what is this I don't know what I'm going  to do I'm just going to do it so I  invited a bunch of people to a meeting  to talk about the idea of building this  part but and I just had a sheet of paper  behind me that was basically white and I  said I got this idea  tell you what happened and we can do  better nine invited doctors and  therapists and teachers and people who  have special needs and we all spent  hours and hours and hundreds of people  showed up I thought this is kind of cool  because we don't really know what we're  even gonna be talking about doli and  they all showed up and we went over and  we went over and over and talked about  if we built this park with the theory of  and the idea of trying to bring down  that barrier what would be in it well  what I heard was numerous things eight  and a half pages of single tight ideas  then I said okay what I want to do is I  want to get outside the box I want to  hire people to do this who have never  done a part before I want to hire an  architect who's never done a part before  I wanted to hire an engineer who's never  done a part before I want to hire  graphics people have never done a part  before because I'm gonna be told by them  how you're supposed to build a park and  we're gonna be different this time so  all these people who in did everything  from Morgan's Wonderland had never done  it before that was the cool part what  they had those some real grassroots  ideas presented by people in the middle  of it all the people who really work  with special needs individuals on a  daily basis and understand it and those  who has special needs themselves what I  heard more than anything was give us a  place that is safe you see if I have a  child who's autistic to go to the park  is tough because you never know when  that child might take a run wouldn't we  need to go to a park and know that  somehow if that child did run that you  could kind of relax for a little bit so  when you go to Morgan's Wonderland  everybody gets an RFID tag so we know  exactly where they are at all times in  the parking you can find them through  any of the video screens that exist  throughout the park the reason that  exists is so that you can sit in if  Johnny runs off it's okay you can go  find them you know exactly where he is  and you'll know everybody in your party  within three seconds we brought that  kind of technology and we also said not  only do we want a safe place but we want  a good environment we want an  environment that's a little different  does that mean well think about it if  you're in a wheelchair and you go to  these wonderful places do great job from  an 88 perspective gives new world in all  these places but the crowds  and the time it might take to do  something and impatience of people  because they aren't sometimes old at  Morgan's women let's build a place that  maybe could hold 4,500 or 5,000 people  but let's not ever have more than about  1,500 or 2,000 in there this build it  bigger so that the environment is one to  where if you want to get on to a  carousel and it takes longer because our  carousel allows no matter what your  physical or mental special need may be  that we will allow you an opportunity to  get on that carousel and if it takes ten  minutes see if the culture of Morgan's  Wonderland it's okay we'll help you and  get you on that carousel and everybody  is patient because that's what Morgan's  Wonderland is about there is no other  carousel like the one at Morgan's  Wonderland there is no other off-road  adventure ride like the one at Morgan's  Wonderland there is no other Train like  the one that is at Morgan's Wonderland  these aren't big magical ideas what we  did basically at Morgan's Wonderland I'm  so proud of the people who had never  done this before but they said this look  we are going to design a park for  special needs but we're going to build  it for everyone because when you walk  into Morgan's Wonderland it looks like  any other park you don't see ramps and  all that kind of stuff it's a place  where you walk in and go I can play here  know whether I have a special need or  not but those who do have special needs  they can do everything we take the most  fragile children and adults those who  are on ventilators those who sometimes  unfortunately just have three days to  live who say then the family says can  they come over there and have an  opportunity we had a child come to  Morgan's Wonderland that was three days  before he died he had an opportunity he  smiled he had that because he was able  to do what he wanted to do and the  family knew what he wanted to do and he  couldn't have done it anywhere else in  the world except that this unique part  now as I talked earlier when I got to  know Morgan's friends and families and  stuff what I found out his morning was  really one of the lucky ones you see  Morgan has what she needs she has a  physical therapist and the doctors and  the and all that because I've been  blessed to be able to give  that to her but see I noticed that many  times those with special needs don't  have always all those economic  opportunities to give their child are  those who they care for what they really  need so we made it early on and  commitment that anyone who comes to  Morgan's Wonderland always comes for  free always comes for free it doesn't  matter we don't look it up in a book and  define what special needs is if you say  you have a special needs when you  especially need when you come to the  front you get in for free we figure if  you lie about it you have a special need  and so it's it's it's it's our approach  saying we are here because we're gonna  give you a break and we're gonna allow  it the opportunity that if you want to  come to this park thirty times a year  you come to the park 30 times a year and  you can ride to Train seven times if you  want to and we have some children who  just stay on the train the whole time  that's what they want that's that  consistency is what they like at another  place could they do that no no now  through this entire process it's been  amazing to see what has occurred I have  to tell you a story about Morgan it kind  of gives you a sense of what a place  like this does I know what people he's  asked me what does Morgan like to do  when she goes to the park well at first  all she would do is go on the swings we  have 35 swings five different kinds  whether you're in a wheelchair whatever  your physical or mental special need  maybe you can swing at Morgan's Wornall  Morgan we just go on the swings I see  Morgan let's go on the carousel no  shooing too close to it just scared of  it all right let's go no let's go stand  next to the carousel okay finally she  did that then Morgan after a while  eventually said I said Morgan let's just  go and sit on an animal no okay finally  she did that then we got her on an  elephant couldn't can go just will sit  on and then Morgan and then getting her  off the elevator was in ur thumb will go  under  but then the next time we went Morgan  said we wanted to go to the carousel and  when she went to the carousel now she'd  get on it and she would go one time real  slow  remember everybody else is in the park  and enjoying the park with her at this  point no pressure  there's no pressure it's just simply but  here's the neat thing Morgan now when  she goes to the park goes to the  carousel first and rides it on her own  okay well why is that a big deal  well Morgan now when she finishes the  first time she looked at me said are you  proud of me Dad yeah and that's what  happens at Morgan's Wonderland you take  a child who it seems like a small thing  to write on a caer so that's a big deal  little things are big things and at  Morgan's Wonderland through Play they  learn they learn that they have the  opportunity to achieve something just as  even if it's a small thing just riding a  carousel Morgan doesn't want me near the  carousel when she rides now because she  doesn't independently and it's taught  her something and on the 26 different  attractions that fit in this thirty-five  million dollar park ultra accessible  park it gives opportunities to thousands  tens of thousands and I'm happy to say  over two hundred thousand people in such  a short period have already been through  the park  not just from here matter of fact one  out of two people who come to spark  going come from this area they come from  outside here they come from outside this  the state they come from outside this  country thirty four different countries  have been represented at Morgan's  Wonderland already and here's the neat  thing we don't have a marketing budget  it's all done by word of mouth because  those who have special needs and those  who are caregivers and those who are  involved in this whole thing are really  tight-knit people and they're starving  for something like this I didn't know  that at first I knew they were but I did  after I had that first meeting where my  said yeah there's something here but  what was the neatest thing about that  meeting is once that happened and  started is that how this community and  the community even outside the city all  joined together you see we just started  this idea in 2007 when we actually  started thinking let's talk about this  we finished it thirty nine months later  we raised almost all the money we're  about five six million dollars  short of raising all the 435 million  dollars but we did it because of  passionate people who came together  quickly and said the time has been too  long for something like this remember  five and a half percent of population  requires assistance every day or they  cannot make it through there there's  fifteen percent of the population is  special-needs we're not talking from a  million people we're talking 50 million  people in this country who are special  need it's a big big number and we're  just scratching your surface since we  don't have a marketing budget it's word  of mouth but we are seeing people come  from all over and finding always make a  wish we are one the top locations for  make-a-wish people come here because  this is a place they can go anywhere but  Morgan's Wonderland is special it is a  special place for our special friends  and for all those it's not just about  the special needs in the video though  it's about everybody being able to play  together three out of four people who  come to Moore is where I don't have a  special need  you see they join in with those who have  especially and it brings down that  barrier that happened in that pool  because then that child who is 21 years  old who has the mental capacity of a  five year old who's playing in that sand  Circle feels very comfortable and he's  got eight year olds and twelve year olds  playing right around him and that brings  down that barrier and that allows him  who could go nowhere else and playing a  fan circle the opportunity to do that  but do it in an environment that he  loves a place that he feels safe his  family feels comfortable and everybody  is working in conjunction for the  element of inclusion that's Morgan's  Wonderland that's Morgan's one life now  when you let people a lot of them in for  free and you put on a lot of free things  you don't you're not going to make money  that's what Morgan's Wonderland is not  about it's not about selling tickets  it's about offering a service now how  did you do that well I wanted to put  something together working with a lot of  wonderful people that would would do two  things one being economics and one being  about explaining that whole element of  inclusion and that is next to Morgan's  Wonderland is a seventy-five acres  Soccer Park so people always ask me I  don't get it Gordon soccer especially I  don't get it  soccer plays a big role  why soccer well on what in our thoughts  and my feeling about all this is that we  need to bring something to San Antonio  and there's a sport in San Antonio that  I didn't feel was really being properly  dealt with from the standpoint of giving  quality facilities to and that was  soccer so why don't we take something  help the overall community tie it next  door to a special needs a part that is  for those with special needs in the  entire community so when thousands of  people come and play soccer on these  four of 14 different fields they will  get that and ask the question what is it  and then it will bring awareness you  think it brings awareness so you do  something good with your community you  bring awareness but then you do another  thing we rent those fields into renting  these top-quality fields we bring money  over to Morgan's Wonderland to help with  the operations of it it's incredible you  can go there and see 7,000 people on a  weekend play soccer on these fields when  these big tournaments go and these  tournaments don't just come from San  Antonio this region they come from  around the state and around the country  but when they come here they learn they  learn and it brings the exposure up of  those who have special needs in the idea  of inclusion so let's take it one step  further  last year we bought a pro soccer team  and we're bringing it to San Antonio  they'll start play they'll start playing  in six months across the street from  Morgan's woodland but then there's going  to be a community stadium built right  across the street from Morgan's water  line and so through that through the  Scorpions through all the different  events that occur in this community  stadium that is being built all with  private funds what will ultimately  happen is we will bring hundreds of  thousands of people and through the most  popular sport in the world  every time that team travels around  North America competing it will be able  to talk about soccer but it will also be  able to talk about Morgan's Wonderland  what is Moreland it's a place of  inclusion we all bring people together  so it plays a revenue source because  money from that will ultimately go to  Morgan's winner oil 100% but it will  also bring awareness to what it's all  about so Morgan's Wonderland is not just  the sticks and bricks to me it's about a  movement it's about an approach of being  able to do something different it's  about the idea of saying the time is now  to get outside the box let me in was one  little thought I get letters and emails  from people all the time basically daily  telling me about Morgan's Wonderland I  love reading him but I got one the other  day I want to share with you and it's  this lady who this young lady who was  leaving with her daughter who was  autistic and as they were walking out to  the car the young daughter said mom did  we just leave heaven and when she told  me that I thought to myself we've got a  little heaven here on earth at Morgan's  one life thank you very much the  opportunity"
The value of travel,Rick Steves,"Thank you very much. You know, I have spent a third of my adult life living out of a suitcase. And looking back on those 30 years, four months every year of traveling, it occurs to me, it's really clear that travel, thoughtful travel, is well worth the time and the money. And I'd like to take just a few minutes to explain to you why. Nature Travel opens us up to the wonders of our world. In so many ways, it helps you appreciate nature. I mean for me, a great day is walking high in the Swiss Alps, like tightroping on a ridge, on one side I've got lakes stretching all the way to Germany, on the other side the most incredible alpine panorama anywhere, the Eiger MÃ¶nch Jungfrau: cut glass peaks against that blue sky. And ahead of me I hear the long legato tones of an alphorn announcing that the helicopter-stocked mountain hut is open, it's just around the corner and the coffee schnapps is on. Culture That connects you with nature, and that connects you with culture. And when I'm traveling I love this whole idea that travel connects us with culture. When I am traveling I find that there are different slices of culture that I never realized people could be evangelical about. Cheese, for instance. You go to France and they're crazy about cheese! I like being a bumpkin in my travels. For me, cheese was always just orange and in the shape of the bread. There you go: cheese sandwich. Cheese (Laughter) Then I meet these people and, I mean, there's a different cheese for every day of the year! You step into a cheese shop and it's just a festival of mold. (Laughter) I love going shopping with my Parisian friends, they'll take me into a cheese shop, put up a moldy wad of goat cheese take a deep whiff: ""Oh Rick! Smell this cheese! It smells like the feet of angels!"" Connecting with people (Laughter) Okay! Well when you're traveling you open up to new things that might smell like the feet of angels. A great thing about travel is that it connects you with people. And, if I am making a tour, or a guidebook or a TV show, and I am not connecting people with people I am kind of nervous, because it's going to be a flat experience. It's people that really make your experience vital. That's the mark of a good trip. It doesn't need to be earth-shaking encounters, they can be just silly encounters. I was in Italy recently and I met this little kid. He was just staring at me, he was kind of rude. Finally his dad said: ""Excuse my son, he stares at Americans."" (Laughter) I said: ""Why's that?"" and he said: ""Last week, we were at McDonald's having our hamburger, and my son, noticing the fluffy white bun, said: ""Dad? Why do Americans have such soft bread?"" and the dad said: ""Son, that's because Americans have no teeth."" (Laughter) misunderstandings So, I showed him my teeth and I sort of straightened out a little misunderstanding between peoples there and it occurred to me: that there are so many misunderstandings between people, and when we travel we straighten them out. I don't know about you, but I was raised thinking the world is a pyramid, with us on top and everybody else trying to figure it out. (Laughter) Then I travelled and I realized we have the American dream, that's a great thing, but other people have their own dream. Norwegians have the Norwegian dream. Bulgarians have the Bulgarian dream. These people have the Sri Lankan dream. Travel wallops my ethnocentricity, and I'm very thankful for that. It's something to celebrate! Our dream is beautiful, but so is theirs. In my travels I have really been impressed by the amount of pride on this planet. Wonderful pride. I was in Afghanistan once, in a cafeteria where the backpackers were hanging out, a man sat down next to me and said: ""Can I join you?"", I said: ""You already have."" (Laughter) ""You're an American, aren't you?"" I said: ""Yeah"", ""I'm a professor here in Afghanistan, I want you to know that a third of the people on this planet eat with spoons and forks like you do. A third of the people eat with chopsticks, and a third eat with their fingers, like I do, and we are all civilized just the same"". He had a chip on his shoulder. He thought I thought less of him because he ate with his fingers. That lesson stuck with me and for the rest of my trip through South Asia I was aware of that. I went to restaurants, fine restaurants with well-dressed professional local people that had no spoons and forks. They had like a ceremonial sink in the middle of the restaurant, people would wash their hands and eat using their fingers the way God intended them to be used. It actually became quite natural for me. I had to be re-trained when I got home. heroes (Laughter) But these are the lessons you pick up and it is so fun to change something that you thought was a basic truth. Well, in the adulthood you realize: Hey! Other people, smart people, can see it differently. I'm impressed how many heroic struggles are going on on this planet all the time that I am completely oblivious to. Every year, eight or ten distinct languages go extinct. That's eight or ten ethnic groups that lose a long struggle. I was raised thinking Nathan Hale, Ethan Allen, Patrick Henry they were the ultimate. Ah! Well you know they are great, but they're certainly not unique. They're a dime a dozen on this planet. It doesn't diminish ours but it's really important for us to remember in our travels that there are other heroes and other causes. One great way to make your travels more meaningful is to relate to, to embrace a contemporary Nathan Hale, in a different country. Get into it. An easy one is: Archbishop Oscar Romero. Go down to San Salvador, El Salvador, and learn about Archbishop Oscar Romero. A present-day Nathan Hale. A few years ago I was due for a vacation. I was heading for MazatlÃ¡n, and I was just needy for a nice stretch of pristine beach, swept free of local riffraff. Romero (Laughter) I was gonna have a plastic strap on my wrist, giving me unlimited margaritas, never have to dirty my fingers with coins, you know what that's like, I was ready. And then some friends invited me to go to San Salvador for the 25th anniversary of the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero. He marched with his people. He stood by his people during the Civil war that they lost. These were the landless peasants. He said: ""I'll probably be killed, and when I'm killed I'll raise again in my people"". And I wanted to see Romero in his people, 25 years after his assassination. And I went to El Salvador. Two days into that trip I was covered with bug bites, in a sweaty dorm bunk bed, eating rice and beans one day and beans and rice the next, (Laughter) and I was having the greatest travel experience you can ever ever have. It changed my whole outlook, it was really valuable to me. And I marched with those people and in El Salvador we came upon a monument that looks a lot like a monument we all know and love: the Vietnam Memorial in Washington D.C.. It's a knock-off of that Memorial, right there in the Capital city of El Salvador with just as many names chipped onto that black granite. The only difference is these are names of people who died fighting you and me. Maybe they were Communists and we had to kill them all, I don't know, it's not an issue of -- what is the reason for that, there's a reality: there's 50,000 widows who died fighting us, for a cause. And I want to know that cause, I want to empathize with that cause. I don't need to agree with it, but I want to appreciate it. That's why I went to Iran, a few years ago, I had the great opportunity to go to Iran with a Public television TV crew to make a show. People asked me: ""Why are you going to Iran?"" And I thought about it, why am I going to Iran? And it occurred to me: I'm going here because I think it's good character to know people before you bomb them. (Applause) (Laughter) Iran Sometimes we have to kill people, but it should hurt. And it is a nation's inclination to dehumanize its enemies before we go kill them. So I went to Iran. It occurred to me, when I was in Iran, I was afraid to go here. And when I got there, I was so glad I had the courage to go there. And I learned once again that fear, and there's a lot of it in our society, fear is to me for people who don't get out very much. (Applause) What makes Iran tick Now when you go to Iran: it's a thriving country of 70 million people. I want to know what makes them tick. Their Capital city Tehran, with about 12 million people, and there's a veneer of hatred there, I mean look at the banner there: It's a 8-story tall American flag made of dropping bombs and skulls for stars and stripes, saying ""Down with America"". We've all heard about ""Death to America"" and so on. I was in a taxi in that traffic jam there, later on that day, just silent, and suddenly my driver just bursts out: ""Death to traffic!"" (Laughter) Death to traffic And I go: ""Wait a minute! I thought it was ""Death to Israel"" or ""Death to America"""" and he said: ""Right now it's death to traffic!"" (Laughter) And I said: ""But well what is that?"" and he said: ""You're in Iran, anytime something's frustrating to us and out of our control, we say ""Death to that"" (Laughter) And I thought about that, I'm so glad I'm here to understand this with a little more sophistication than a bumper sticker. So he speaks Farsi, he doesn't speak English, he's translating it directly and to him he's saying ""Damn that"". I thought well, have I ever said ""Damn something""? Have I ever thought ""Damn those teenagers"" Oh yeah! I have. (Laughter) Baggage You know, do I really want them to die and burn in hell for eternity? No! It's just after midnight, turn down the music. Damn those teenagers! (Laughter) So, when we travel we gain a little better appreciation of what is the baggage that people are carrying when they respond to us. Think of the baggage we have in our country after 9/11. We are a mighty nation of 300 million people, we lost 3,000 people on 9/11, ten years ago, and it's part of our baggage, just like for our parents it was the Depression, World War II and so on. Iran has got baggage and we need to understand that if we're going to deal with them smartly. Their baggage, and they've got one quarter of our population, is losing several hundred thousand people when Saddam Hussein, funded by the United States, invaded their country. I don't know if we really funded him, but they think we did, and that is baggage, and when you travel around Iran every town has got a vast martyr cemetary filled with victims of that war. And for me, to see a widow, sitting on the tomb of a dead loved one, as she's done every week for decades, knowing the propaganda she's lived through and the struggle she's lived through: that's baggage. I've got to understand what she's going through if I can understand their country better. I wanted to know what makes 70 million Iranians tick, and I found out a lot by going to Iran and actually traveling there. I was standing on the street corner one day, a woman crosses the street, she said: ""Are you a journalist from America?"" I said ""Yeah."" She did one of those little ""point-on-my-chest"" things she said: ""I want you to go home and tell the truth. We're united, we're strong, and we just don't want our little girls to be raised like Britney Spears"". (Laughter) I said: ""We've got something in common here!"" And I thought about that: What's her baggage? Well, you know, they grew up with the Shah on the throne. And if you grow up with the Shah on the throne, back then, they were bragging the miniskirts are shorter in Paris than they are in Tehran; you don't want your little girl to become a boy-toy, a crass material and a drug addict, and for good reasons, given her situation she was afraid of that. I wanted to know what is the core constituency of the fear-mongering party that rules that country. And I learned that it's small town, less educated, fundamentalist parents. Good people, motivated by the same thing their counterparts are here, in the United States: Fear and love. That's a powerful lesson you cannot learn watching TV. You need to go there and meet these people. A great sort of learning area, wading pool for world exploration to me is Europe. It's kind of my beat! I love going to Europe because we have smart similar people dealing with similar problems and coming up with different answers; we can compare notes. Europe and America are both wealthy Christian democratic capitalist societies. we're all passionate about government by and for the people. I thought about this and I think there's a difference. Here in the United States we're all about government by and for the people, via the corporations we own. That's not a judgmental statement, that's just a kind of an observation, and it might make sense for a government to provide a good environment for our corporations to prosper. I think in Europe they've got government by and for the people in spite of the corporations they own. I think their government goes to bat for the future, for the poor and for the environment, at the expense of their businesses. (Applause) Morality I'm fascinated by how the United States is really into legislating morality. In Europe, they've got the same victimless crime issues and they have different approaches to them. My friends in Europe always remind me: a society has to make a choice, tolerate alternative life styles or build more prisons. And they always remind me we lock up 8 times more people per capita as they do. Either we are inherently more criminal, or there's something funny about our laws. Prostitution Prostitution is a good example. You travel in Europe you realize in a lot of countries prostitution is legal. Prostitution is not good, nobody would say that, but it's a pragmatic kind of harm reduction that motors their laws and policies about this issue. They would rather have a situation where sex workers are unionized, in order to get a license they have to be checked by a doctor or a nurse, so they're not spreading diseases, so when they push their emergency button a pimp doesn't come to their rescue, but a policeman does. It doesn't work perfectly, but that's their attempt to deal with this problem. We can learn from them. I think it's interesting when you go to Scandinavia how many drunk teenagers you find on decorated trucks. (Laughter) Drinking and Driving And finally I asked: ""What's going on?"" And it was always in the spring, like May and June, they said: ""Here in Scandinavia our kids really get drunk in graduation time and the parents don't want them to drink and drive. So, in a classic European sort of example of pragmatic harm reduction when it comes to solve drugs, the Scandinavian parents pay the keggers, they hire a truck and a driver, let the kids decorate it, and the kids go from house to house and their parents serve them the beer. Scandinavian Example (Laughter) Now, in the United States, we'd deal with this problem -- teens drinking and driving on graduation -- with moralism. ""Just say no"". In Scandinavia, they would rather have a situation where, okay, the kids are going to drink anyways, let's do it so they don't have to lie to their parents, so nobody drives and nobody dies. That's an example that we can learn from. (Applause) I was in a Starbucks in Zurich, a couple of years ago, I went down to the bathroom downstairs, stepped inside: blue lights! I thought: ""what's this? Blue lights in the toilet?"" Then I realized oh! I cannot see my veins. I couldn't shoot up if I wanted to. Lot of needle addicts, lot of junkies on the streets of Europe, because they're still alive and they're not in prison. (Laughter) Needle Vending Machine I have to explain that to my groups. They say: ""These darn Liberal Europeans!"" I thought well this is frustrating for a junkie, you can't shoot up in the bathroom at Starbucks, (Laughter) So then, across the street, I noticed a machine that used to sell tobacco and now it sells syringes, government-subsidized syringes, they're almost free; nobody shares needles and passes diseases in Switzerland, that would be, like, unthinkable. The government is into pragmatic, compassionate harm reduction for the solutions to their problems. And then down the street from this needle vending machine there's a heroin maintenance counter called a ""Cafe Fix"", where people can go and get their addiction maintained, get counseling, get their lives back on track, get a job. It's not right or wrong, but they're learning, and we can learn from them. And it's a valuable thing about travel as we struggle with persistent problems. When comes to marijuana, of course Europe is much more progressive in this regard. In Holland, the coffee shops sell marijuana. Now, a lot of Americans worry that there's a whole reservoir of people that would love to ruin their lives smoking marijuana if only it was legal. (Laughter) Marijuana Well, it's been 25 years since they arrested a pot smoker in the Netherlands and what they found after 25 years is: use does not go up. As a matter of fact, by every measure Dutch people, young and old, smoke half the marijuana per capita that we do here in the United States. Portugal legalized the consumption of all drugs 10 years ago. A lot of Americans are worried about the gateway element of marijuana; you know, you smoke marijuana and suddenly you're a heroin addict. In Portugal they worried about that too, and they found the only thing gateway about marijuana is its illegality, because when it's illegal you've got to buy it from a criminal on the street who has an invested interest in getting you hooked on something more addictive and more profitable. We can learn from Europeans, and it's exciting. (Applause) Switzerland I love to have European friends as a sounding boards so I can test out ideas and confusions and frustrations for me. I've got a good friend in Switzerland who's a school teacher, in a little traditional village where almost everybody has the same last name. When I visit with Olle, his wife Maria and their kids, I love to ask them questions. Recently, I asked Olle: ""How can you Swiss people so docilely pay such high taxes?"" Without missing a beat he said: ""What's it worth to be living in a country where there's no homelessness, no hunger, where everybody, regardless of the wealth of their parents, has access to quality health care and education. (Applause) Rich vs Poor Now, Olle is not a crusader. Olle is just a capitalist with a European social ethic. And it's interesting to learn from them. One thing occurred to me recently is: Americans are loving, compassionate people, but we're not very good at grabbling with the gap between the rich and the poor. There's something in our upbringing that makes it very tough to deal with, honestly. When you travel, you have the poor reaching into your window. You can't escape it if you're traveling honestly. And for 30 years I've had the poor reaching in my window. And it's been a powerful impact in the value of my travel. And I'll tell you: I've learned that even if you're motivated only by greed if you know what's good for you, you don't want to be filthy rich in a desperately poor world. It's just not a pretty picture. I was down in El Salvador last Christmas, any middle-class neighbourhood has to pull its money to have an armed guard on the corner, just to protect them from angry poor people. And you don't want to raise your kids behind designer fortifications. We're on a track to that if we don't learn from the other parts of the world that have not dealt with this very smartly. Let me finish by taking you to Turkey. I just love Turkey, and as a tour guide I had the chance to take a group to get to know a whirling dervish. I knew this dervish, and I asked him: ""Can our group come and watch you pray?"" He said: ""Well, I'm not a photo op. You can watch me pray, but I want you to know what I'm doing"". I said: ""Great"". So we went onto his roof, the sun was setting, he was wearing his robe and his hat, and he said, now I'll just paraphrase it: ""I'm a dervish, that's like a monk that follows Mevlana, that's sort of a teacher in Islam, like Saint Francis was for Christianity. A teacher of love. And as a dervish I pray five times a day, meditating on the teachings of Mevlana. I plant one foot in my community and my home, the other foot goes around the world acknowledging the variety in God's great creation. One hand goes up to receive the love of our Creator, and the other hand, like the spout on a tea kettle, goes down to shower God's love on his creation. And I whirl, and I whirl, and I lose myself in that transe thinking of the teachings of Mevlana"". To be there as tour guide with my group, watching him, his head tilted over his robe, then goes out, and he loses himself in that beautiful path. I thought: ""Wow, I am really understanding now, like my group was, that this man is very different from us, but he is fundamentally the same. And if we take home that understanding, that's the very best souvenir possible. And the rest of our lives, when we look at the rest of the world, rather than fear its diversity, we can better celebrate it. Now, appreciating the value of travel is nothing new. 1400 years ago Mohammed said: ""Don't tell me how educated you are, tell me how much you've traveled"". Thomas Jefferson traveled and he wrote that travel makes a person wiser, if less happy. Conclusion (Laughter) Mark Twain traveled and he famously wrote: ""Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness"". I've traveled and travel has inspired me to be engaged, and to do what I can to make a difference. In other words, it's helped me to become a better citizen of this planet. And I hope thoughtful travels can do the same for you. Thank you very much."
Transformando imposibles en realidades,Yanina Aubrey-Gimenez,"As soon as you leave the place where you were born, you meet the narrative created about that place and its people. The narrative that exists about Paraguay is still very scarce and very limited. And, as Dichi said, the problem is that it creates stereotypes: Paraguay has a lot of corruption, Paraguay is one of the poorest countries in Latin America, Paraguay can play football. As you know, none of that is false, and yet, it isn't the whole truth. So the vision it gives us about the country is very simplistic, very limited. The will to change that simplistic and limited narrative was probably the main motivation for the project I'm going to talk about today to come about. In 2003, I was working in London as a consultant. Part of my job was to outline possible future scenarios of what the world would look like in 20, 25, 50 years. I did this for the directors of big international companies, to help them refine their vision and strategy for the mid and long term. One of the pivotal transforming tendencies that I saw transforming these scenarios was the need to rethink the focus of the manufacturing industries, considering not only profitability and innovation, but also their environmental and social impact. In parallel, and more or less at the same time, I began to realize that Paraguay had all the necessary conditions to become a centre of innovation and production for sustainable products given the huge amount of natural resources we have here. When my sister Norah visited me in 2004, she joined the project, which at that time had neither name nor too definite a shape, but did already have three fundamental pillars on which we were starting to build: sustainability, design and innovation. So we started to connect ideas and to try to create possibilities. We looked at available resources, and also limitations, but tried not to focus on them, rather on the opportunities, and consider the target markets, which, at first, were Europe, and the UK in particular. The UK has a very open economy, but so too a market which is very dynamic and incredibly competitive. This presented a very interesting challenge for us, because no matter what product we decided to produce, it had to be not good, but exceptional, if we wanted to find a niche in this difficult market. By the end of 2004, with the imminent birth of my first daughter in 2005, we finally decided on developing a fashion line for children. From within the existing technological, capital and equipment limitations, innovation arose. And ""Aravore"" was born. A brand with very special characteristics: The raw material would be from a source as sustainable as possible. To start with, locally produced organic cotton. We would make use of the local know-how and skills such as crochet. Production would not be like in a traditional factory where a worker sits for eight hours making one collar after another. We would have each person work on the production of one garment, from beginning to end. It might not be the best formula in terms of productivity, but when considering the satisfaction of the person making the product, I think it's the best option. Finally, we would aim at exporting a product of high quality, and at exporting a finished product, with its own brand name, so the most value-added possible was created in the country. That's how Aravore started: offering products with a tangible history, with a clear aesthetic and design identity; making products with a name and recognition, handmade or hand-finished products, using haute couture techniques incompatible with mass production. But the most important is that these products establish a human connection, a connection between the person buying the product and all the people involved in its creation. And I think this is the greatest innovation that Aravore brings to the market. During this process we realized that we were already beginning to change a little that narrow narrative about Paraguay by producing something positive, new and innovative, 100% Paraguayan, that was already beginning to be exported round world. But what's even more important is: I think we were also changing the internal narrative. The narrative within the people who started to form Aravore, within those women seeing their work being displayed in the world's best shops and being recognized by the press as being of excellent quality. But we were also changing the internal narrative of local companies, which, at first, were quite sceptical about our project. And suddenly even one or two officials from the public sector dared to dream of new horizons for local companies. Although, I must admit, much of the advice we gave to the public sector over the last few years seems to have fallen on deaf ears. At the start, we identified high transportation costs and the enormous difficulties that exist in putting the product on the export market as the main obstacles. With the idea of contributing to changing that, we commissioned and paid for a study that centred on the development of a modern airport in Paraguay, taking advantage of its strategic position within South America. We handed this project on to several ministers and it's filed away in several offices. If someone is interested, let me know. Another project on which we're working is an innovation centre for sustainable textiles with a comprehensive approach involving all the companies involved in this sector, from primary production, to spinning mills, dye-works, textile mills, small workshops, garment finishers, packers, and also the universities, so that they can develop technologies applicable to this sector relating to design. This is a proposal also held in several offices both in the private and public sector. And talking about obstacles, the main obstacle we had at the start was trying to convince people that this was a realizable project. And I'd like to read to you a few of the comments we heard the most: ""No, that's impossible!"" ""You'll never be able to work with organic cotton."" ""No, you can't spin such a small amount."" ""Nobody will want to dye such a small amount of yarn."" ""You'll never produce a product that is good enough."" ""And even if you do, it'll be good at first, but then it'll start falling short."" ""No way! How are you going to sell abroad?"" ""You're not going to sell abroad. No one will buy it."" ""Who will want to buy clothes made with raw cotton?"" -- Well, our first collection was ten items made purely with organic raw cotton and someone did want to buy -- It would have been easy to throw in the towel just then because the lack of faith was really depressing. But as Hermann Hesse said, ""In order to achieve the possible, one must repeatedly attempt the impossible."" But besides the obstacles, I'd like to talk about the successes, because at the end of the day, they are way more important. And besides all the recognition we got, nationally and internationally, the recognition of the specialized press, the recognition of the people buying our products, for me, the most important achievement is the positive impact that I see Aravore has had and still has in many people's lives. One of the first girls who joined Aravore doing crochet, also learned to sew and weave and got to know aspects of quality control and is now the manager of her own workshop with ten people working for her. She makes us all at Aravore really proud. Another girl of whom we are really proud joined the team as a cleaner at our first workshop. But she also wanted to learn, how to sew, knit, and do all that has to do with producing a high quality product. She is now the manager of her own workshop, too. But the most important is that she is the main supporter of her family and her two beautiful children. This makes me happy because after all, this is Aravore's raison d'etre. I wanted to share with you all today how and why Aravore was born, because maybe there is someone in the audience who too has an impossible project that they're afraid of taking on. The only thing I can say is: Go for it! Maybe, at first, not everything will turn out as you had dreamed but you won't get anywhere without trying. Unfortunately, I can't give you a magic formula. You have to work hard. No, not hard: harder than you can imagine. 365 days a year. And more. You have to have patience, you have to have passion, and you have to maintain it and keep at it no matter what. And it's also essential to keep clear in your mind the aim of the project and why that's its aim, because when things get tough, it's something we need to remember. And we need to keep telling it to everyone working with us. But if, besides having an impossible project, you have a visionary project, too, a project trying to change the traditional way of doing things, trying to generate new paradigms, then, I get excited, too. Because one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you today was because I wanted to introduce you to the concept of the social enterprise. I think this is a very important concept that may not be limited to Paraguay and Latin America, but rather is a concept that is changing the business sector around the world. Corporate social responsibility as an add-on department, as a department separated from the core of a business, is, for me, something of the past. Companies of the future will need to incorporate this beyond making money in their objectives and ambitions. Not because making money is bad. Making money is essential; but is not enough. The social enterprise model is a model that can help us turn many impossibilities into realities. Of that I am convinced. It's a model that can help us tear down stereotypes and that can help us to create new stories. I want to leave you with a reflection by one of my favourite authors, E M Forster, who in his book, ""Howards End"", says: ""Only connect ..."" Only, connect. Dare to make connections between seemingly unalike ideas. Dare to connect seemingly remote places, dare to make connections between seemingly different people, and between seemingly opposite interests. And you'll see how extraordinary things can happen. Thank you very much.   "
The science of vacation: Ian Cole at TEDxOrlando,Ian Cole,31% now I'm a visual learner I bet many of you are as well so when I see a number like 31% I need a good visual representation of it so could I get the first six rows of the audience to please stand up now this is about a 100 people right around 31% and this is the statistical portion of the population that will die from what is the leading cause of death worldwide thank you can be seated the leading cause of death worldwide is cardiovascular disease now this is actually a group of diseases that affect the heart and the blood vessels but this isn't a surprise our doctors health organizations governments have been warning us for years about the risks of a poor diet a lack of exercise and reminding us that smoking kills and while these are the three primary contributors to cardiovascular disease there's a fourth that doesn't get as much attention and that is stress Pulitzer Prize winner Renee Duo stated what happens in the mind of a man is always reflected in the diseases of his body and it's true stress in the mind causes the blood vessels to constrict and it raises our blood pressure elevates our heart rate now one way that we can avoid long-term stress and damage to our heart is through our vacations now I've always believed that vacations are good for us and I've even heard anecdotally that vacations can reduce our stress and even prevent a heart attack but I always wondered about the science behind statements like that the science of The science of vacation vacation and so a few months ago I stopped wondering I partnered with a colleague who had a background in Psychology research and as we started pouring through the materials Jessica and I noticed something that was really profound that stress relief was a lot like Diet exercise and smoking many of us know what to do but we don't reap the benefits one study in particular was a long-term study of more than 12000 middle-aged men and at the end of nine years they concluded that those men who took regular annual vacations had a decreased risk of heart attack and death now that's pretty compelling now as we looked at the research we looked more and more we found a few things that we wanted to share in particular we came up with a formula that can maximize the happiness the stress relief that you get from any given vacation now I can't write you a prescription for a relaxing vacation I can't tell you what destination or travel companions or activities will reduce your stress you'll have to do your your own rigorous research to determine those things but in sharing that formula we think you can maximize the happiness that you get from a given vacation so let's get to it the first variable in our formula is anticipation now if you're anything like I used to be a vacation is something you book very very quickly when some magical period of time opens on your calendar and in Booking it at the last minute sometimes you get a great travel deal but other times you can't get what you want or you have to pay far too much for it now this was me until about 2003 that year my lovely wife candy sat me down and explained in no uncertain terms that one I work in the Vacation Ownership industry two we hadn't taken a real vacation in years three I was going to fix that now she was right every day I go to work and I work to improve the vacations of other people but I wasn't applying that same discipline at home home and I had the stress but what I hadn't learned to do yet was treat an upcoming vacation and booking earlier as an opportunity to have a kind of a pressure release valve to be able to look forward on a tough day and say oh but at least that great vacation is around the corner and sure enough when we looked at the research we found a great study that compared the happiness levels of vacationers and non- vacationers and we expected to find a great link between the happiness and the vacation but what we were surprised to find is that the biggest difference in happiness is actually the period before the vacation not after and researchers concluded that it is this positive anticipation effect that makes the difference now there can be a financial reason as well the airline reporting Corporation tracks fairs for major destinations recently they published that in 2011 the best time to buy a summer plane ticket in and out of Europe was was actually 5 months in advance in and out of the Caribbean 2 and 1/2 months so it can also pay to plan ahead and the second variable in our Relaxation formula is relaxation in that study of vacation happiness they found that those individuals who noted their vacation was either relaxing or very relaxing had significantly higher levels of post vacation happiness and that post vacation happiness lasted far longer in some cases up to 8 weeks after returning from their trip now to have a relaxing vacation you're going to need to avoid some of the pitfalls in expedia's 2011 vacation deprivation study over 70% of individuals reported that they check their work email or voicemail while on vacation not good now if I can figure out how to vacation at properties managed and staffed by my co-workers I bet you can find a way to avoid that device for a few days the second Pitfall that we need to avoid is unrealistic expectations if you expect no travel delays perfect weather well- behaved kids and that you'll see it all and do it all in one short vacation you're going to be very disappointed instead set realistic expectations and enjoy the positive moments that come when you easily exceed those expectations and when those positive moments happen capture them take lots of photos videos whatever momentos will remind you of them later because we're going to return home very soon to all that stress we left behind now when we do get home and that flood of stress comes back we're going to employ the third variable in our formula which is Capitalisation capitalization now psychologists Define capitalization as the process of one person telling another about a positive event and this has several very specific outcomes first when telling about the positive event say a great vacation memory we're storytelling we're recalling it and this serves to further cement it in our memory the second effect is that when the other person responds in an active and constructive manner it makes us feel even better about the event that we already enjoyed so by taking just a little time to share our vacation memories with others we not only feel even better about them we remember them far longer now one of the ways that I capitalize is that I take our best family vacation photos I have them done and we put them all over the walls in our home and our offices and this all leads to constantly talking to someone and storytelling about a great vacation memory others have shared some great tips one of my favorite buy a bottle of wine while you're on vacation when you get home that stress returns throw a little dinner party pop open that bottle of wine share it with some friends and tell those stories all over Commitment again and so by booking earlier and leaving time for a positive anticipation happiness benefit and then avoiding the pitfalls and enjoying a relaxing vacation and then by capitalizing telling other people about it later we can maximize the happiness that comes from that vacation reducing our stress and improving our health just a little bit now one great vacation is good but remember we need commitment to regular annual vacations an expedia's vacation deprivation study tells us that we're not so committed when you look at vacation days worldwide on average respondents got 24 vacation days and still left four behind but in the US The Situation's far worse only 14 days of vacation on average and we still don't use two of them and let's be real we don't use vacation days always for relaxing vacations do we now my hope is as more people learn about the science of vacation we'll make better choices but what excuses do people have for not using all their vacation days well clearly finances are apart 22% say they can't afford it another 16% say they can get paid for unused vacation days others are afraid of how they'll be perceived or that some important decision will be made without them but my favorite response in this whole study 10% of people say they don't use their vacation days because work is my life now I bet we work with people like that uh they need their vacation the most we need them to take their vacation so by knowing more about the science of vacation we can make better choices and we can give our heart a rest now even after my wife candy talked to me in 2003 we did a better job we took some more but I still didn't have a great personal commitment to regular annual vacations I needed a bit of a wakeup call and this happened in 2007 I was sitting in an airport and I thought I was having a heart attack um luckily I wasn't and I went I talked to my doctor and you know it was just one business trip after another and when I when I talked to him I knew things needed to change and so I did the right things I lost weight fixed my diet started exercising I now stay about 70 pounds lighter than I once was and now I remain committed to regular annual vacations and for my final point I'd like to share a quick memory from one of those vacations this summer my family went to Maui this is us at the top of hakala and while we were on Maui we took the road to Hana this great twisty road that goes around the backside of Maui and we pulled over at this one park and we heard about this this waterfall but to get to this waterfall you had to go through a bunch of mud under some bushes across this old aquaduct but we were we were up for an adventure that day so we went we got to the top of this hill and looked down in this awesome waterfall in this big pool so we made our way down we stuck a toe in the water it was just a little cold as our son Andrew would tell you here now we got in the water cuz we were up for an adventure we swam all all the way across this pool we had our photo taken under this waterfall it was awesome we got back we dry off and our son Adam declares declares mind you that he's not going to get mud on him the entire way back to the car now we get about a minute down the path and sure enough his little brother accidentally splashes mud on him next thing you know they're on the ground throwing punches the way that only two brothers can remember that point about well- behaved kids so we get them up we kind of help them back down the path and Adam hurts his foot on a rock now here's his little brother helping him down the path back to the car remember they're the ones that were punching each other a few minutes ago so we get all the way back home and a few weeks later I'm kind of thinking about the trip and I ask Adam what was the best part of the whole Hawaii trip you know what he says fighting in the mud with my brother wow so what's great about that memory is it strikes me that you don't have to fly halfway around the world you don't have to spend a lot of money to have a great vacation memory like that and that memory reminds me of a fantastic quote a vacation is like love anticipated with pleasure experienced with discomfort yet remembered with Nostalgia thank you  
Aisha Chaudhary: Finding happiness,Aisha Chaudhary,"My story is different from most because I had to undergo a bone marrow transplant when I was just 6 months old and now I have Pulmonary Fibrosis which is a serious lung disease and my lung capacity is now only 20%. My name is Aisha Chaudhary and I am 17-years-old and today I would like to talk about -- what really matters most to me in life. Now life can be tough when every single breath you take is a struggle. And the slightest infection causes a serious life-threatening exacerbation. And the last one for me was in November last year when I went from being able to walk around freely and go to school to suddenly being bedridden unable to turn over in bed without getting out of breath. And I must confess that I did wonder if I was going to die and I would have sleepless nights just thinking tossing and turning with this idea that -- soon I may be gone and if that is going to happen -- then what's the point of anything? I'd think about this for hours and get nowhere but then it suddenly struck me that I am not really alone in all of this is it not true that not just me but all of us are going to die one day. Yes all of us are going to die. I'd like you all to just think about that for a moment. In the next 100 years all of us sitting in this room today will be gone. Just at different times some sooner than the others. So then If death is the ultimate truth what should really matter most in life? The only thing that matters to me is being happy and happiness is a choice one makes it's simply an attitude I can either choose to be happy and try to smile through all of my difficult times or I can choose to be miserable and get overwhelmed by it all. Now it's not that by being miserable that I am going to get any better. So I may as well choose to be happy. And if I have to have Pulmonary Fibrosis I choose to have a happy Pulmonary Fibrosis. Now I would like to share with you a few difficult moments in the recent past where I have chosen to be happy. This year I was quite unwell and I had to undergo several medical tests. And one such test was a sleep study done to check if my oxygen levels were okay when I sleep. And this picture was taken right before the study and you can see that I am almost trapped in a bunch of wires some stuck to my face and some to my body to monitor my heart my brain and my breathing. Despite all of this I am still smiling because I refuse to let this illness get the better of me. I just won't let it. And I chose to find humor in observing the man who was doing my sleep study. I couldn't help but laugh at the way he would just put up his own feet on my bed and go off to sleep himself snoring away. And this obviously made it difficult for me to sleep and maybe that's why my results were so bad. """"How ridiculous! I thought to myself. Later that month my family and I had to go to England for a full medical check-up. And the days were filled with long boring medical appointments talking about lung transplant and what seemed like endless amounts of tests. This is a picture of my brother and I just after I had spent one long day at the hospital. But guess where we were headed in this photo -- to see a broadway show in London. And it was fabulous I was able to put the trauma of the day at the hospital behind me. And I still managed to find the will and the excitement in going out for a play and spending quality time with my brother. I believe that it's important to create many happy memories so that we can try to wipe out the sad ones. After having quite an unpleasant summer with all of these medical issues my family and I decided to take a holiday to the Maldives and there was so much to do in the Maldives. But of course my health didn't permit me to do a lot of the things that I wanted to. And one of the main activities was snorkeling and I desperately wanted to try it. But how could a person who has difficulty breathing go snorkeling? Well in this picture you can see me in my snorkeling gear right after I had popped my head out of the water I'd seen the most beautiful vibrant coloured fish. And I am not going to lie I did only dip my head in for a second but I did what I wanted to do and that moment for me was worth everything. And I felt extreme hapiness and was even surprised at myself for doing something that everyone wasn't sure was really possible. So happiness is clearly a choice one can make. No matter what no matter where -- you can find it if you look for it. In fact Tom Wilson once said """" A smile is happiness you can find right under your nose."""" I feel that happiness is also doing what you truly love. And for me my love is for art simply because it allows me to express myself in such a beautiful and unique way. As I dip my brush in the vibrant colours of paint and can almost feel the paint being smeared on to the fabric of the canvas I tend to forget all of my worries and the difficult situation that I am really in. And art makes me happy because it almost becomes a whole another world where I can escape at lease for a little while. And these days my most favorite subject to paint is dogs. And now I would like to introduce you to my own two dogs Coby the labrador and Rolo the black pug. You can see who the dominant one is in the relationship. I find it so interesting that even though they can't speak a word dogs can become the closest thing to your heart your very best friend and your companion. I love to observe them and try to figure them out and I can't help but get inspired dogs are so similar to humans yet they carry qualities that we humans struggle to achieve at times. Dogs can find happiness in the smallest of things dogs are delighted with a walk ecstatic with a small treat and in heaven when you tickle their belly. Now I would like to share with you a few paintings I have done recently that were inspired by these two guys. The first one is of Coby and is capturing a snapshot of my everyday life just lying on my bed and watching movies just as I love to do. The next one it's inspired by my gorgeous pug Rolo and the legendary rock band Guns N' Roses. And now all of this doesn't mean that life is always one big song and dance it really isn't. Of course there are days when I feel extremely down where I feel like simply curling up into a ball and just giving up but then the realization that things could always be much much worse -- always pushes me to get back up on my feet and put a smile on my face. I could have easily been born into a family that wasn't as loving and caring as my own. So I thank god for the family that I have. And I know for a fact that there are children out there who are much less fortunate that I am. And although I have this disease I am still grateful that I can walk around and do what I love to do. So happiness is an attitude happiness is doing what you truly love and I feel that happiness can only come from acceptance. I accept who I am I accept where I am at and I accept the challenges that I am battling with today. And I am even more determined to make the most of this wonderful gift of life that god has given me. As Anderson once said """" Enjoy life there is plenty of time to be dead."""" So I really hope that all of you enjoy your lives with as much happiness as you can possibly find. Thank you for listening. """
How Do We Handle Hard Times in Life? Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev Answers,Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev ,"When you will learn - ""how to handle my thought how to handle my emotion."""" We will give you tools how to figure this machine out... whatever the issue we will do our best but this should not be an issue. Questioner: In life there are many phases where we feel that we are depressed we are lonely and when everybody is against us and there's no one to you know guide us or talk about it. So at that moment how should we handle it or how should we deal with it? Me vs the Universe Sadhguru: See this is an unfortunate condition that a whole lot of human beings are in Ð in their experience in their personal experience life is like Òme versus the universeÓ. Being in competition with the universe is a stupid thing to do. That's not a competition you must get into. Hello? Me versus the universe is a bad competition to get into. Would you also agree with me? So this is why yoga. Yoga Yoga does not mean twisting and turning your body. The word yoga means union. Right now it's me versus the universe Ð this is just your psychological condition. This is not the reality. Even when you feel utterly lonely are you still breathing? So youÕre transacting with the world isn't it? Yes? You only can't get along with the people around you. But the atmosphere is okay with you. Food is okay if it tastes good. Water is okay. You have transaction with the world isn't it? Universe Your existence is constantly in engagement with the universe but your mind becomes against the universe. If you create a psychological condition that you are against or you're in competition with the universe or the cosmos obviously will feel crushed for small things. Little things will crush you. Small things When I say little things Ð maybe you failed your examination maybe you got thrown out of the university maybe you got fired from a job maybe somebody ditched you maybe something else like this happened. These are all small things between life and death. Because you came here with nothing isn't it? When you die there is no container service for you. You die with nothing. In spite of that most people have turned their homes into warehouses. Most people are carrying such a huge baggage on their head as if they're carrying the whole universe on their head. This is their own psychological condition. Your thought and emotion Your thought and emotion is what you're talking about. Right? When are you going to figure out how to handle your thought and emotion? Not hers not hers not his yours. When are you going to learn how to handle my thought and my emotion? At the end of your life? The only problem really with life is just this Ð most human beings have taken themselves too seriously. They do not understand. You've seen on the computer screen these pop-ups? You are a pop-up on this planet. (Laughter) You pop-up for two seconds and pop-out. (Applause) No no you must see countless number of people like you and me have walked this planet they were also big people. Where are they? All top soil? Top soil or no? Unless somebody your friends decided to bury you real deep fearing that you may raise from the dead. You know there have been such instances. You are already in heaven Or maybe you're planning to go to heaven. Hello? Anybody who talks about a place other than this place as a better place than this Ð this is a crime against humanity. My fundamental work is to destroy all heavens so that people will learn to live well here. All these idiots who made a hell out of themselves they want to go to heaven. They made a mess out of this place and then they want to go to heaven. I'm asking you do you have any proof? Do you have any proof that you are not already in heaven and messing it up? Do you have any proof? You're already in heaven making a mess out of it. Yes? Simply because you are not even learning how to handle your basic faculties of thought and emotion. IsnÕt it? Your only justification is ÒEverybody is like this onlyÓ Ð that's how it is in a madhouse. (Laughs) That is how it is in a madhouse only a doctor looks crazy. When will you handle it slowly So when are you going to handle it? Slowly at the age of sixty? IÕm asking. When will you learn how to handle my thought how to handle my emotion how to handle my body how to handle my chemistry Ð when are you going to figure this at the end of your life? Because this culture has grown Ð when to do spirituality means when you're seventy when you're no good for anything else. No. At the earliest possible time whatever is most profound about you not about heavens about this life everything that you need to know you must know soonest isn't it? Only then you'll live a sensible life. Story of Shankar You okay if we tell you a joke you won' t get offended? Because this is the most serious crowd I've ever seen in the last few years. Sadhguru (Talks aside): How many of them are journalists here? (Laughter) Panel Member: Most of them (Laughs) Most of them? Okay (Laughs/Laughter) This happened Ð Shankaran Pillai when he was in Paris was married to a French woman. One day it was their anniversary Ð first anniversary. So she invited a bunch of friends and she wanted to cook something really fresh everything fresh. So from morning she was driving him to this market that market. He got this fresh vegetables fresh meat fresh chicken this that everything. Then in the evening she said Ð because the French have this you know snail appetizer Ð she said ÒGo to the beach and get some snails fresh. And I will make some appetizer for all the friends who are coming.Ó So Shankaran Pillai went to the beach and he was picking up all the snails and putting in a bucket. Then he met an old friend an Indian guy they hit it off and they were talking about their old times he just forgot that he's married. You know when you meet old friends it happens. And both of them went to a bar and they had a few drinks and he just forgot. Then he realized then the snails were just climbing out and tak one snail fell out of the bucket. He realized ÒOh my god I'm supposed to take the snails. My wife French wife she's waiting.Ó So he said ÒI need to go.Ó And he went. By then it was already very late. He went he knew it's not Two Fantastic faculties going to be pleasant. So he came near the house and spilled all the snails on the ground threw away the bucket and went and knocked on the door. The French fury came. He turned back and said ÒCome on you guys. We're almost there. Come on. Let's go!Ó So when are you going to pick your snails and put them in the bucket and fix them? Hmm? Your problems you must fix them isnÕt it? These are not problems I want you to understand you are not suffering your life you're only suffering two fantastic faculties. It's a privilege of being human that we have these two fantastic faculties.One is we have a vivid sense of memory. This is because of this memory our life is so rich unlike any other creature and we have a fantastic sense of imagination. Now this is what you're suffering what happened ten years ago you can still suffer why? Are you suffering life or memory? Hello? Memory! What may happen day after tomorrow you're already suffering. Are you suffering life or imagination? Participants: Imagination. Sadhguru: Two most fantastic faculties you have you are suffering. So what are you asking for? You want to become once again an earthworm. An earthworm is a very eco-friendly creature I have nothing against it. You are not the issue But it took millions of years of evolution to get you a this size of brain and now you're suffering it. If we take away half your brain of course you will sit there without any anxiety without any suffering peacefully. What we need is we need to remove your brain because you're suffering your own intelligence yes or no? Because we gave you a very complex machine you have not bothered to read even the user's manual you want to just blunder around. No? Young people it's time you figure out a few things about you if you don't know how we will give you tools how to figure this machine out because in your life many issues will come more issues come up in your life means you're living a more active life. Nothing came up means you're not living. Yes lots of issues every day. I have the maximum number of trouble going on in my life on a daily basis because so much of activity around the world global level of activity only with volunteers okay? Volunteers means nobody is qualified for the job and you can't fire them for inefficiency and they love you what to do? So this one thing you must fix that is in your life you are not the issue okay? Whatever the issue weÕll do our best but this should not be the issue. "" "
El secreto de convertirse en una persona mentalmente fuerte | Amy Morin | TEDxOcala,Amy Morin,"So I have a Facebook friend whose life seems perfect. She lives in a gorgeous house. And she has a really rewarding career. And she and her family go on all these exciting adventures together on the weekends. And I swear that they must take a professional photographer along with them (Laughter) because no matter where they go or what they do the whole family just looks beautiful. And she's always posting about how blessed she is and how grateful she is for the life that she has. And I get the feeling that she's not just saying those things for the sake of Facebook but she truly means it. How many of you have a friend kind of like that? And how many of you kind of don't like that person sometimes? (Laughter) Bad habits cost us We all do this right? It's hard not to do. But that way of thinking costs us something. And that's what I want to talk to you about today-- is what our bad habits cost us. Maybe you've scrolled through your Facebook feed and you think """"So what if I roll my eyes? It's just five seconds of my time. How could it be hurting me?"""" Well researchers have found that envying your friends on Facebook actually leads to depression. That's just one of the traps that our minds can set for us. Have you ever complained about your boss? Or looked at your friends' lives and thought """"Why do they have all the luck?"""" You can't help thinking that way right? That way of thinking seems small in the moment. In fact it might even make you feel better in the moment. But that way of thinking is eating away at your mental strength. Unhealthy beliefs about ourselves There's three kinds of destructive beliefs that make us less effective and rob us of our mental strength. The first one is unhealthy beliefs about ourselves. We tend to feel sorry for ourselves. And while it's OK to be sad when something bad happens self-pity goes beyond that. It's when you start to magnify your misfortune. When you think things like """"Why do these things always have to happen to me?"""" """"I shouldn't have to deal with it."""" That way of thinking keeps you stuck keeps you focused on the problem keeps you from finding a solution. And even when you can't create a solution you can always take steps to make your life or somebody else's life better. But you can't do that when you're busy hosting your own pity party. The second type of destructive belief that holds us back is unhealthy beliefs about others. We think that other people can control us and we give away our power. But as adults who live in a free country there's very few things in life that you have to do. So when you say """"I have to work late you give away your power. Yeah maybe there will be consequences if you don't work late but it's still a choice. Unhealthy beliefs about the world Or when you say """"My mother-in-law drives me crazy you give away your power. Maybe she's not the nicest person on earth but it's up to you how you respond to her because you're in control. The third type of unhealthy belief that holds us back is unhealthy beliefs about the world. We tend to think that the world owes us something. We think """"If I put in enough hard work then I deserve success."""" But expecting success to fall into your lap like some sort of cosmic reward will only lead to disappointment. But I know it's hard to give up our bad mental habits. It's hard to get rid of those unhealthy beliefs that we've carried around with us for so long. But you can't afford not to give them up. Because sooner or later you're going to hit a time in your life where you need all the mental strength that you can muster. When I was 23 years old I thought I had life all figured out. I graduated from grad school. I landed my first big job as a therapist. I got married. And I even bought a house. And I thought """"This is going to be great!"""" """"I've got this incredible jump start on success."""" What could go wrong? That all changed for me one day What could go wrong when I got a phone call from my sister. She said that our mother was found unresponsive and she'd been taken to the hospital. My husband Lincoln and I jumped in the car and rushed to the hospital. We couldn't imagine what could be wrong. My mother was only 51. She didn't have any history of any kind of health problems. When we got to the hospital doctors explained she'd had a brain aneurysm. And within 24 hours my mother who used to wake up in the morning saying """"It's a great day to be alive passed away. That news was devastating to me. My mother and I had been very close. As a therapist I knew on an intellectual level how to go through grief. But knowing it and doing it can be two very different things. Remembering my mother It took a long time before I felt like I was really healing. And then on the three year anniversary of my mother's death some friends called and invited Lincoln and me to a basketball game. Coincidentally it was being played at the same auditorium where I'd last seen my mother on the night before she'd passed away. I hadn't been back there since. I wasn't even sure I wanted to go back. But Lincoln and I talked about it and ultimately we said """"Maybe that would be a good way to honor her memory."""" So we went to the game. And we actually had a really good time with our friends. On the drive home that night we talked about how great it was to finally be able to go back to that place and remember my mother with a smile rather than all those feelings of sadness. But shortly after we got home that night Lincoln said he didn't feel well. A few minutes later he collapsed. I had to call for an ambulance. His family met me at the emergency room. We waited for what seemed like forever until finally a doctor came out. But rather than taking us out back to see Lincoln he took us back to a private room and sat us down and explained to us that Lincoln who was the most adventurous person I'd ever met was gone. We didn't know at the time but he'd had a heart attack. He was only 26. He didn't have any history of heart problems. So now I found myself a 26-year-old widow and I didn't have my mom. I thought """"How am I going to get through this/"""" And to describe that as a painful period in my life feels like an understatement. And it was during that time that I realized when you're really going through tough times good habits aren't enough. It only takes one or two small habits to really hold you back. I worked as hard as I could not just to create good habits in my life but to get rid of those small habits no matter how small they might seem. Throughout it all I held out hope that someday life could get better. And eventually it did. Holding out hope A few years down the road I met Steve. And we fell in love. And I got remarried. We sold the house that Lincoln and I had lived in and we bought a new house in a new area and I got a new job. But almost as quickly as I breathed my sigh of relief over that fresh start that I had we got the news that Steve's dad had terminal cancer. And I started to think """"Why do these things always have to keep happening?"""" """"Why do I have to keep losing all my loved ones?"""" """"This isn't fair."""" But if I'd learned anything The list it was that that way of thinking would hold me back. I knew I was going to need as much mental strength as I could muster to get through one more loss. So I sat down and I wrote a list of all the things mentally strong people don't do. And I read over that list. It was a reminder of all of those bad habits that I'd done at one time or another that would keep me stuck. And I kept reading that list over and over. And I really needed it. Because within a few weeks of writing it Steve's dad passed away. Mental strength vs physical strength My journey taught me that the secret to being mentally strong was that you had to give up your bad mental habits. Mental strength is a lot like physical strength. If you wanted to be physically strong you'd need to go to the gym and lift weights. But if you really wanted to see results you'd also have to give up eating junk food. Mental strength is the same. If you want to be mentally strong you need good habits like practicing gratitude. But you also have to give up bad habits like resenting somebody else's success. No matter how often that happens it will hold you back. How to train your brain So how do you train your brain to think differently? How do you give up those bad mental habits that you've carried around with you? It starts by countering those unhealthy beliefs that I talked about with healthier ones. For example unhealthy beliefs about ourselves mostly come about because we're uncomfortable with our feelings. Feeling sad or hurt or angry or scared those things are all uncomfortable. So we go to great lengths to avoid that discomfort. We try to escape it by doing things like hosting a pity party. And although that's a temporary distraction it just prolongs the pain. The only way to get through uncomfortable emotions the only way to deal with them is you have to go through them. To let yourself feel sad and then move on. To gain confidence in your ability to deal with that discomfort. Unhealthy beliefs about others Unhealthy beliefs about others come about because we compare ourselves to other people. We think that they're either above us or below us. Or we think that they can control how we feel. Or that we can control how they behave. Or we blame them for holding us back. But really it's our own choices that do that. You have to accept that you're your own person and other people are separate from you. The only person you should compare yourself to is the person that you were yesterday. And unhealthy beliefs about the world come about because deep down we want the world to be fair. We want to think that if we put in enough good deeds enough good things will happen to us. Or if we tough it out through enough bad times we'll get some sort of reward. Life isnt fair But ultimately you have to accept that life isn't fair. And that can be liberating. Yeah it means you won't necessarily be rewarded for your goodness but it also means no matter how much you've suffered you're not doomed to keep suffering. The world doesn't work that way. Your world is what you make it. But of course before you can change your world you have to believe that you can change it. I once worked with this man who had been diabetic for years. A Diabetic Story His doctor referred him to therapy because he had some bad mental habits that were starting to affect his physical health. His mother had died from complications of diabetes at a young age so he just believed he was doomed and he'd given up trying to manage his blood sugar altogether. In fact his blood sugar had gotten so high lately that it was starting to affect his vision. And he had his driver's license taken away. And his world was shrinking. When he came into my office it was clear he knew all the things he could do to manage his blood sugar. He just didn't think it was worth the effort. Diet Pepsi But eventually he agreed to make one small change. He said """"I'll give up my two liter-a-day Pepsi habit and I'll trade it in for Diet Pepsi."""" And he couldn't believe how quickly his numbers started to improve. And even though he came every week to remind me how horrible Diet Pepsi tasted he stuck with it. And once he started to see a little bit of improvement he said """"Well maybe I could look at some of my other habits."""" He said """"I could trade in my nightly bowl of ice cream for a snack with a little less sugar."""" And then one day he was at a thrift store with some friends and he found this beat-up old exercise bike. He bought it for a couple of bucks and he brought it home and he parked it in front of his TV. And he started to pedal while he'd watch some of his favorite shows every night. Losing Weight And not only did he lose weight but one day he noticed he could see the TV just a little bit more clearly than he had before. And suddenly it occurred to him maybe the damage done to his eyesight wasn't permanent. So he set a new goal for himself-- to get his driver's license back. And from that day forward he was on fire. By the end of our time together he was coming in every week saying """"OK what are we going to do this week?"""" Because he finally believed that he could change his world. One Small Step And that he had the mental strength to change it. And that he could give up his bad mental habits. And it all started with just one small step. So I invite you to consider what bad mental habits are holding you back? What unhealthy beliefs are keeping you from being as mentally strong as you could be? And what is one small step that you could take today? Right here right now. Thank you. "" "
The psychology of self-motivation | Scott Geller | TEDxVirginiaTech,Scott Geller,"Thank you. Thank you. Beyond boundaries. What a theme huh? Now when I think of boundaries I think of rules regulations and restrictions. And I think of the parents and the teachers and the supervisors who hold us accountable with regard to those boundaries. That's not a bad thing. Yeah I know if you're like me I need supervisors I need someone holding me accountable to do the right thing. But beyond boundaries is something different. I think of those leaders those teachers those supervisors those parents who inspire us to go beyond the call of duty to do more than we have to to do it not because they tell us but because we want to. I would like to share with you what the research says about how to make that happen. And not just for other people but for yourself. Here is the deal how could we inspire people and ourselves to be self-motivated? Empowerment There is another word. It's called """"empowerment"""". You've heard that word right? Now the management definition of empowerment is """"Get it done. Just get it done. With fewer resources and less time I empower you make it happen."""" I'm talking about feeling empowered. That's different. Feeling empowered is when you're self-motivated. Now if you want to know if you feel empowered or if your child your student your worker feels empowered ask them three questions. If they say yes to these three questions they will feel empowered. And by the way this is not based on common sense this is based on research. But you've all been there so it'll feel like common sense. Question number one: can you do it? Albert Bandura calls it self-efficacy. Do you believe you can do it? Do you have the time the knowledge and the training to do what we are asking you to do? If you answer yes good. Second question: will it work? Do you believe that what we're asking you to do the process will work? Albert Bandura calls that response-efficacy: believing that the behavior would lead to the ultimate outcome. By the way that takes education. We have to show them the data we might show them some theory we show them teach them why this might work. I just used the word 'education'. Earlier I used the word 'training'. Training Is there a difference? In elementary school we call it education. Middle school: education. High school: education. College: higher education. (Laughter) Then you go to industry what do you call it? Training. You have your training department. There must be a difference. Well you know the difference. Do you want your kids to have sex education or sex training? (Laughter) And your kids might answer the question differently. (Laughter) Because you know that training means you do the behavior and you get feedback. That's powerful. Powerful. Have you ever heard this word 'online training'? It's an oxymoron isn't it? I mean training is to watch the behavior but online training is like plastic silverware jumbo shrimp legal brief country music. (Laughter) I mean it doesn't work. OK so if you answer yes till it will work third question: is it worth it? Consequences So we've had a training question we've had an educational question this is the motivational question. Do you believe the consequences-- This is about the consequences. B.F. Skinner taught us this: """"selection by consequences"""". Dale Carnegie quoted B.F. Skinner and said that from the day you were born everything you did was because you wanted something for doing it. Consequences. Is it worth it? So you have to convince people that it's worth it. Now by the way if you answer yes to those three questions you feel competent am I right? You feel competent at doing worthwhile work. You've all been there. When you feel competent at doing worthwhile work you're more likely to be self-motivated. You've been there. No one has to look over you. Here is the challenge leaders teachers. How do you inspire people to feel competent? Well you give them feedback. You give them recognition. You show them they are competent. OK. I got one more another C word: choice. Choice Your common sense will tell you. When you believe you have a sense of autonomy a sense of choice in what you're doing you feel more self-motivated. B.F. Skinner taught us that too in his book """"Beyond Freedom and Dignity"""" way back in 1971. Reading that book changed my life because I realized that I am controlled by consequences. But sometimes I don't feel controlled. When I'm working for a pleasant consequence it feels good it feels like I'm working to get something. When I'm working to avoid an aversive consequence I feel controlled. That is called negative reinforcement. So here is a challenge leaders: how do we get people to become success seekers rather than failure avoiders? First day of Introductory Psychology class - I teach two classes of 600 students maybe some of you've been in that class and remember - the first day I say """"How many are here to avoid failure?"""" And 80% raise your hand. I say """"Well thanks for coming I know you're motivated but you are not happy campers. You probably told your friends 'I've got to go to class. It's a requirement.' Not 'I get to go to class. It's an opportunity.' You probably woke up to an alarm clock not an opportunity clock."""" (Laughter) It's all in how you see it. Really it's all in how you see it. It's your paradigm. It's how you communicate to others and how you communicate to yourself. Communication So Ellen Langer said in her book """"Mindfulness"""" - and psychologists know - """"When you perceive choice you perceive motivation."""" You're more motivated. So the deal is for yourself sit back and reflect be mindful of the choices you have. And talk about being a success seeker rather than a failure """"avoider"""". It's all how you talk how you communicate to yourself and to others. I got a fourth C word: community. Powerful word. Psychologists know that social support is critical. People who perceive a sense of relatedness a sense of connection with other people feel motivated and they are happier. I want to recite a poem. It's called """"The cookie thief"""" by Valerie Cox. And as I recite this poem - there is only two characters a men and a lady - put yourself in the situation. Be mindful think about the situation and what you would do. OK? Here we go. A woman was waiting at an airport one night With several [long] hours before her flight. She hunted for a book in the airport shop Bought a bag of cookies and found a place to drop. She was engrossed in her book but happened to see That the man beside her as bold as could be [Grabbed] a cookie or two from the bag between Which she tried to ignore to avoid a scene She read munched cookies and watched the clock As this gutsy cookie thief diminished her stock She was getting more irritated as the minutes ticked by Thinking """"If I wasn't so nice I'd blacken his eye."""" With each cookie she took he took one too When only one was left she wondered what he'd do With a smile on his face and a nervous laugh He took the last cookie and he broke it in half (Laughter) He offered her a half as he ate the other She snatched it from him and thought """"Oh brother. This guy has some nerve and heÕs also rude. [Why] he didn't even show any gratitude."""" She had never known when she had been so galled And sighed with relief when her flight was called She gathered her belongings and headed for the gate Refusing to look back at the thieving ingrate She boarded the plane and sank in her seat Then she sought her book which was almost complete As she reached in her baggage she gasped with surprise There was her bag of cookies in front of her eyes (Laughter) """"If mine are here she moaned with despair Independent or Interdependent """"Then the others were his and he tried to share."""" """"Too late to apologize she realized with grief That she was the rude one the ingrate the thief. So where were you when I was-- Where were you? Who's side were you on? Were you thinking independent? Or interdependent? I don't blame you if you think independent. That's how we are raised. Nice guys finish last. Squeaky wheel gets the grease. Gotta blow your own horn. Independent. We come in this life of ours dependent of others and then we can't wait to become teenagers. We are too old to do what kids do. Too young to do what adults do. So that we will do that nobody else would do to assert our independence. And some of us gets stuck there. We are stuck. I'll do it myself. I don't need you. Not good. We need each other. We have to have each other's back. We need a sense of community. This independence culture that we got we have to move to interdependent. OK four """"C"""" words that can fuel self-motivation and I think can fuel actively caring for people. Let me tell you a story to put it all together. Scotts Story It happened over 60 years ago. I remember it like yesterday. My parents asked me """"Hey Scott. How would you like to get drum lessons? How would you like to play the drums?"""" Oh man! Would I ever? I'm thinking of Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa. Most of you guys don't know those names but they were the drummers. In those days the drum was in front of the band. They had White Pearl drum sets and I saw it myself. That was my vision. I had a vision: consequences. That was my vision. And I said """"Yeah I want to take drum lessons."""" So the teacher would bring his drum set next to mine. I didn't have a nice drum like this. My parents bought me a beatable drum at an auction. And they said to me """"If you get better if your teacher tells us you get-- - they are holding me accountable - teacher says you are getting better we will get you a better snare drum and then a bass drum and then some cymbals."""" And that was my vision and that kept me going: consequences. So the teacher would come in and he would show me stuff: this is how-- left hand; this is how Buddy Rich plays with his left hand and his right hand. and then he'd do things like a flam. (Drum) Can you hear that at the back? You OK? And this is a rimshot. (Drum) He would show me stuff. I was just 10 years old remember? And when he showed me stuff I felt """"Wow!"""" He showed me this little simple drumbeat """"Watch me Scott watch this."""" (Drum) And I practiced it. And I did it. I am feeling competent. He showed me a paradiddle """"Listen. (Playing drums) Paradiddle paradiddle."""" """"You go home and practice; next week I want to see your paradiddling. I said """"Watch this."""" (Drumming) And I said """"Watch this."""" (Drumming) He said """"That's a double paradiddle. We didn't get there yet."""" I am really ahead. (Laughter) Because I'm self-motivated. I feel competent. I'm walking through Newberg High School Allentown Pennsylvania. I see the music teacher and he says """"I've heard you're learning to play the drums."""" I said """"Yeah! I'm getting good."""" He said """"You can march in the band. You can be the snare drummer."""" Wow! That felt good. Another vision. Then the teacher comes into my-- - these are private lessons by the way two dollars that was a long time ago - He said """"Scott! Ready to do a drum roll."""" I said """"Of course I'm ready for a drum roll."""" And he says """"Watch this Scott! Here you go. Watch this."""" (Drumming) """"Hmm... could you do that again?"""" """"Scott. This is easy. Watch me."""" (Drumming) """"Now you practice that and next week I want to see your drum roll."""" He comes back the next week and says """"How is your drum?"""" """"Hmm... I can do a paradiddle."""" (Drumming) """"That's regression. Ha-ha. I want to see a drum roll."""" Week after week now we're talking about distress. Now we're talking about apathy. Now we are talking about learned helplessness. That's what psychologists call it. I remember walking through that elementary school and seeing the music teacher who said """"So Scott how are you doing? How are the drums?"""" """"Huh not so good. I can't do a drum roll."""" You know like adults always say """" Never say can't. You can be anything you want to be Scott."""" """"No. I can't do a drum roll. I've tried and I tried and I've kind of given up."""" And he says """"Scott when you ever get overwhelmed break it down."""" Break it down. Can you do a paradiddle?"""" """"Yeah!"""" (Drumming) """"OK what's the second beat?"""" """"Two beats."""" (Drumming) """"Yeah. Well that's a drum roll Geller. It's two beats."""" (Drumming) You go home and practice and you say """"Dad and mama - remember I was just 10 - """"You go 'dad and mama dad and mama'."""" (Drum) It's a drum roll. That teacher came back the next week """"OK Scott. I guess you can't do a drum roll."""" I said """"Watch this."""" (Drumming) He said """"Wow! How did you learn to do that?"""" And I showed my teacher. (Drumming) I taught my teacher. 10 years old. He said """"I've forgotten. I got into the habit of just doing this (Drumming) and I forgot that it is two beats. You taught me how to teach the drum roll Scott. There is a lesson there: we can always learn from each other. We need to have the humility to accept feedback and the courage to speak up. And we need to help each other feel self-motivated. How? Give them the perception of competence. Teach them about 'consequences drive us'. Let them perceive choice and let them know it's community. We're all in this together. And we need each other. Thank you. "" "
Stress And The Brain: JaimeTartar at TEDxNSU,JaimeTartar," so the title of my talk is """"Stress and the brain: the good the bad and the misunderstood."""" Another title that I could have given the talk is """"In defense of stress because we all talk about stress as if it were a bad thing but the point of this series is to inspire you so I'd like to inspire you. Millions of years of evolution have ensured that your stress system does exactly what it's supposed to do. It works perfectly. You're the problem. (Laughter) I'm going to show you why you're the problem. So stress and why it matters. The first thing that we need to do and we're going to have kind of a fun lecture but just get a little bit of biology out of the way quick and dirty. When we have a stressor the first thing that happens is we have a fight or flight response. This happens immediately. There's this part of your brain very deep down the locus coeruleus he's going to tell your adrenal gland """"Ahh! I'm getting eaten by a tiger release epinephrine."""" If you're in Europe you can call it adrenaline it's the same chemical it doesn't matter. You're going to release adrenaline. The sympathetic nervous system does a very good job of doing what we in college like to refer to as the four Fs: fight flight fright and sex. (Laughter) These are the four things that it does. It's going to keep you alive whether you like it or not no conscious choice here. Or keep you alive in the future. This system acts very very quickly. A little bit later on we get this sort of slower acting system. This little part of our brain up here the hypothalamus which is really the CEO of all of the hormones in your body. The hypothalamus is going to say """"Oh my god we're stressed."""" He's going to tell the pituitary gland """"Hey release this other hormone ACTH."""" ACTH is going to fall down and then he is also going to tell the adrenal gland the adrenal cortex the same place that squirts out all that epinephrine he's going to say """"Release cortisol and we've all heard about cortisol. Cortisol makes you fat. Cortisol does horrible things to you. Oh we hate cortisol. But cortisol keeps you alive. If there's a tiger who's going to come eat you cortisol will keep you alive. So the problem isn't cortisol the problem is the dysregulation of cortisol. What cortisol does then is it's going to go back up to all those places who originally released it and it's going to say """"Whoa slow down."""" The major place in our body that binds cortisol is the hippocampus. So you listened to Matt's talk we all know what the hippocampus does right? It's important for? Memory! It's also important for cortisol. And all those cortisol receptors are in the hippocampus and it binds to the hippocampus and it says """"Hey... stop."""" But if you have too much cortisol being released the cells can't handle it and they just die like """"Oh we can't handle it we're going to die."""" And they kill themselves. (Laughter) And then you get more cortisol released you have even less cells to handle it you see what's happening here? And so the HPA the hypothalamicÐpituitaryÐadrenal gland this axis just sort of spurts out of control. OK and this is where some of the problems arise. This can happen acutely or this can happen chronically right? You get stressed this stuff happens to you. You get stressed over and over and over again it's this idea of chronic stress. But it turns out we have 2 different ways of responding to stress. We do have this biological process that occurs the sympathetic nervous system and the HPA axis but then in our brains we're going to respond differently to different types of stress in slightly different ways. And the major way of differentiating those is between physical stress and psychological stress. So the difference between getting eaten by a tiger - there were some real pictures but it wasn't pleasant - (Laughter) or this. OK. Or if you're Ryan Gosling you might be stressed because your picture's all over the Internet these days. (Laughter) OK we all have these kinds of stressors. And as my colleague alluded to earlier it's very stressful not to be able to use copyrighted images so I wanted to give you this [basic--] Oops. What is stress? So stress for us isn't getting eaten by a tiger. Our body is ready to respond to that it's ready to respond to starvation. It's very very well adapted to responding to someone wanting to punch you in the face someone trying to steal your meat. It does a very good job of that but what we've experienced is daily life hassles. That's really our stress. And does this happen acutely or does this happen all the time multiple times a day? I wanted to give you an example and I couldn't use copyrighted images so I'm going to tell you the things that stress me but I imagine that you have some of the same things going on in your life. So the first thing that stresses me are my colleagues. (Laughter) They make me nuts. (Laughter) Except the ones who are here they're wonderful. (Laughter) OK my bosses who are not here tonight make me crazy. So I imagine you have bosses who give you stress too for different reasons. He may look nice. He scares me. (Laughter) This guy used to be a hostage negotiator and now he's my boss. (Laughter) And evidently I'm kind of glad to hear so many of the presenters tonight get stressed by students texting in their class because it's one of the major things that stresses me out because I'm trying to lecture and no one's paying attention to what I'm saying and I think it's very important and I have theory of mind so I'm thinking about what they're talking about and thinking about and texting and I'm not thinking about what I should be thinking about it's awful. It's a whole thing then I start to shake and leave the classroom. So you can imagine looking out at this trying to talk and educate young minds and this is what you see. (Laughter) My husband. (Laughter) We're working on it. (Laughter) My children. They're twins and they're five. It's not that my husband and children are enough to drive me crazy but they have a dog. (Laughter) It's their dog. It's my source of stress. OK so you get the idea. These are probably the same types of things that are happening to all of us every day multiple times a day. So it's not just that it happens to some people and it doesn't happen to other people. Some people are more at risk of succumbing to some of the health consequences of all of these things. So these are the kind of things that are going to put you at risk keeping in mind this is what your stress response system has evolved to do this is what it's really doing right? Dealing with all of these things. So the things that are going to kill you basically is unremitting stress. It turns out it's not just unremitting stress. If you really want to kill somebody you don't want to use pharmacology you don't want to go to jail. The good way to do it is unremitting unpredictable stress. So if I wanted to kill my husband - and I don't he's a wonderful person and a biologist but if I did - if I went in every day and I punched him in the face at 2 pm every day I go and punch him in the face at 2 pm what's going to happen is he going to get really stressed? He might divorce me. Is he going to get really really stressed? No because what's going to happen? He's going to say """"Oh I know she's going to come punch me in the face."""" So what you really want to do is you want to give somebody stress but they don't know it's going to happen and it's never ending that's the good stuff. (Laughter) So one of the worst things you can do for yourself one of the worst careers you can do - and I'm sorry if you do this - is long-term care givers. These guys are in a host of trouble. You never know if Johnny's going to have a good day a bad day you can't control what's happening. This is awful for your health make your aunt do it. Don't be that guy. OK so the inability to adjust to stress. And this is me I'm a high-responder rat. And you know who these people are too. These are the people who just react to everything right? My boss yells at me I freak out. My colleague said """"Oh you were late today and I'm worried about it. Everything gives us increased heart rate very easily. This is not a good way to live your life. (Laughter) The other thing is reactivation to stress and you know who you are and you know who these other people are because they don't leave you alone. These are the people who something happens to them """"My boss yells at me then I go home like """"Oh my god you're not going to believe what my boss did he yelled at me."""" I say the whole thing then I call my ten closest friends and tell them what happened and every time I do this I'm reactivating that same HPA axis. I don't need the tiger to bite me. I can make that stuff happen just by thinking about it. And the last thing is- I guess these would be the psychopaths. So a blunted HPA activation. It's also not good to not respond to stress at all. You need a little bit of stress to respond. So we don't want our HPA axes to get dysregulated. We don't want to die of stress. We want to live healthy lives. So I know you're really depressed right now. (Laughter) So the good news is: because the source of stress for us is in our heads we're making it up. No one's punching us in the face. Nobody's starving us. We're all living long and healthy lives hopefully. All the stress that we have is coming from here. It's processive it's psychological. It's that kind of stress that we're constantly thinking about. So the good news is you won't die from stress maybe if I show you the next few slides. You are in control of your stress. OK so I'm going to give you some human displacement activities. This is what we do for animals in stress labs when we want them not to succumb to stress and as human animals we can do the same things. OK the first thing you could do is psychotherapy. It's a lot of work but it has been demonstrated that psychotherapy does produce genuine real changes in that neuroplasticity in your brain it just takes a long time to do it but if you do it you can get real changes in your brain. Exercise believe it or not. Exercise does a very good job at relieving some of the symptoms of stress. You can read an enlightening book. These are things that have been clinically demonstrated to relieve the consequences of stress. You can have good social support like our nice presenter here Leanne Boucher. You could have good sleep hygiene. This may include - I study sleep too - this may include taking a nap during the day. That's OK you can do that. Or whatever works for you. This is my colleague Jason Gershman who likes to race cars and that's a great way for him to relieve his stress. The other thing that I wanted to talk to you about if those things didn't work for you there's a lot of really cool research right now coming out of one particular lab at the University of Wisconsin at Madison this professor Richard Davidson and some of the things that he's shown in his lab he's actually gotten the Dalai Lama and Tibetan monks to come in and he's looked at their brains. And what he's demonstrated is - and these monks they actually show real differences in their EEGs - so some of the brain waves that we associate with higher processing high mental function seem to be much higher in the monks than they are in controls. And some of the brain regions that we associate with love understanding and empathy the insula and the left pre-frontal cortex seem to be more activated. These monks tend to do compassion meditation but I'm guessing this would work for all forms of meditation. They even trained regular guys like you and me to do meditation and we can show these changes so this is very cool. The hard part is I should tell you that these monks had 10	000 hours of training so it did take a long time. But if you're willing to do it you can just be happy like a monk do some meditating. If that doesn't work for you you can always take Prozac. (Laughter) Better living through chemistry as Dr. Ray said. Whereas going to therapy takes a long time therapy would be the analogy of going to the gym. We all want big muscles. We all want to be healthy. We all want to look great. But if you go to the gym it takes a long time to get big muscles look great and have a great cardiovascular health. If I gave you a pill that could do all of those things... come on. (Laughter) So this sort of does what psychotherapy does. Dr. Ray will tell you if there's consequences to it. So the good news is remember I told you when you have all those super high levels of cortisol it kills those hippocampal cells? Well it turns out - and the dirty secret behind Prozac and Dr. Ray I'm sorry is that we have no idea how it works. No clue. No clue. If I give you Prozac your serotonin levels are going to be pretty high right away but when are you going to start to feel better? This is what the pharmacologists don't want you to know. We don't know how most of this stuff really works. It takes a while to feel better but it turns out one of the mechanisms by which it may be working is increasing new neurons in the hippocampus. You get increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus. So it might be that as cortisol goes up starts to destroy those hippocampal neurons you have fewer hippocampal neurons and you get into the cascade that one researcher calls the glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis when you give somebody Prozac it may increase the amount of neurons and help to restore some of the functioning of the hippocampus. So Prozac does increase neurogenesis in the hippocampus. And if you block neurogenesis in the hippocampus you also block the behavioral effects of Prozac. So that's sort of interesting. It's new research so we'll see where it goes. So I'd say the bottom line today is to keep in mind your stress system is fine it's working properly. It wants to keep you alive. It wants to keep you alive for the next five minutes. It doesn't care if you're going to live to 100. So I would say try to do all of those things. Recognize that you're in control of how stressed you become. And that's all I have for you. Hopefully you have a new beginning. Thank you. "" "
The Power of Being Alone | Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev,Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev ,"He said, It's better to walk alone than to walk with a fool. If you want, consciously you can evolve in this evening. There is no limit as to how a human being can become. This is something that every human being must do. Then, coming together will be hugely rewarding. When Gautama the Buddha was asked, Is it better to walk alone or in company? He said, It's better to walk alone than to walk with a fool. (Laughs) Well, that's him, not me. He was quite sure that only a fool will walk with you. (Laughs) So he said, It's better to walk alone than to walk with a fool. Certain lore in this country says, when you want to do a short and quick journey, walk alone. When you want to do a long journey, walk in company. But the important thing is, who is walking with you? Not always being together is a good thing, many times being together can be a nuisance. So, first and foremost, unless you are a twin, even then, we come alone and we go alone. If one does not know how to be by himself or herself, then being together can be a lot of nuisance. We are referred to as human beings. Human beings means every other creature is what it is simply because of what it does. But a human being can simply be, which is a unique quality of the human being, that we can simply be, that we are not compulsive action, that's what it means. Our action is conscious and judicious but generally, when people get together, generally, people are in compulsive action. It can be an association, where there could be a purposeful action or it can be a gang where there can be more purposeful action or it can be a crowd which can be a compulsive action. So, essentially, to be human means we have reached that point of evolution within ourselves that if we wish, we can simply sit here, just be. We can consider as to what action to take and what not to take. This is definitely individual. When individuals come together, we say its We in plural, but still it is individuals who have to come together. To be an individual means you are not further divisible, that means you are just one. People find different ways to divide themselves within themselves. In India, with a 8-10 thousand years of cultural history, we have invented various words to divide ourselves. It's very common for people to talk in terms of atma, paramatma, ahankara, this one and that one. But every culture has this in their own way. When things are going right, when good things are being done, if you ask people, they say, Yes, I did it. When things don't go right, when things go wrong, then they will try to find somebody, if they don't find anybody, he's always there. (Laughs) When they are very wonderful, of course they take pride in being how wonderful they are. When they turn nasty, they say, It was my ego. Mr. Ego is always a fall guy. So individual means, that if I'm wonderful, it's me; if I'm nasty, it's me. All of you, are you 24 hours wonderful? Hello? Are you 24 hours wonderful? No, no, sometimes wonderful, sometimes nasty, sometimes beautiful, sometimes ugly. It's okay. If we understand it is me who is capable of being absolutely wonderful and it is me who is capable of being absolutely nasty another moment, then gradually the number of moments of nastiness will keep on receding. If I see what is wonderful is me, what is nasty is In India, we have many words, It's my karma. What can I do? No, you must fix this. Being an individual is very important. That means you're not further divisible. If I'm wonderful, it's me. If I'm nasty to me, if I succeed, it's me. If I fail, it's me. You have to fix this. I'm just asking you a simple question  Within this, how many people? Hello? How many people within you? One? Two? Only one. If you're one, youre normal human being. If you're more than one, you're either schizophrenic or you're possessed. You either need a psychiatrist or a exorcist. But you will see whenever things don't go right, another guy will pop up from somewhere. So becoming an individual means you killed all those pop-ups and just said, This is me. This what is me has many dimensions. If I don't see this is an individual, I cannot divide this further, then transformation will not happen. If transformation does not happen, if people come together in that state, there will be more mess than solutions. All creatures hang out together. Whether it is various wild creatures, most of them hang out together. Even monkeys who are just one step behind us, they are also in bunches. It is only human being who can sit alone and transform himself or herself because this is the prerogative of being human that we can simply be. This is why you are called human being. You're capable of being. You are not in a compulsive state of activity. If you want, consciously you can evolve, in this evening you can evolve, if you're willing. It doesn't take a million years because our evolution is not biological anymore, our evolution is conscious. For every other creature, it is fixed. Nature has fixed two lines within which every other creature lives and goes. But once you have come as a human being, there is only bottom line, there is no top line. There is no limit as to how a human being can become. So before we associate ourselves with people, it'll be good every day in the morning or a certain period of your life if one withdraws to spend a little time with oneself and see how, in what ways can this be a little better than the way it was yesterday. This life, how it can be a little better life than what it was yesterday. Because most people are coming together for their needs. To fulfill needs, people come together. Some people come together to fulfill a purpose or a cause. Some people come together to eat, drink and be together because they cannot be alone. This is something that every human being must do. A certain period of time, you do one thing, just 24 hours, take a break from everything. Not today, right now you're among people. You take a break sometime, just 24 hours and don't read, don't watch television, don't use a phone, simply sit in your room, alert, not sleeping. And if you watch the nature of your mind, you yourself will certify This is a madman. Because for most people, their mind cannot stay on any one thing unless they're in activity, simply they cannot be here. In compulsive state of psychological activity is on; when you are like this, you cannot be. That means you cannot be a human being. Being has to happen, only then togetherness will be very rich. If you know how to be by yourself, then coming together will be hugely rewarding and of tremendous value, that means we came together consciously."
TEDxNorrkoping - Peter Grdenfors - How to Motivate Students?,Peter Grdenfors,are you bored that's good you could have said not yet there is an investigation among high school students where they were asked to write down in a few words what they think about schools what their experiences of schools were and it turned out that the most popular answer was school is boring and that leads to two questions the first question is why is this so why did I think that school is so boring and in the first part of my talk I will give a diagnosis of the situation and the second question is that should have to be like that and the answer is no and I will in the second part more constructive part I will give some ideas about how to generate motivation this is a picture from a primary school at the end of the 19th century and as you can see not very much has changed in the general organization of a classroom or the lesson the students sitting at the disks there is a blackboard there is a teacher there are some superficial differences but very much looks the same the organization of schools has actually changed very little over time what you don't see in the picture is there is that there is a set of hidden rules that govern the lecture here and I have written down some of these rules to make them explicit so everybody in the class shall be of roughly the same age they shall do the same thing independently on where they are in their learning development independently of what talents they have they should lose use the same learning tools and in the traditional school the prime tool has been texts textbooks they should follow the same curriculum there is a set program that the teacher wants the students to go through there should be judged in the same way examined in the same way they should all be give the same answer to questions come to think of it this is very funny I mean in school when a question is answered it's supposed that there is unique correct answer to it if you're going out in reality this almost never happens and I should be quiet and sit still unless of course the teacher addresses them and they should concentrate in particular on what the teacher is doing these rules cannot be found in any curricula or any official descriptions that's why I call them hidden they are built into the system and the teachers have to follow them more or less in order to fit into what the school expects out of the teachers if you ask the kids about what they like about the rules they say they don't in particular they don't want to do the same thing as everybody else and why should I is there any reason for this and they don't want to sit still when when my youngest son was starting his first grade I asked him after a couple of weeks what is the main difference between school and and preschool and he answered school makes my bottom hurt and if you ask them about where did I want to concentrate they don't even understand the question and if they do what I want to do they concentrate concentration comes comes automatically there is absolutely no research that supports this rule of these rules of the lessons there is nothing that says that this is the best way of achieving learning they have been established more or less by tradition and they are to some extent motivated by the ideas of industrialism I want to point out two consequences of these rules and the first one is that not everybody the rules have been formulated from the perspective of the schools and there are some some students who have problems here for instance if you have problems with reading texts you have problems in fitting into the traditional lesson here and if you have severe problems you're diagnosed as a dyslexic and you're given special special treatment in the school you sorted out of the ordinary system and in Ken Robinson's TED talk he gave the example of the girl who absolutely could not sit still and she later became one of Britain's most famous dancers and choreographers and she concentrated when she was moving I mean for her sitting still was totally going against her desire on how to behave and how to learn so I recommend school leaders to change the perspective and to focus on the individuals instead you should ask instead of talking about what school says about how you should behave in the class you should ask what how can school adapt to make the situation the best for this particular individual and I think we are very far from from that situation the second consequence and the most important here is that these rules block the motivation of the students now if you go outside schools kids are not bored at all they do what I like to do and young children are most motivated when they are playing and somehow there has been a division between playing and learning playing is for fun learning is something serious so you cannot definitely not learn by by playing this reminds me of the old saying that when you take a medicine it should taste bad otherwise it doesn't work and the analogy is of course that teaching must be boring otherwise it doesn't work I found it difficult to see the logic of this argument it's not the teachers fault that school blocks motivation I mean it's these rules are built into the system as a matter of fact the teachers have to work against the rules I mean if you're a good teacher you still succeed in generating motivation in your students if you're not so good you're your you will fail the students will be still be bored and you will lose your own motivation as a teacher so the question is then how should we restructure schools to make students more motivated I wish I had a general answer to this question but I don't but I think I've identified a few factors that are useful in in generating motivation in students so let's turn to these factors I have bored some idea from Jerome Bruner who is a psychologist and educationalist and he identifies three factors the first one is quite natural that you should build on the curiosity of the students we as human beings are born with a very strong natural current curiosity I think I could say that along with the rats we are the most curious animals on this on this planet so that's criterion is quite natural the second one is maybe a bit surprising he says that having a feeling of having a control over a situation being competent it is a very strong factor for for for motivation I mean if you solve the problem that you that you had struggled with and then suddenly you feel a sense of relief and this is very motivating for you and I will come back to this point that having control it's a very strong source of motivation the third factor is that we are after all social animals we would like to do things together and if we can collaborate among people we like then this also increases cooperation when I read about these three criteria I was thinking about I was trying to find some systems where these criteria or well fulfilled and I found two examples the first example is video games video games built very clearly on the curiosity of the player they build up virtual worlds that are interesting that are fascinating the players want to go around the corner and see what happens in the next scene and so on so these screens are made for for curiosity of course when coming to the second factor a player cannot have full control over the game then it would be boring there is some challenge there is a mission that you have to fulfill and computer games are very often built up in a series of levels the first level is quite easy you can solve it after a few attempts then you feel some kind of service satisfaction you bounce on the go on to the next level and you try again on after a while you succeed and you're building up a sense of how it getting more and more control having more and more competence in this game and even if a game is a one player game they in particular children very often play a game together with somebody else one is playing the game there is somebody else sitting next and looking at what's going on there talk about the game they have an interesting chat about but of course the most motivating games are those where you play together with somebody else in particularly when you play in a team against some other team that's a very motivating situation so the computer game industry has been very successful in catching the motivation of the players and we we see the consequences of of that in the lives of ourselves and of our of our children the second system that fulfills these criteria quite well is what call is called peeler again and if you look at where what children do outside school they're very often engaged in impaired learning they meet their friends they go skateboarding and I go riding horses they play tennis they we play in in the GarageBand and so on and they are very often driven by an interest in the topic very curious about what they are doing what whatever the topic is and in the group in the peer group there are some who are good and some are not so good and the ones who are the experts in the area they get the very high status in the group then they have a feeling of competence and they are motivated and very often they are willing to help the the children in the group who are not so good to teach them about how to solve a particular problem who to do how to do this trick and or how to play this chord on the guitar oh or whatever is in is going on here so it's very much based on getting more and more control over over an area and more or less by definition peer learning is a cooperative game so peer learning is a system that works very well as a motivating system and I think I can recommend teachers and school leaders to introduce more aspects of peer learning in the schools I think that would be one way of increasing the motivation of of the students and the next factor is understanding when you get an AHA experience you get a kind of feeling of relief when you have struggled with a problem we haven't haven't seen the solution you are stressed and and when you suddenly see the solution you have a feeling of relief and this is very motivating and this motivating thing makes you want to go on and learn more try to understand more so the question is why what is going on here well I think that one factor is that when you understand something you feel that you're able to solve new problems you can see the pattern you can know what to do next and so on and that gives you a feeling of competence that gives you a feeling of control so the mechanism I want to point out here is that understanding generate control and as we saw earlier control is something that is motivating so there is an indirect link here but it's also very important to point out the other direction if you don't understand you become very frustrated and if you're frustrated your motivation goes down very very quickly and therefore in a schooling situation it's very important that the teacher can understand can see whether a student understands what's going on in the classroom or not and help the student to to go on ok one more factor is I can borrow from hatha John Hattie's book on visible learning and John Hattie he has done a Herculean task of investigating in a large number of studies of educational interventions I mean he's gone through more than 800 meta-analysis of a lot of studies and they're actually based on more than 50000 individual studies of educational interventions and in total more than 200 million students are involved in this so it has been really really a big task and what he finds he looks at a large number of factors more than 100 factors of different aspects of school I mean the organization of school with lirik ation of teachers and individual features and so on and one thing he finds is that factors concerning school structure that is how big the classes are very located and so on have indeed a very small effect on the outcomes and he's trying to measure the outcome of each of the factors what he finds is that among the most important factors is the feedback that the teacher gives to the student that turns out to be I mean of course there are factors that the teacher cannot control but among the factors that are with what the teachers can do the feedback to the students is the one that has the greatest effect effect on the education outcomes and let's see how Hattie defines feedback this is his definition feedback consists in providing information how and why the student understands and misunderstands and what the directions to money the student must take to improve so again this is connected to helping the students to understand and then we get yet another element in the link here the final factor I want to introduce is metacognition and metacognition concerns how you reflect power upon your own thinking and your own learning I can maybe think that I'm good at reading text but I'm not so good at using my body and solving problems well I can say that I'm good at drawing but I have problems with briefly reading texts or I can think about what have what have I learned in school last week or I can think about why did it teacher present the material in this or that way when I'm reflecting upon my my own learning process so to speak and it turns out that introducing this kind of reflection will support learning learning results will be better if you introduce this metacognition in the in the classroom if you give the students information about what all the teaching goals and so on and there and they can reflect on whether they like it or not and so on we don't really know why metacognition supports learning but my diagnosis here is that metacognition is part of generating the control over the situation you feel you know that what way you're going in school and why you're doing something so that is one factor that gives you some kind of control over your learning and thereby you you again generate motivation if I go back to John Hattie's book he calls it visible learning and he he says that visible learning is teachers see learning through the ice of the students and then the students looking at the teacher and trying to find out what what is what is going on here and I hope you see that this is one kind of metacognition teachers reflecting upon the students learning and vice versa so again I see a connection between the factors that each have to point out and the factors I have identified as a model here so this is my final diagram where I present all the links that lead to motivation and as you can see there are many roads to motivation thank you very much  
How to talk to the worst parts of yourself | Karen Faith | TEDxKC,Karen Faith,"It isnt true what they say, that you cant love anyone until you love yourself. Have you heard that? People say you have to learn to love yourself before you can love anybody else. But its not true. I loved everybody before I loved myself. Love doesnt care which way you come or what state youre in when you get here. Love welcomes everyone unconditionally. Oddly, so do focus group moderators - (Laughter) which is how and why I learned to do it. If youve never been a part of a focus group, youre missing a really special cultural experience. So, in every focus group, theres a range of characters, right? Theres always a shy one and a chatty one, a grumpy one that doesnt want to do any of the exercises, and a very excited mom with a notebook, who wants to get an A plus in all of the exercises. (Laughter) Theres a student who lied on the intake because they need the money, and a dad full of jokes who cant read the room. (Laughter) And usually, theres one ex-military guy who keeps staring at the two-way mirror suspiciously. (Laughter) Its a situation where a group of people that may not otherwise ever meet have the chance to share their perspectives. And its my job as the moderator to make sure that they all get heard. Now, its not quite a classroom. Its not group therapy. And while the community feel has some elements of holiness, probably no one would call it a spiritual experience. I mean, no one else. Because moderating rooms of strange and difficult voices is what taught me to welcome all the strange and difficult parts of myself. No kidding. I start every morning meditation with the same opener I use as a focus group moderator: Thanks, everyone, for being here. (Laughter) Your input is valued. (Laughter) Im going to hear from each of you. Ill give you all the chance to speak. Just do your best to be completely present, honest, and try to make any requests reasonable. So I dont know about you, but there are a lot of me in here, in the mind of Karen Faith. Im not referring to psychiatric illness specifically, but I dont exclude that. (Laughter) My mind has plenty of quirks, but what I have to share is for anyone with an inner dialogue. Though I admit, its especially for those of us with a really noisy one. So I noticed some time ago that I was arguing with myself. And then I wondered: If I didnt agree with me, who is I, and who is me in that scenario? And it turned out that there are quite a few of me. Theres a really sentimental, emotional me, an intellectual, analytical me. Those two argue a lot. Theres a me who loves being on stage. Theres another one who is pretty shaky at the moment. Some of us - at this time, I include you - some of us regard these as feelings or thoughts. And maybe weve done our personal homework, accepting that we can have conflicting feelings at the same time. We can be excited about a new job and also dread going back to work. We can be tired and want to stay up. We can adore someone who also annoys us. We can love someone who has badly betrayed us. We know this. And when were honest and rational, we can see that these are common experiences. But were not crazy to both love and hate camping. (Laughter) It does me no harm to embrace that I feel both ways about it. But what about the thought that Im worthless, that I dont belong here? The mistakes Ive made are unforgivable, that the bad things that happened in my life were my fault. Those thoughts are just as real as the rest of them, but they're harder to live with. And they send many of us to therapy or to yoga or the nearest bar, which more or less describes my daily commute for many years. (Laughter) Because I wanted to silence those thoughts completely. And let me tell you: I tried. I have done every kind of therapy I have ever heard of. I have done talk therapy, energy healing, body work, hypnotherapy, soul retrieval, the tapping stuff, the thing with the lights. I did seven kinds of yoga. I drank the special tea with the shaman in the forest. (Laughter) I admit I did pass on the acupuncture they do with live honeybees - (Laughter) people do that. (Laughter) Suffice to say, I tried. And still sometimes, when I was alone, I would hear myself shouting: Shut up! or worse to my own mind. In my work as a people researcher, its my job to practice empathy with strangers, to receive everything I can about their world in order to understand them as deeply as possible. Now, its noteworthy that I found this career at a temp job, writing meeting notes, when my supervisor noticed that I wasnt just paraphrasing conversation, I was recording body language, micro-expressions, tonal shifts, specific verb choices. What neither of us knew then is that the qualities which made me seem skillful were the symptoms of complex post-traumatic stress. The most reasonable results of an appalling upbringing, and a fact I share not to set me apart from you but to welcome you in here with me. Everyone in this room has walked through something difficult in order to be here. And I want you to know that whatever path youve taken to get through it is honorable. Whether you never talk about it, or you write bad poetry about it, whether you make tons of money prosecuting it, or if you just hit the gym like a champ to sweat it out of your body, there is truly no wrong way. There are some ways that cause other problems. You know the ones. (Laughter) Ive done some of those. I still do some of those. And I dont judge those either, because gifts and curses are buy one, get one. And mine were no exception. My early life gave me heaps of shame and a splintered sense of self - hence all the different mes - but it also gave me super antennas for the emotions of others. This hypervigilance made me a certified mess of a person but a damn near-wizard-level observer. So I got to work. The last 20 years Ive shadowed people in their homes, at their jobs, while they shop and drive, and go on dates. I ask them to be honest and vulnerable with me, and to do this, I practice something that I call unconditional welcome, which is like a researchers neutrality, but a little extra. The day I discovered it, I was sitting in the living room of a research subject. She was a very unpleasant woman, if Im honest. Feeding french fries to an infant, as she snapped at me that she would never have her children vaccinated, not even to protect them from polio because she didnt know it was in those shots. Now never mind that she said this an inch of ash deep into a Virginia Slim, right. (Laughter) I was judging her, I know. Im not proud of it, but at least one of me is a jerk. (Laughter) I needed to connect with her, and I didnt want to. I didn't like her. I didn't respect her. I didnt want to spend a single moment with her. And the project required that I spend hours. And that I used that time to get to know her: what she values, what she believes, where she finds strength. Researcher neutrality was unavailable to me at the time, so I had to get out the big guns. I called up my New Age visualization skills, and I took a deep breath, secondhand smoke and all. And I imagined that my breath was inflating a shiny soap bubble filled with unconditional welcome. Not tolerance. Not even compassion. Total welcome as is - no comments, no notes. And as I inflated the bubble, it became big enough to contain my whole body. And then hers. And in that moment, I saw a mother feeding her baby in a world that she didnt trust. I told her that I could see that she cared about protecting her son, and I asked her if she got that from her parents. And then we had a conversation. And I learned about her. I learned why she was afraid and angry, and how she fought through that fear to make a family. When I welcomed this woman unconditionally, I saw her more clearly, but I also loved her instantly. We have been told too often that love is hard. Its not. Love is what happens when we stop trying to figure out who deserves it. Its right there when we stop trying to figure out who deserves it, and we welcome someone, anyone, exactly as they are, in the moment. Itll be two more years before I learn to do this with all the parts of myself. But it started just as simply; a part of me had become very chatty - a part that was afraid and angry, whiny, demanding, unreasonable and relentless. She told me that we were never going to get better. She wanted out of here. I asked her what I could do. She only told me she wanted to die, over and over and over and over. I begged her to shut up, and she did not. Finally, after weeks of harassment, whether out of exhaustion or epiphany, instead of shouting back, I took a deep breath. I became my own moderator. I said out loud in a voice that surprised me: Thank you for sharing. Im going to remind you of our agreement to be honest and reasonable. And she answered me - that voice. Now, dont get spooked. This is all just thinking happening. (Laughter) But the part of me asking and the part answering did in fact seem like different parts. She told me that she was in a lot of pain. And I told her: I know. And I promise you Im going to take care of you. But I need you to get on board. I will listen to you, but I will not obey you. And as clearly as Im speaking to you now, she said okay. And then we started to talk. As I continue the dialogue with myself, I found more of me, more voices with more points of view, some of them more fun than others. And the imagined landscape of my mind began to look a lot like a focus group. This round table of wildly mixed characters and one moderator keeping some kind of order with honesty, boundaries, kindness, and most importantly, gratitude. I thank my selves for their contributions. No matter how bonkers or twisted they may seem, because were all me. I think of my fragmented self less like broken mirror and more like a prism. Were full spectrum. Today, there isnt a voice in my head that I dont welcome. And while some of us are occasionally unreasonable, were not mean. Even my whiny, shamey voice is trying to help in her weird way. But when I ask her to be clear and kind, she tells me exactly what I need to know: what she needs to feel better and what shed like for me to learn. But just like the scared and angry mother, she only does this when I accept her exactly as she is in the moment. So while my openings for self-talk and focus groups sound almost identical, the closings are a little different. At the round table, I would hand out parking validation, remind everyone to sign for their cash, but when Im with all of me, I say: I love you. Thank you for helping me see what you see - which is why this practice is so useful for all of us here with our different perspectives, inside and outside of one another. If we can receive one another with the curiosity and welcome of a focus group moderator, perhaps we can do a better job of love. Because it is not true what they say: that you cant love anyone until you love yourself. Love is a house you can crawl in through a window. If you cant start with yourself, start with the person next to you right now whether you know them or not. All you have to do is let them be here. It's easy, isn't it? Wherever theyve been, whatever theyre carrying, whatever talents they have or dont have, whatever mistakes theyve made, can you just welcome them here? Can you welcome you? Were here right now, like this. Were beautiful and strange and complicated and scared and sometimes kind of horrible. But all of us are worthy of welcome. And everyone that you show unconditional welcome may show you a part of yourself to love. You are welcome. Thank you."
Don't Believe Everything You Think | Lauren Weinstein | TEDxPaloAlto,Lauren Weinstein,"This elephant has incredible strength. She can uproot a tree with her trunk alone. Yet she will remain in captivity held by only a light rope. Despite her ability to easily break away she doesn't even try. Why? It starts when she is young. She is first tied down when she is small and not yet strong enough to break the rope. She'll try at first try as hard as she can to break free and try and try but eventually realize she can't. Suddenly something attaches itself to her that is stronger than any rope or chain or fence. It's the belief that she can't break free. It's this belief that holds her back - despite her ability. I've had these same beliefs - you may have too - beliefs that held me back beliefs that led me to feel unfulfilled in my work to struggle in my relationships and to live a life that was far from the one I am living now. It was only when I became aware of my ropes and actively pulled against them that I found myself in a different reality. How do you break the ropes that tie you down? Don't believe everything you think. When I was six years old I had a favorite baby sitter Amber. One morning my mother told me we couldn't have her babysit because she didn't have enough money to pay her. So that afternoon I started my first company. I gathered rocks from around the neighborhood painted them with my art set and went door to door selling them to our neighbors. That night it was Amber and I on the couch together. When I was young I was bold outgoing and fearless. I wore what I wanted (Laughter) or didn't want to wear (Laughter) guided by my own voice that told me what would make me happy. I was also in love. His name was Fernando and he was wonderful. As with everything else I wasn't afraid to grab him with both hands. (Laughter) As I grew older this picture started to fade. My exuberance was replaced with timidness my leadership with conformity my boldness with fear. I don't think any of us leave childhood without some ropes despite our parents' best intentions. I grew up with a mother who was determined to give me the perfect life. Armed with love and good intentions she did everything for me to help me be perfect. I'd pack a suitcase to go on a school trip and she'd unpack it and repack it in a more perfect way. I'd be ready to turn in a school art project and then she'd add her own brush strokes to make it better. Later she told me when my choice of boyfriend or apartment wasn't good enough. Although she just wanted what was best for me I stopped knowing what was best for me. An unconscious rope was formed. I shouldn't trust my own voice and my own ability and I feared not being perfect. Other ropes attached themselves too. I grew up in a family filled with yelling loud voices and strong opinions. To keep the peace I learned to stay quiet to not rock the boat to become invisible. In school I came to believe it's more important to blend in than stand out. And the pain of an early heartbreak led me to hold back in my relationships so I could avoid getting hurt. I'm not good enough. Don't speak up. Don't stand out. Fear failure. These were my ropes. This isn't just my story. Like the elephant we all come to believe certain things in childhood that weren't true - or at least are no longer true. But we still live with them as if they are. If you've ever felt not good enough alone unwanted unloved invisible powerless like you don't belong - these are your ropes. If you've ever felt you can't trust yourself trust others speak up stand out ask for help let others in be accepted as you are - these are your ropes. These ropes hold us back. I found myself defaulting to others' opinions when I should have been trusting my own staying quiet when it would have benefited me to speak up and blending in when I would have been happier if I had to courage to stand out. This led me into a series of jobs that ranged from tolerable to miserable. In one I hoped I'd get sick so I could stay home from work. It led me into a series of relationships in which I lacked confidence in myself the other person and the relationship. These never worked out. My beliefs affected the way I perceived the world which changed how I acted which led to a self-fulfilling prophecy. I felt small and my world became smaller. What we believe has powerful effects. Decades of social psychology research backs this up. In a study performed at Dartmouth College an ugly scar was placed on participants' faces with makeup. They were then sent into a room for a conversation and asked to report how people responded to them with this ugly scar. But here is the twist. Right before they left the experimenter said """"Hold on a minute! We just want to touch up your scar a bit."""" Rather than touch it up they removed it entirely. So unbeknownst to them the participants went into their conversations looking completely normal. Despite this they came back and reported how awkward their conversations were how people avoided looking at their scar had trouble making eye contact and were tense and uncomfortable in the conversation. Their beliefs about their scar led them to see things that weren't really there and to make meaning of innocent behavior. What could have been a perfectly normal conversation instead became an awkward one. Their beliefs created their reality. Other studies show the same effect. Highlight an Asian woman's Asian identity before a math test she'll perform better. Highlight her female identity she'll perform worse. Lead a group of men to believe an athletic task is diagnostic of sports intelligence white men perform better. Lead them to believe it'd diagnostic of natural athletic ability black men do. Give someone a white coat and tell them it's a doctor's lab coat they'll perform better on an attention task than when told it's a painter's coat. In all of these cases same people same abilities same tasks - different beliefs. And in each case it was their belief that raised or lowered their performance. How you see yourself and your circumstances will affect what you see how you act and what occurs as a result. It's almost as if our beliefs place a virtual reality headset on us (Laughter) a headset that allows us to see things that aren't really there and sends us into a false reality. We have these headsets even when they're miles from the truth. I remember hearing the top model Cameron Russell share how models despite having the shiniest hair and the longest legs are some of the most physically insecure people on the planet. And award-winning author Lidia Yuknavitch shared how she didn't follow up on the literary representation she was offered early in her career. The reason in her words: """"We don't always know how to hope or say yes or choose the big thing even when it's right in front of us. It's the shame we carry. The shame of not believing we deserve it."""" Our headsets have us living into a false reality. They also cause us to bump into each other. Once I'd been dating someone for a few weeks. We'll call him Ben. We talked every day. Then he went on a work trip. For four days silence. I didn't hear a word. How would you interpret this? What's the first thought that pops in your head? My beliefs led me to wonder what I had done or said to make this once enthusiastic person change his mind about me. I shared his silence with friends. One who admits she has trouble trusting people was sure he was on this trip with another woman. (Laughter) Another who admits she's afraid of rejection guessed he was probably upset because I hadn't invited him as my date to an upcoming wedding. And a third who has trouble with commitment guessed he probably thought we were moving too fast and was taking some space. Each person saw the same situation through the lens of their own headset. Who was right? How should I respond? Each of these assumptions leads to a different response. Moving too fast? - I should pull back. But if he's feeling rejected this would just hurt him more. Feeling rejected? - I should up my calls and invite him to the wedding. But if he thinks we're moving too fast this will just push him away further. I was so confused. As I was ping-ponging around in my own headset while briefly borrowing some of my friends' headsets this relationship died a slow death. Are you ready for what was going on in Ben's headset? He'd been deeply hurt by a past relationship was afraid of getting hurt again and pulled away when his insecurities got the best of him. It was none of the things anyone had guessed. Sometimes our headsets get in the way of our relationships. It took me a long time to learn this. Just as our beliefs can hold us back they can also propel us forward. Let's go back to the scar study for a moment. Imagine the opposite. Imagine the researchers place something on the participants' faces that leads them to believe they look beautiful and then remove it before they go into the social setting. Now what do you think they believe about others' responses? How do you think they show up differently? What difference does it make if you believe you're ugly or gorgeous good at math or terrible at it good at sports or not? It seems a big one. I finally learned this lesson. My headset led me to law school. There my long-held false beliefs were reinforced: aim for perfection follow the crowd fear failure. This was a familiar path. Then one day without thinking much about it I signed up for a class outside the law school called Design Thinking Boot Camp a class that promised to unleash my creative potential. I had to design innovative products and experiences or more accurately pull on almost every single one of my ropes. I had to trust my own voice because when it comes to innovation there is by definition no one to look to for the answers. I had to put myself out there because innovation doesn't come from playing it safe. And perhaps most importantly I had to be willing to fail to be willing to not be perfect. The best designs came only after multiple failed attempts. If I wanted to get it right I first had to be willing to get it wrong. I struggled in this class because all of the things that would help me succeed were the same things I believed for so many years I shouldn't do. I finally gave in to their crazy approach and the most amazing thing happened. I was free to go play try things experiment - to live as I had before my ropes. I felt free in a way I hadn't since I was six years old and I accomplished things I never would have imagined possible. I was astounded proud liberated - and confused. I wondered if the beliefs that held me back in this class were the same ones holding me back in other parts of my life. The seed had been planted. Maybe I shouldn't believe everything I think. Headset off. To take it off I just had to realize I had it on. Ropes broken. New beliefs lead to new actions. In my first bold move since I was six I turned down my offer to work at a law firm and placed myself in a different reality. I experimented with different jobs and took on various side projects saying yes to ones I previously would have said no to due to lack of experience trusting I could figure it out. I was still afraid of failure and taking wrong turns and sometimes I did. I just no longer let this stop me. Then one day I took on a 10-week part-time position coaching speakers. I fell in love with this work. We're talking Fernando-level love. (Laughter) No longer afraid to grab things with both hands I went on to start my own company helping leaders become more powerful speakers and to teach a communication class at Stanford. Particularly meaningful for me is that I now get to give others what I'd lost for so long - a more powerful voice. I broke other ropes too. When I was self-conscious and shy I never could have imagined revealing my insecurities to you on a TED stage. (Laughter) That would have sounded more like a bad dream. Yet somehow here I am. This process didn't happen overnight. Each new thought each new action built on the one before it until I found myself in a new reality. I still have ropes I'm working to break. My goal is fewer over time. To get there I remind myself of the marshmallow challenge. Teams of four are given 20 sticks of spaghetti a yard of string a yard of tape and a marshmallow. The winning team is the one that can build the tallest freestanding tower they can in 18 minutes. The marshmallow has to be on top. This challenge has been given all over the world to business-school students lawyers CEOs CTOs engineers. Who do you think are among the top performers? Recent graduates of kindergarten. (Laughter) Here's why. The other groups will take what they think they know what they think is the single right answer and end up executing in the wrong direction. In contrast kindergarteners stay open to multiple possibilities. They test out different options they gather information by experimenting until they find the best way forward. They have fun. What makes us so amazing as children is we live in a world before ropes. In a world before """"what's known when there is """"what's possible."""" In a world before """"I can't when there is """"how could I?"""" In a world before falling and staying down when we fall and get right back up again - undeterred. In a world in which nothing is holding us back from our full capacity. What the design class was for me I hope this talk is for you - a seed that gets you to question what you've previously accepted as true that makes you more aware of your ropes that helps you see they were always yours to break. No matter who you are or where you are in this moment there is the life that you can be living if you break your ropes. You get there one new thought at a time one new action at a time until one day you find yourself in a new reality. Thank you. "" "
Love others to love yourself,Keiichiro Hirano,"as i have been recently hearing about disturbing sad news, i often think about the idea of loving yourself. we have been taught to love other people as an important value, but i think loving our own selves hasn't been considered to be an issue worth talking about. why? it may be because it's too obvious, that we love ourselves, to take up the issue and stress the importance. all of us can't avoid being egoistic, sometimes. we want to have things our own way. if everything in our life is going well, can we love ourselves? not necessarily so. the reason why it's hard to discuss 'self-love' may be that it has a kind of a narcissistic whiff and sounds a little icky to people. if we saw somebody looking in the mirror, saying, 'how i love myself! don't bother me!'... i am not talking about myself! we would want to say, 'suit yourself! keep looking in the mirror.' i want to say it doesn't have to be like that, to love ourselves. life isn't always easy. it would be, of course, nice if we were happy all our life. but in our life, many people might say, 'i hate you,' or 'i wish you would disappear from this world.' going through the agony, we ultimately reach the realization that we have to love ourselves in the sense of taking responsibility for ourselves and looking after ourselves. if, when people tell us, 'i hate you,' we respond to it by saying, 'yes, i hate myself, too,' the moment we said so, i'm sure we would lose our desire to go on living. i've felt the need for that kind of attitude more than once myself. since we don't know what will happen in the future, the kind of situation in which we have to love ourselves might arise again, in the sense of needing to take care of ourselves. it would be wonderful if you could live a trouble-free life. for a quite long time, i couldn't figure out what kind of person i was. when i did something good for others, people showed appreciation to me, and then i thought i was basically a pretty good person. like that, i had occasions that made me feel relieved. on the other hand, when i would really hurt someone, i was very disappointed in myself, feeling like i was fundamentally a cruel person. to love ourselves actually may be harder than to love any other person, because we know ourselves thoroughly, through and through. looking back at all we have done in the past, and remembering: 'boy, i did such things as this and that...' and not only the good things we've done, but unpleasant things we've done also come back at us. can we love ourselves with knowing all those sides of us? at this point, i thought, in our thought process, there must be something fundamentally wrong. then, i started by doing this to change it: first, i honestly looked back at myself, seeing a pretty good person, or one not so good. and for the time being, i accepted all my 'selves,' good or bad. instead of being judgmental about myself, thinking 'i may be a nice guy at heart,' or 'i may be basically a cruel person,' 'which one is really me?' i decided to accept all my 'selves' as parts of myself, and thought about why i had so many varied 'selves' in this one person. to sum it up, it's in response to different people and different situations. when i talk to my grandmother, i am very relaxed. when i talk to people at work, i may sound serious, putting on a serious look, talking about difficult things. when i talk to somebody who rubs me the wrong way, you can bet the tone of my voice can't be this calm. i try not to come into contact with such a person in the first place. in any case, each 'self' of mine has its own uniqueness. to love each 'self' of mine equally in order to love myself may be very difficult, but i can say, 'i love my 'self' when i am with this person. i become somebody whom i even abhor when i am with that person. but i like my 'self' pretty well when i am with this particular person. i am not too bad.' in fact, to love ourselves may not be that hard after all. take romance. suppose there are two girls, and i have feelings toward both of them. one day i have a date with one of them, and have dinner with her. i enjoy being with her, talking a lot, frequently interjecting jokes, smiling at each other, and we interact with each other very well. then suddenly i notice it's the time for the last train. i rush to the train station to catch the last one. and at home, i'm happy with myself. as for the other girl, i also like her, but during our date, i can't talk or joke that much... and we often get awkward silences. i feel like a miserable loser. i don't feel like going on with her, so after having dinner, we say goodbye to each other. after the two dates, if i were asked which one i would rather see again, i would choose the first one without hesitation. there's no doubt i like her, but rather because i like my 'self' when i am with her. i enjoy my 'self' when i am with her, and find life worth living in the life of that 'self' of mine. the definition of 'love' may be to love somebody else, this surely is not wrong, but what i would like to add to it is: rather, to love means, with the help of the person we love, for us to be able to love ourselves. that's what i'd like to think. 'i can reveal my inner self as i wish without any difficulties, being true to myself, when i am with that person, and it will never happen with anybody else.' unfortunately, some of our relationships come to end. some end out of disputes. others end due to death. when we grieve over losing our loved ones, we miss the voice and hug of the person, and many other things, but i wonder if we may rather be grieving over losing the life of our 'self' who lived with that person, thinking: 'only with them could i talk freely like that. only with them could i be honest with myself. only with them could i be silly like that. but that person is gone now, and i can't live the life of that 'self' of mine i love any longer.' i wonder if that is what we really grieve over. and, of course, vice versa. if somebody says to me, 'i love you,' i will be euphoric, yelling, 'yes!' but if i were told, 'thanks to you, i come to love myself,' or 'i love myself when i'm with you more than when i am with anybody else,' that would be something which strikes my heart more. that my existence validates one person's existence that way moves me with a deep joy, something poignant. each time when we find one 'self' we love, we may be finding our foothold we need to go on living. in our life, we feel like we need to be loved by many people, a certain percentage of people in our groups, in our class, our workplace. but not that many of those 'selves' we love may be necessary. if we find two or three of our 'selves' we love in ourselves, we can go on with those as our foothold. five or six may be more than enough. you may think you only have 3 friends in your class at school or you may think three that many friends who help you like yourself. all depends on how you take it. to love ourselves doesn't mean saying: 'i am crazy about myself,' looking into a mirror, but, instead, it means, with the help of or via somebody else, for us to come to love ourselves. it's probably where we start really loving ourselves. and that is why, as we feel the need, we love others as indispensable individuals. that's all i want to say. thank you."
On croit qu'on a des problèmes... - TEDxVaugirardRoad,François Le Doze,"i have a problem. how many times do we say that? and we tend to think that it is because we have problems, that we struggle in life. it is not true. if we struggle in life, it is because we have parts within ourselves, parts who are suffering, parts who are afraid, and most importantly, who believe nothing can be changed. this is the reason why we struggle. up until a few months ago, i thought i had a problem which was that i found it hard to speak about me in public. on a personal level. but i did ok, because as a doctor, most often it was related to medical or scientific topics. and as a result, there was no discomfort. until the day i received a call from someone who means a great deal to me and who invited me to talk about my experience on the use of the psychotherapy model which i am introducing to you tonight, and that i use at my hospital. but he did ask specifically for me to make it personal since it was my experience. and i quickly declined his invitation, because there was a little voice inside my head, telling me, ""you have nothing of interest to say."" well, i thought i was at peace with that. but then, few weeks or months later, that same person calls me up again, and again, asks for me to present. at that time i thought, there most certainly was something to unravel here because if this person who means a lot to me, asks again for me to come and talk about my experience, there is something unfinished about this. at first, i asked him to give me a little time, told him that i needed to think it through, and i used this time to look inwards. to look inwards, to know who was telling me that i had nothing interesting to say to other people. on a personal level. to do so, it is important to take a moment. here is how i did it. i focused inwards, on this voice. calmly, and in a curious manner. ""who is it?"" at first, all i heard was this message, ""you have nothing of interest to say."" and then, as i kept asking, i heard something else, ""if this person really knew you, he wouldn't ask you to do that. he really has no idea who you are, you have nothing interesting to say."" it went on for a while. after a while, i realized that this voice came from a person, a part of me. and that this person had all the traits of a critic, a judge from within. this was an important discovery because, i could really become aware of the presence of this person. and as a result, i could genuinely talk with him. ask him questions such as, ""why do you keep on telling me all this? why do you have this purpose in my life to criticize me, to judge me the way you do? what are you afraid of, if i did accept the invitation and went to the conference to talk about myself?"" it was really interesting because all of a sudden, the tone changed, and instead of criticism, came something quite moving, deep inside. ""i'm afraid that you may relive something hard you have experienced before."" so first i thanked this part for his caring intention, and i then asked it, ""now, would you agree to step aside and to let me reconnect with this hardship you want to prevent me from reliving?"" he agreed to that. and behind this part of me was another part. a little boy, eight years of age. he was standing by the door of the apartment i used to live in at the time. he was standing, absolutely frozen. and he did not know i was there. because for all these years, the critic was standing between the two of us. and so it took a little time, for this little boy to realize that i was there, and that i was there for him. and so we started talking, open heartedly. i asked him if he would want to tell me about himself, his story, why he was frozen. we took a moment and talked about his suffering, his emotions. once he turned to me, and recognized me and trusted me enough, he started explaining to me telling me things, things i already knew. but he said them again from deep inside his heart, told me that he was the youngest of a family who was going through a hard time then, with many urgencies to deal with. and that whenever this little boy wanted to talk about himself there was no room, no time for that. as a consequence, he ended up thinking that what he thought was important to say in his heart was of no interest. since nobody cared, or so it seemed to him. this was an important time because from this moment on, he felt completely understood. and so i asked him, now that he knew i understood him, whether he would leave the past behind and be interested to join me in the present, whether he was interested in changing his way of life. clearly, he was. and so i told him, for this to happen, there is something important for you to do: it's to get rid of everything linked to this hardship and that still weighs on you. he agreed to do so. to relieve himself of his burden. and to my great surprise, i met a bold, adventurous little boy, very eager to join me, and go to this conference. once this change had taken place, i turned to the critic and asked, ""so how are things for you now? do you still need to play this role in my life?"" and once again, to my surprise he said, ""no i don't need to anymore. i see that you can take care of this boy, he is safe now."" i then asked, ""would you accept to play another part, to do something else, less difficult, less burdening?"" he said, ""ok. i will be your adviser now. i will assist you. so, the little boy, the adviser, and myself got to work. we prepared the conference, and people quite liked it. why did i choose to tell you this story here tonight? after all, it is a story pertaining to familiar elements: being hurt, being defensive. and maybe one would frown upon such a happy ending. still, there are key points i want to share with you, linked to my own experience, both with this little boy, but also with the therapy model i came here to tell you about. first, the importance to meet the parts within ourselves. how important this relationship is. second, why is it stuck inside? as a result of what? and that not dealing with it will prevent any change. thirdly, it can change. there is a plan b. what i did when i looked within was that i connected with it. i could have talked to somebody about my problem. i even could have mentioned my parts to them. but instead, i went within myself, francois within francois, and connected with these parts, first the critic, then the boy. and this is essential. because when a connection is created from within myself, changes occur, a feeling of security and trust emerges. and this allows for an important thing to happen: which is for this critic to show himself beyond what he tells me; who he truly is, his underlying positive intention towards me, he wanted to protect me. it allows him to take a risk. the second thing was why was it all stuck inside? why was the boy stuck in the apartment? the answer is quite simple. it is because of his burden. what is his burden? it is the suffering which is attached to the hardship. and this suffering is still there. it was in or on the little boy. the little boy was stuck there, thinking he was not interesting. the problem with the burden, and the parts of us bearing it, is that these parts absorb it all. these parts believe they are the burden itself. they forgot that they are merely bearing it, they believe they are it. and as a result, this burden becomes a poison. a genuine poison. bums in our societies, we like them so long as they are far enough from us. they are dirty, they stink, they drink, they yell, theyre unclean. and so we tend to stay away from these members of society. the same thing happens within ourselves. there are parts of ourselves who are not attractive, who stink, who have experienced such hardships, that have come to be unworthy of love. because they are not pretty inside. and so within ourselves, we do the same thing we do with bums. we shield ourselves from them and isolate them inside. how do we do that? well, it is quite simple actually. there are other parts in us, who are quite good at this and create a protective barrier. they are called protectors. so who are the protectors? well, they are these parts in us which are linked to our habits, our reassuring ways of dealing with things. for example, taking a little pill before going to bed, because it is a little too hard without it. or to have a couple of glasses because there is a difficult meeting ahead and we want to be relaxed. or this overwhelming urge to succeed in life, or to rely on your intellect to understand everything, or to do sports because one has to release one's energy somehow and calm one's anxiety. all these behaviors, which are a little bit over the top, which make us feel like we dont really have a choice in the matter. these are the protectors. within us. there are parts within us, doing all this. and fortunately so. because they help us cope with our pain. they help prevent us from feeling down. and when we feel down, because we are in contact with these wounded parts, they help us getting away from them, because it is just too painful to stay there. the problem is that these parts are scared. because they know that if they stop what they are doing, the fire of pain will rise again in our lives. and so, this fear prevents them from stopping. why? well, since the wounded parts are convinced that they are their own burden, that they are dirty, the protective parts have no choice but to protect them. and behave in our lives sometimes to extremes even to the point of being destructive, either for us or for others. this is the first tragedy. the second tragedy is that we end up thinking the same thing they do. that change is not an option, that we are stuck with this forever. and that is why it is important to know that there is a plan b. plan b is the plan you use whenever what you tried first did not succeed. plan a is i'm hurt, i protect myself. plan b is something else. it is doing what i did, it is going within myself, francois within francois, meeting these parts. it is important because first, it allows for the understanding of the intention, the history, the pain. but mostly, it brings security. it allows for my protectors, your protectors to stand aside enough so that i, in a loving way, can access these wounded parts, and when these parts feel the compassion and love, they agree to do what my little boy did, which is to release their burden. and to come back to their real nature. and from then on, our protective parts can consider stopping what they do; what they are exhausted doing, and causes us problems in life. this person, this francois within francois who could do all this, is like a flame inside. it is who i really am deep inside of me. in the ifs psychotherapy model, i am introducing to you tonight, the internal family systems model, this flame is called the self. and i would like to leave you with a message that we share, the adviser, the little boy, and myself. this message is that this self is always here no matter what happened to us, even the worst situations. even in the most chronic situations, this flame is always here, available, as an invitation to our protectors to trust, and an invitation to these suffering parts to relieve themselves from their pain; an invitation to our parts to relieve themselves from what weighs on them and come back to their true nature. thank you."
Poetry as Healer,Glenis Redmond,"good afternoon, everyone. oh, wait a minute. im a hometown girl, so when i say, good afternoon, i need some, hello. good afternoon, everyone. thats a little bit better. thats some hello for you. my name is glenis redmond and i am here to talk to you as poetry as healer. before i do that, i want to say that there are three lives to poetry, thats whats been said. its first, when you read it. second, when you write it. and the third, its when you speak it to life. when i was investigating that, i thought, that is wonderful, and it is so true. and i teach that all across the country. but, what i realized is that theyre missing one thing -- one, when you read it. two, when you listen to it. three, when you write it. four, when you speak it to life. poetry has been a healing medium in my life. i know, because in 1993 here in greenville, south carolina i was diagnosed with a chronic illness, fibromyalgia. some of you are familiar with it, some of you might not be. its a muscle disorder, a pain disorder, which has a host of other symptoms -- tmj -- not good for a poet -- carpal tunnel, not good for a poet. a host of digestive issues and food allergies. not good for anybody. my doctor came up and said to me, glenis, ive got some good news and some bad news. good news is, youre not gonna to die from this. the bad news, youre gonna sure wish you would have. when i heard these words i was working here in greensville, south carolina in the early nineties. and i thought, well, that is like getting pretty much close to a death sentence. and i remember at the time i was married, i was a clinical counselor and my twin daughters amber and celeste were twins. and i could barely hold myself together to do work, take care of them. and i remember one moment, in particular, that i was laying on my couch, wondering, what am i going to do with my life? and i was watching tv, i was watching pbs, i was watching -- bill moyers, who is my guru -- and he had a show called the language of life. it was a poetry festival, the dodge poetry festival. and i will never forget this moment, it was as if the universe was talking directly to me, through a poet that stepped up on the podium and said these words, wont you celebrate with me what i have shaped into a kind of life? born in babylon nonwhite and woman, what could i see to be but myself? i made it up here on this bridge between starshine and clay, my one hand holding tight my other hand. wont you come celebrate with me that everyday something has tried to kill me and has failed. those were the words of lucille clifton that acted like a lightning rod, got me up literally and metaphorically up off my couch and i began to pursue poetry. at the same time i was doing a little book called the artist way by julia cameron. that book lit a fire in me, i started working with the south carolina arts commission. the poem that i want to do for you now is i want to talk to you about the healing impact of poetry. there is numbers out there. im not a numerologist when it comes to poetry. i just know that poetry scooped this hand in and healed me. but now doctors, therapists understand the healing impact of poetry. it slows the heart beat down. i want to do this poem as a signature poem of mine. and i want you to just kind of get in touch with your feelings: what does this poem do for you? this poem is dedicated to my mama who happens to be out there in the audience. her name is jeanette redmon. without her i would not be the woman i am today. this poem is called mamas magic. it goes like this: my mama is magic! always was, always will be. there is one phrase that constantly bubbled from the lips of her five children, my mama can do it. we thought my mama knew everything. believed she did, as if she were born full blown from the encyclopedia britannica. i could tell you stories of how she transformed a rundown paint peeled shack into a home. how she heated us with tin tub baths from a kettle on the stove. poured it over in there like an elixir. my mama is protection like those quilts her mama used to make. she tucked us in with cut out history all around us. we found we could walk anywhere in this world and not feel alone. my mama never whispered the shame of poverty in our ears. she taught us to dance to our own shadows. pay no attention to those grand parties on the other side of the tracks. make your own music, shed say as she walked and cleaned the sagging boards of that place. youll get there. youll get there. her broom seemed to say with every wisp. we were my mamas favorite recipe. she whipped up us with her two big brown hands in a big brown bowl supported by her big brown arms. we were homemade children. stitched together with homemade love. we didnt get everything we ever wanted but we lacked for nothing. we looked at the stars in my mamas eyes and they told us we owned the world. we walked like kings and queens even on midnight trips to the outhouse. we were under her spell. my mama didnt study at no harvard or yale. but the things she knew you couldnt learn in no book! like... how to make your life sing like sweet potato pie sweetness out of an open window. how to make anybody, anybody feel at home. how at just the right moment be silent and with those eyes say, everythings gonna be alright, chil, everything is gonna be alright. how she tended to our sickness. how she raised our spirits. how she kept flowers living on our dilapidated porch in the midst of family chaos. my mama raised children like it was her business in life. put us on her hip and kept on moving, keeping that house pine-sol clean. yeah! my mama is magic. always was, always will be. her magic? how to stay steady and sure in this fast paced world. now when people see me with my head held high and my back erect and look at me with that -- who does she think she is? i keep on walking with the assurance inside. im black magic! and im jeanette redmonds child. as time went on i was booked by a national booking agency, the loyd artists. i started working for the kennedy center in washington d.c. as a teaching artist and i just returned from new brunswick new jersey where i am the poet in residence for a month at the state theater. they send me out into the community and ive seen the healing impact that it has had on people in prison and homes, halfway houses, and schools, senior citizens and this next poem that im going to end with is a poem that was inspired by middlesex county academy in new brunswick where i was working with gang members, and also a group from -- we were working with addictions. this poem is called bruised, i wrote for them. they banter back and forth like boys do: you charcoal, son. you so black you purple. i tell them, holup in defense of my mahogany skin and the boy theyre putting down. you know what they say? in cue as if we rehearsed it, we both chime, the darker the berry, the sweeter the juice. we flash twin smiles. theres a moment when the air gets less complicated in the room. the space is large enough for me to ask, why yall hate on each other so hard? oh, he? he my boy. see, thats how we show love. im so tired of everybody being gangsta hard, i want to weep. they are keeping it real though cause i got three brothers and growing up i never saw them show love, except in that man on man dunk-in-yo-face, call-you-ignant-ten-times-a-day way. their talk swags like their walk. the conversation dips and drags. and we end up talking about how we were punished as kids. and i lead with, im from the south yall and yall dont know nothin about no switch -- havin to go round back fetch your own hickory, the same one used to beat you. i say these words and i can still feel the sting of the switch. see the welts raising to an angry language of graffiti on my skin. another one says, and dont bring back no skinny one neither. i nod my head in solidarity -- the blood we spill makes us kin. another boy says, what about those belts? and i can hear my mamas beating cadence, i -- told -- you -- not -- to -- didnt -- i! another says, extension cord. im brought fully awake, cause i dont know nothing bout that kind of beatin. we only heard of cedric down the street gettin beat like that. then, we did not know the phrase child protective services. we did not know the word, abuse. we just said his mama was mean. jicante, another one says, huh? you kneel on your knees on raw rice for hours. we go down dark alleys; they go deeper into the shadows further than i have ever been, but we dont skip a beat. we laugh, we joke about our beatings. nobody, nobody, nobody mentions the pain 'cause its all understood, we are all battered. we bump up against each others wounds before we brainstorm. i pick up the marker they bicker blue versus red. i read between the gang signs. it is not lost on me, when these colors mingle, they make purple. i muse in my mind how violence for them still continues. but we come back to these poems, the poems we are here to write; the ones that had saved my life. but these detours down old roads is a place we had to go, places we have been loved so hard it hurts, so hard we are still bruised. we bear our scars, and then we pick up our pens and write. i want to thank you. i have seen people's lives change. ive seen them pull up and rearrange their lives, their perspective all through poetry. and my idea that were spreading: if you dont have poetry in your life, get you some. thank you."
La necessitat de comunicar-se,Yago de Marta,"since the source is strong and the city light is intense, they said that i had come back from a trip and now im leaving again. it has to do with what im going to talk about now, which is the need to communicate. i was eager to share with you what im going to discuss now. i felt i needed to do it; if i hadn't, it would have been left hanging. when i was about to miss my flight to come here, i felt like a black hole was forming in my week, wondering what i would do if i didnt see you, and although we didn't know each other yet, i knew i wanted to share what i had with you, to share the emotions and lessons learned from a real experience. if you notice, the second conference without knowing exactly its name, ended up saying that the greatest human need is communication. but then there was a man who came along to disrupt everything in 1977, david wilkins, who wrote a book called ""the book of lists."" in this book, he told us that the greatest fear of humans is public speaking. the problem is that this was replicated by book writers, specialists, and psychologists, ignoring the root cause. weve been told countless times that the greatest fear of humans is public speaking. we see an interview about a new course on public speaking, and someone comes along and says, yes, this is very important because we know that the greatest fear of humans is public speaking. the same thing happens when were reading magazines that offer small tips saying that the greatest fear of humans is public speaking. connecting this with the first conference, this is a clear example of how when we are told that something is scientific or there is a study backing it, we automatically believe it. this test was done with 3,000 people, but we dont know what kind of people they were. they were asked to list their fears, including heights, insects, spiders, flying, and it turned out that the most common of all was public speaking. but we still dont know who these people were that the test was conducted on. if they were university students, as is often the case with american studies, its easy to understand what happened. all feared making a presentation. however, ordinary people might not even consider this fear, or consider it at all. if public speaking is the greatest fear for most people, i wonder if we saw our audience as zombies, like in an episode of ""the walking dead"" or a romero movie, how should we approach it? moreover, my question is this: books tell us that when you fear public speaking, you should imagine the audience naked. i tried this at first and then stopped, as it made me more nervous. others say not to worry because when the lights are so bright you cant see anything. thats a lie; if someone is giving you a bad look or making a gesture, you notice it. but when we are here, it feels like when an animal is alone with no escape routes. there are three people who wont let me out; there are no exits, and im surrounded by zombies. this is how they want us to see it, justifying our fear. when we go to school, its normal that a kid doesnt want to speak in public because its supposedly the greatest fear of humans. this has been repeated since 1987, and weve come to believe it because its a scientific study. so, can we really do something to face it? ill ask a question now: among the people here, who fears more: dying by fire or speaking in public? im sorry for david because andorrans are an exception to this statistic; their greatest fear is dying by fire. its like the asterix village where everyone wants to watch football. the point is, there are greater fears, so why are we deceived into thinking that the greatest fear is public speaking? jefferson, george washington, bono from u2, elvis presley, and even marta had the same fear of public speaking. this makes me feel much better. its a fear i share with great figures. its a fear, but its less than what i was told. and when you have to train a group of people with severe psychotic profiles, you certainly feel like youre on the edge, as if you could fall into an abyss. despite having experience with various complex groups and difficult situations, working with psychotic profiles is especially challenging for one reason: when we think of this, we think of someone flying over the cuckoo's nest, or what was once called madness, and that scares us. its because we are deeply ignorant; we dont understand the reality of these groups who live in our society and need a place in it. we look away, ignoring them, like when i was a child and thought there was a monster in my room and hid under the blanket, hoping not to see it. people with special needs exist in our society and show us how important and powerful the need to communicate is. there were people in the room with their heads down, arms crossed, and moving, seeming unreachable. experts said that these people could not speak in public. but there is always light at the end of the tunnel. these people, whom we try not to see because we would have to react if we did, wanted to share things with us. they wanted to share their dreams and passions. one person was a fan of world war ii, another was a fan of the band héroes del silencio, and a girl loved cooking, even if she wasnt very good at it. this was the light at the end of the tunnel: they had something to share, something to offer. so instead of listening to critics and specialists who say, lets not put this person in these circumstances because they cant do it, lets recover the essence that brought me here: everyone has something to share, and they want to share it with as many people as possible. this same drive is what leads us to tweet and post on facebook; we want to share what we feel. this is the light at the end of the tunnel. of course, when these people had the chance to speak, they stopped thinking about their fear of public speaking. they stopped thinking that their fear was justified by books or specialists and started thinking only about the people in front of them. when you think about the person in front of you, you forget about the fear, the exhaustion, and the sleeplessness. you forget about the fear of public speaking."
Explorar la fantasia para habitar la realidad,Yolanda Reyes,"hello. i'm happy to be with you again, to have returned to the mountain. what does it take to be a writer? can you live off writing? what advice could you give us? these are questions people always ask me when i visit schools or libraries, young people like you. and although... the truth is, i dont have an answer that fits everyone, i read between the lines of these questions that there are people in your family or friends with very good intentions who are probably telling you: oh, so you want to be a writer, youre going to make movies or be an artist. youre going to starve! guitarist, writer... maybe as a teacher; in other words, double starving because we know that in our society being a teacher doesnt have much prestige either. i cant give you the answer youre expecting. those who want to live off storytelling, despite the fact that i pay bills with stories, and despite the fact that in a much broader sense i make a living with words, think of scheherazade. sometimes i feel like i make a living with the column i write, but i also get a lot of ear pulls, and i cant say anything different from what worked for me. i just tell young people in those meetings that reading was very helpful to me. and that answer, of course, makes teachers happy. they all say: ""you see, reading."" i say, of course, reading, because since i was a child i liked books and that nourished my thinking, my structures. and even to tell a story one needs to have read a lot. and up to that point, everyone is happy, especially the teachers. but then, i add another answer which is to play a lot. and they look at me like i'm an alien. they say, ""how come, play a lot?"" and i say, ""well, pretend,"" finally, thats what 2-year-old children do. you say, lets pretend youre the dad and im the mom and were going out, and that here was the field, and over here there was a horse and we would ride it, and wed go on a boat. thats what we do when we create stories. thats what we invent: creating conventions, saying, lets pretend you were juliana, and i was valeria and that this happened, and that this movie started here. the only difference with the game of children is that it requires hard work. much more than 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration so that the seams dont show, and thats serious work for those who want to get into this. however... however, this idea of fantasy... people say: oh how beautiful fantasy is! you work... of course, half the time im working with children, ages 2, 3, 4, 5 in a workshop that asks about the connections between literature and art and early childhood development and they still say how beautiful imagination is, oh! such lovely children, how beautiful imagination is. well, in a way, yes, but imagination, and thats what i want to talk about today, underlies all human inventions. think about this madness were in today where someone in tokyo can see us while were talking here. it might have seemed like science fiction to my grandparents. however, there is nothing more real to us than the internet. the world and all its inventions seem to participate in that fantastic breath of building possible worlds that is the same as my 2, 3, 4-year-old children have when they play ""lets pretend,"" a skyscraper, a suspension bridge over the sea, a song, a symphony if you look at it, it is based on that same scheme of something visible and something invisible. lets pretend that these symbols, these alphabets, these digits meant something else and lets start working with symbols and thats the world. and yet, education... look at the basic skills curricula and ask them, look up a word processor and ask the primary and secondary curricula how many ""imagine"" there are, how many ""repeat"", how many ""create"" there are, how many ""identify"", well, lets not even mention ""dream""... no curriculum shows it, ive searched with a magnifying glass. how many ""play,"" how many ""create"" possible worlds, how many ""do,"" how many ""ask"" something, how many ""answer,"" how many ""explore,"" repeat what others said. and look at television programs we have to be like others; we risk our lives to be like shakira, instead of building voices. how many ""build voices"" are there in the curricula? how many ""venture hypotheses"" and how many ""get lost"" in the middle of a process, in the middle of uncertainty. that applies equally to sciences and arts. and what ive seen is that these little ones i work with, who have taught me so much over the years, have very porous and wild boundaries. for them, researching and imagining are close verbs. this makes questions too, i dont know if you remember your childhood, but why, why, why did dinosaurs become extinct? hey, why dont airplanes fall from the sky? why do people die? childhood is an existentially difficult and terrible age and art at that time of life is profoundly salvific. so, how to think? how to think of a pedagogy that rescues the breadth of curiosity, for example, the joy of discovery. an artistic pedagogy that goes beyond coloring within the lines, at a time when lines are being erased for all of us. how to think of a system and an educational world that prepares these little ones... for what? do we know what it will prepare them for? i look at these 2, 3-year-old children and i ask: what of what they are learning today will serve them to inhabit their reality? what possible worlds will they visit? if they tell me that space travel is a given, if we all know that books as we knew them are on the way to extinction, what will books be like, what will curricula be for these children? what of what they are learning today will serve them to inhabit their reality? i know youve asked yourselves that same question, the same one we asked ourselves. what of what we were taught in school will be useful for life, will be useful for the future? well, that question at this moment is so undeniable and there is such a large gap between those children and you that i fear they will look at you as if you were their great-grandparents. a child of one year right now or a child being born is as separated from yousorry to say youre oldas i am from my great-grandmother. there are so many inventions and such vast horizons... where will they live? in this orbit or the other? so when one works in education and with art, that idea that literature is something so beautiful and that imagination is so lovely because children are so imaginative starts to become, not just something lovely, and yes it is lovely, but a vital and cognitive power, a basic alphabet for exploring possible worlds. what can i give to children? what can literature give to these little ones? what can literature give to you? what can the experience of art give to you? the possibility of adding to all learning processes that fantastic breath that imagination gives us, the crazy one in the house. i dont know how knowledge is framed in a world so close to science fiction. yes, we are leaving imagination, the horizon of questions behind. what would i say about what needs to be done and what you are doing? and thats why i love being here, moving between questions, moving from one question to another, and what we should be forming in you is not the ability to answer but the ability to ask more questions; to go from one to another and another because thats the world youll face. its a difficult world, many enigmas are already emerging. there are many hard, difficult things; there are moral dilemmas you will have to resolve that will be in your hands and in the hands of the children i work with. for example, when to end life, for example, which genetic elements to leave in the embryo and which to manipulate. for example, whether life on this planet will be sustainable. for example, if in these global protocols we will continue to say nonsense or take commitments. for example, the terrifying inequality of this planet that is already being talked about, that young people like you all over the world are talking about, are filling plazas. and thats where the crazy one in the house in literature starts to speak the language of particularity. you will need to have imaginative empathy to weigh the human consequences of your decisions. someone will have to do it and art, literature, and philosophy will be essential. because they will give people amid... i say people, people amid the avalanche, the noise, the media din, the twitter feed, the news about the world and other possible worlds... literature and art will give them news from the depths of themselves and i believe that young people will need imagination so that their ships can take off and reach very distant places. but they will also need it to know who they are, to explore the depths of themselves, to undertake those old tasks of knowing yourself and knowing others, to put yourself in the shoes of others who feel, think... to gather the accumulated experience of humanity because thats what literature is; if you look, Odysseuss journeys, Madame Bovarys weariness, Hamlets to be or not to be, love poems, elegies, what are they if not yellow butterflies? Cortázar, ""Casa tomada,"" what are they if not voices that account for the passage of others through the world, that gather the accumulated experience of so many people, from particularity? Not from theory but from the deepest hearts. and you will need to have those insights, to account for those insights that go beyond generic terms like humanity, women, children, human rights. What do art, cinema, and literature speak of? They speak of the one by one, of the depths of human beings. That language inhabited by real, particular subjects. That language for those who want and ask what is needed to be a writer, what advice could be given? The only thing I could say is that you wont starve, that in this increasingly technological but also increasingly imaginative world, there will be a need for people who tell stories. Because if you think about it, each of us is a storyi agree with youwhat is our life if not an attempt to piece together a narrative of our own, to give coherence to the random, disconnected events of life and create meaning from that. Imagination, the crazy one in the house, what you have here today, is a product of someone's imagination, a dream that grew and grew and then someone dreamed that dream and gave it voice. I wish you never stop asking questions, that you continue to wander in questions, that you torment yourselves and get entangled in the uncertainty and the questions. Thats all, thank you very much."
 A Growth Mindset for a Creative Mind,Bosse Larsson, i will talk about two things first of all about our view of creativity what we think it is and secondly about changing changing your mind and actually even more about changing your mindset i'm a typical example of this because if someone had asked me 10 years ago would you like to give a talk in english no not really would you like to do it for exactly 18 minutes no i won't would you like to do it in front of an audience with very high expectations and important people definitely not would you like to be recorded live and people could view you afterwards and laugh and say that was not correct english grammar no definitely not so that's why i'm here today you understand i think you will understand after this 18 minutes that i've done some traveling in that sense okay but first ken robinson he talks about being educated out of creativity and i think that if you put his thinking into some kind of diagram it would look something like this you have knowledge increasing by h it should but you have creativity decreasing by h and i put two or three questions here at the beginning you ask why you want to know things you want to understand and you ask why not because you question what you take for granted but then after a while and the schooling takes on and you start asking what is the right answer and i think it's not only for schools i think it continues into work life also but we want to have the right to answer so what could you do well i did a thing a couple of weeks ago i went to this event organized by a company or an organization who wanted to introduce creativity and entrepreneurship in schools i think it's good and it started very well they talked about a website and you could have a different kind of projects for schools but then at the end they have this they wanted to share things up so they wanted to have a creativity competition well that's good so we were divided into random groups that's good also and we were presented with this task be creative and make an airplane which flies as long as possible you understand the task right and we were given this good because we were given constraints that's good for creativity to have some things to work with so they gave us colored papers and tape scotch tape and paper clips i think there was some straws you know straws where you drink soda with and all of the people started doing things like this you recognize it of course because you've done them as a child and and we lined up for this competition all the teams and people were throwing them with quite bad result obviously but after a while comes a person who seem productive and throws it and it's an obvious winner isn't he no it's not i hear this man behind me saying if that's okay i'm not participating that's not that that was against the rules that's not okay and the people leaving this the people from this creative organization wanting schools to be more creative they said sorry that's disqualified that's not an airplane because it has no wings and i thought this was really educating after creativity why should we be so constrained to think that that was a bad solution well i think it's because we want creativity to be nice and beautiful and colored and a bit like art and people had also names on the sides as if it would make them fly better but this ugly one you know the ball of paper which is some way i can sign it off towards if you want to it wasn't accepted and i think it's a big problem we have there so i think we need to upgrade our view of creativity and you could do it best at wembley stadium we have all these people here ordinary people like you and me sitting all here and we have this space around here where you have all the advertising and and so on and we have the field and we are all watching the field and we are all watching the creative players hunt with who wants the stars the ones who knows all about creativity now i have a fine line up here on all sort i'm stein edison if you ask people you want two examples of creative people you will get this answers because they are quite obvious creative people right they are talents they are even born talents they are eccentric geniuses they are inventors in arts and music and i guess they are all male and they are all dead now and we have the team leader of the mold you know who this is who is it da vinci fantastic i thought you would say spider-man because it allows the picture isn't it but course in this context you have you recognize the man in the circle and i think we need to get away from this this kind of of icons of creativity and try to look it at it in in another way so let's look at the next level i call this i've stolen this from damn pink one point two point three point zero eight it is all about copying and and twisting a little bit so i take the responsibility for that and let's look at the next part it's about the business and business has really realized that creativity is important and there's a big survey last year of ibm which pointed out creativity as the number one asset for the future and it's something to listen to and we have all these creative companies right but the problem for me i'm not thinking that i'm leonardo da vinci and i'm not thinking i'm not working at one of those companies but i think we need to have creativity all over not only in these places and where you have all this atmosphere so i wanted to see something else so i thought about this more like creativity being more a general attitude and a mindset and i call it really creativity three points area and i will introduce you to a man who is he's not exactly leonardo da vinci and i don't think that he has ever worked on google but he's a nice fellow with a problem he has he has a car which is slightly too big to fit into the garage this this he will be talking in in not in english not in swedish but i think you will understand the context anyway you jane brain art is safe non-toxic safe the auto and encouragement only in the kubinashi fonda tree is the obvious problem you see this limit the negativity and mother asking doubt is namita very elastic yeah - tamesha centimeter see and dormant in the mujahidin taken a critical mistake and the truth about the criteria moose mu taking the moose lodge nicotine and the markets cruelly gonna be ready behind your head my hair has to show fear from flandre zane this letter look ready to talk to the millimeter and now we start and saying equals the auto industry getting a look outside at chronicle and now i'm gonna get my dear if i might not open do what i'm just gonna get here stephanie well and see doc can bleach em out auto castilian it stop and devour variety even that they did one they not so to connie and thomas kind of did avon the cake in it to do voila you did one notice two now these durkin to do and make it an idols happy noisy drone sonic rotor auto even if the rotor auto sbrega the hillman cinnamon ear and the meeting may feel worthless ooh kathy drag it now to stand de manera blanca berry the roman who called it a gland or to go in roman and pretend i'm kiddin bint is it movie ok so what is he all about well i think he's very creative but his it's a fantastic man he has it it takes on a challenge right he doesn't give up he takes on the challenge he challenges his own thinking about what is possible he also puts in a lot of effort in doing this you could see that here also carved in the wood dope in the door opening he had carved the wood to make the door possible to open and he probably had a few mistakes resilience is about dealing with mistakes they probably had a few ones on his way i could think that his neighbors would look a bit funny when he was doing all this but at the end he shows something else he to me he shows another mindset a growth mindset where you try to expand yourself and to develop and and become a creative person so let's look at some other examples this is about a person who was chairing kitchen together with other students and every time she came to the kitchen it was full and other people were were cooking food so she thought about another solution not giving up not saying ok i'll go to mcdonald's or whatever she looked at the coffee brewer and started making food in a coffee brewer making boiling pasta and so on and even made a blog which was an experiment in cooking but you could do all these things you could you could see the fish in here it's not so tasty but anyways and it was it was voted the food blog of the year it says more about swedish food culture maybe that that's something else and she put everything in there not not the cat i think because if you if you i think you should run it through the mixer first before before i put it in the coffee brewer and she looked at another place what can you do to fry a steak and now a hair straightener and it's all you know with this frying forceps that's a new way of thinking isn't it i don't know it's probably one of those don't try this at home things but you get a steak with with a taste of shampoo and another way of looking at things if you want to start a hotel you can you have all these four and five stars hotel around you you could look another way you could start with a zero star hotel they have a fantastic slogan the only star is you and they put beds in the basement and you could sleep there 400 swedish crowns or sheep fare and they had is gathering every night where you got this lottery ticket and they had they pull the winner and the winner had the advantage of going upstairs and taking a shower the only one who could take the shower this is now a museum and it's spreading a little bit and another one is you all look very fit so you go to the gym don't you you go to the gym yes and you've all drink water yes okay and when you drink water you want to fill the bottle right yes but it's not that easy in the water basin always because you have to have this angle where you have to have the tap here and some of the water is not coming into the bottle you recognize this problem and you get it filled to scientifically 69% every time because you can't feel it done and this was something which leonardo da vinci didn't do anything about and not to create two companies but the 15 year old girl she put another opening here and solves the problem that's a new way of thinking solving things so i'm gonna go a little bit further into those three ones about challenge and effort and resilience and talk about the mindset and there is a psychologist at stanford university named carol dweck and she discovered by examining motivation for 25-30 years that were some driving forces behind how you think as she invented this theory or mindset it's very simple but it's very effective and i've been thinking a lot about it what is the mindset it's your beliefs about certain things it's your beliefs about being creative do you think it's something that you are born with or if it's something that you developed you could think the same about leadership if you're a leader in a company or in school do you think it's something that you had from the beginning all these abilities or do you think something that you can develop over years deliberate practice and you can think the same about the entrepreneurship and musicianship and so on and so it all comes down to a question what you believe if you're a born talent or if you think that the brain has so much plasticity changing so that you can can develop a lot by that and she talks about the fixed mindset and the growth mindset and the fixed mindset is if you think that everything is carved in stone set in stone you have a certain amount of abilities and that's it that's the fixed mindset the growth mindset says that you have a starting point with your talents but it's a starting point and you can't really predict the potential you can reach very very high potential if you continue instead of thinking that it's just something you have or have not and this has some consequences because if you look at those three ones which i think are some of the driving forces behind creativity and also behind learning it has some interesting results because if if you are faced with a challenge the fixed mindset would say no i won't take on that challenge because if i fail i've been proven that i didn't have enough so why should i try i want to look smart so i won't try if i'm not sure of completing the task easily the growth mindset on the other hand thinks well if you have if you want to learn you have to stretch yourself and you have to go out to the practice zone and go into the learning zone instead so learning is the only way to take to to get by by being challenged by doing something harder and to to work with it so it's a different way how you look upon a challenge if you have a fixed mindset you look upon effort at something you shouldn't have to do because if you're good you should do it anyway you should do it from the beginning you are a good person you're good football player you don't have to train that lot but if you look from the growth mindset view you will say that well the only way the brain is not biologically but more like a metaphor it's a muscle to make it better you have to train and the only way is by effort that's how you get better and thirdly about resilience the ability to bounce back when you've had mistakes setbacks and obstacles so if you have a fixed mindset you would say that i'm a personal failure because i've gotten the proof that i don't have enough so it's a mistake i'm bad i don't have it but on the other hand if you look at the growth mindset it would say all right this was a mistake i have to do something else maybe change strategy or change how much i worked with it so it's it's a different mindset and i have done the traveling from being somewhere here which would have made me say no never do this to going over there and say all right i'll do it i will survive and i will probably learn something of it this is about equally divided among people when you do this investigation i can't go into all the results but but you could transfer but half of the people are fixed mindsets thinking but you could change then you should change and you could change by by knowing the mechanisms like this and it's also important to feedback if you work with other people and also how you are given feedback if you're giving feedback like you're a perfect person you're fantastic it's a general feedback but you should be working on the feedback on challenge feedback on the effort and feedback on resilience then you will reach much better potential regarding creativity and learning thank you for listening
Exercise and the Brain,Wendy Suzuki,"how exciting to be here. what i'm going to try and do today is add
to the amazing lineup of speakers today by bringing the brain into our discussion of the creative spark. and i want to do that by telling you
about some of the newest research that i've been doing in my neuroscience research lab at new york university, asking the question: can aerobic exercise,
that is can going to the gym actually improve your learning, memory and cognition? i also want to address the question of whether increased aerobic exercise can also make you more creative. now, i remember the day that i realized i wanted to become a neuroscientist. i was a freshman at uc berkeley, and i was taking a freshman seminar class, with just 10 or 15 of us, called ""the brain and its potential,"" taught by marian diamond. she was standing
at the front of the classroom, and she had this beautiful hat box. and with her gloved hands, she opened that hat box, and out she pulled
a real, live, fixed human brain. now, it was the very first time i'd seen a human brain, and what she told us was
that what she was holding in her hands was the most complex structure known to mankind; it's the only structure
that can think about itself. and one of the most amazing things about the brain is that it can change as a function of the environment; it can learn; it can grow. and i thought that was the coolest thing i'd ever heard in my whole life. and i didn't know it that day, but that idea of the brain and its potential and what's called neural plasticity - the ability to change as a function of the environment - was going to become my life's work in science. that's what i want
to tell you about today. so i started out studying a structure in the brain called the hippocampus. it's really important for long-term memory. but more recently, i've become interested in how exercise can actually improve our learning, memory and cognition. and i got interested in that not because
i read a paper or went to a talk; i went to the gym. when i turned 40, i decided i wanted to get in the best shape of my life, and i went to the gym, and the class that i found that kept me coming back to the gym on a really regular basis was a class called ""intensati,"" developed by this amazing fitness instructor named patricia moreno in new york city. now, intensati is unique because it takes physical movements from kickbox, dance, yoga and martial arts, but the unique part is that it pairs each physical movement with a positive, spoken affirmation. what do i mean by that? so, in intensati, we don't just punch; we say, ""i am strong now."" and the class says it back to you. so what happens is that you not only get that great aerobic exercise, but because you're speaking out, you actually get an increase in aerobic output and it makes you feel great. so the bottom line was i got in great shape. but there were two amazing benefits that i noticed. one was that i had this amazing motivation; i felt like a million bucks after i came out of this class. and i couldn't wait to go back. and i thought, ""my gosh, patricia moreno is an amazing teacher to instill that kind of motivation."" and then i thought, ""well, wait a second, i'm a teacher. i wonder if my students feel that way after my neuroanatomy class.""  i'm going to come back to that in a second. the second amazing benefit was that when i went back to work - when i started doing intensati i was writing a lot of grants - and i noticed that as i got more regular with the workouts, my writing got easier. i was able to make associations better; i was able to focus better, and i thought, ""this is amazing. i want to look at the neuroscience literature to understand what's going on."" and i looked at the literature - a lot of new studies coming out as well as looking at some of the older studies that had led to our current understanding. and when i looked at those, i found a very familiar name. that name was marian diamond. so she was not only my undergraduate advisor, but she was a real pioneer in neuroscience research, and really only one of the only women working in this field back in the late 1950s and '60s, when she discovered
that when you raise rats in what she called an ""enriched environment,"" with lots of toys to play with, other rats to play with, and they run around a lot, and you compared their brains to rats raised in what she called an ""impoverished environment,"" with no toys, just a couple of rats in a small box, what you can do is measure their brain. you measure, actually, the thickness of that outer covering of their brain called the cortex. and what she found is that the rats
raised in enriched environments had cortices that were actually thicker; their brain grew as a function of this enriched environment. and later studies showed that exercise, the increased exercise those rats were getting because they were running around a lot more, was a big factor in that brain change. so i thought, ""okay, this is an area that i really want to get to know."" and as a professor, the best way to get to knowa topic area is to teach a class. so i decided i'm going
to teach a class at nyu called ""can exercise change your brain?"" and i decided because i got inspired
to do this because of exercise, i thought, ""wouldn't it be great if i
could bring exercise into the classroom and not only teach students about what
exercise is doing to their brain but also teach them, have them experience
what exercise felt like?"" so i thought, ""i could do this."" so i decided to go to the gym,
and of course i loved intensati, so i became a certified
intensati instructor and a certified fitness instructor. i could tell you, ""oh, it was so hard. i was teaching classes,
i was writing grants,"" but the truth is it was so much fun. it was really fun because i got to learn
a whole new way to move, a whole new way to motivate students,
and i stayed in great shape. so there was nothing better. so i had this class; i was teaching. i was going to teach
an hour of aerobic exercise. i trained for six months to be able
to teach in front of this class - i had never done this before,
but i thought it'd be fun - so teach an hour of aerobic exercise,
an hour of intensati, followed by an hour-and-a-half lecture
on the effects of exercise in the brain. but then i realized
i had my first study right there: my students could be my subjects
in my first study. all i had to do was test them cognitively at the beginning,
at the end of the semester and compare their performance
to a class that didn't exercise and ask whether, in fact, exercise
could improve their cognitive performance. so that's exactly what i did. and before i tell you what our prediction was
and what our results were, i just want to take you back
for a moment to september 7, 2009, which was the first day of this
""can exercise change your brain?"" class. and it's seared in my memory mainly
because i was really scared and nervous. i give many, many lectures;
i love giving lectures, but this one, i was very nervous. why? because my goal was
to actually try and inspire these kids to love exercise in the way
that patricia moreno inspired me, but also inspire them to love neurobiology
and the brain and plasticity, the way that marian diamond inspired me. so i had a pretty high bar, and i was pretty scared
to step out in front of that classroom. but i have to say, i think
the students were a bit scared too. they'd never come to a class where the instructor
came in workout clothes; they'd never sweated
in front of their professor, and i got a lot of nervous laughter when i told them they were going
to have to say positive affirmations. no, not say, yell
positive affirmations in class. but i have to say, it was the most
memorable first class i've ever taught. the students really got into it. okay, there was nervous laughter
and a lot of giggling, but they really got into it. they were shouting the affirmations; they were really going all out in the workout, and the best thing was that motivation and that inspiration oozed over into our academic, our lecture, part. they remained engaged, asked lots of questions. it was a fantastic first class and a fantastic semester. so what did we find? so our prediction goes back to that structure that i said was important for long-term memory, the hippocampus. it goes back to the hippocampus because the hippocampus is one of only two brain structures where new brain cells, new neurons, are born. so you and i have shiny, new hippocampal cells being born in our hippocampus. but the cool thing is that experimental studies in animals have shown that increased aerobic exercise can actually enhance the birth of those new hippocampal neurons and make them live even longer. so our prediction was that this increase in aerobic exercise in my nyu students would actually improve their learning and memory, improve their ability to learn new pieces of information and improve their ability to retain those new pieces of information. did we find that? well, we tested them on a whole battery of different cognitive tests, and what we found was one significant improvement in my class. that improvement was in the ability to encode new long-term memories. what task was that? it was a complicated task; it was actually a quite difficult task. students were given a really complex geometrical image - it was like an etch-a-sketch image - and then after a delay, they would have to discriminate between that etch-a-sketch image and one that looked very, very similar to it. my students got significantly faster at identifying the correct image that they saw before. so they're able to separate out things that are coming in your memory. for example, you're meeting lots of new people here today, and so you might be better, if you exercise and come to my class, at differentiating between the faces of different people that you meet today. so that's a very, very useful thing to be able to do. so, is this new? what is new about this? well, it's new and exciting because - i have to say, we are not the only people, my lab is not the only lab interested in the effects of exercise, but the majority of the work has been done on looking at the effects of exercise in the elderly population. why? because cognitive decline is a major health issue in the elderly, not to even mention alzheimer's disease. the exciting news in the elderly population is that increased aerobic exercise has clearly been shown to improve cognition. so that's great, but the idea there is that there's decline already, so you have a little bit of room to see improvement. what about my healthy, young, very smart nyu neuroscience majors? they're at the peak of their cognitive abilities, as are you and i. could exercise actually help us? our studies suggest that, yes, they can. now, we're not only interested in learning, memory and cognition. but there's a really exciting link to the topic of today's conference. that is creativity. and that comes from one of the newest directions of study of the hippocampus. we've known for a very, very long time that exercise can improve - sorry - that the hippocampus is important for long-term memory, but recent studies have suggested the hippocampus is also important for creativity and imagination. why? because patients with hippocampal damage have significant impairments at being able to imagine new situations. so we ask a patient with hippocampal damage, ""describe for me a tropical beach scene"" - they've never been to a tropical beach. they can barely say anything  about sand or water, whereas a control subject would be able to tell you about the white sand, and the corona in their left hand with that an umbrella in it, all these different details. so, the idea is the hippocampus is not only important for putting new associations in mind that help you remember the events like this in your past - it will be in your past - but also important for putting new concepts together in unique ways, the basis of both creativity and imagination. so what we want to do - we haven't done this - is to look at the effects of exercise not only on learning and memory but on increased creativity as well. so what's the bottom line here? the bottom line is simple: increased aerobic exercise can improve learning, memory and, possibly, creativity. what's more to know? and everybody wants a magic pill to get smarter. well, this isn't a pill, and it comes with a lot more sweat than a pill, but it can help you. it's free. it helps you every day, and our goal over the next ten years is trying to figure out exactly how that is helping you, what exactly is changing in the brain. so, i only have one question for you? who wants to go to the gym? anybody? okay. great.  thank you."
10 Seconds,Grant Oliphant,late one night in 1944 in german-occupied amsterdam three armed men burst into the apartment of this an apartment belonging it's this woman maria devries she lived there with her seven-year-old daughter and a young jewish woman named nell who had been hiding there with her for the previous year the intruders were dutch nazis who had been tipped off by a neighbor and as they hauled nell away ultimately to the camps their leader put a gun to maria's head and demanded to know the names of her contacts in the dutch underground you have ten seconds he told her ten nine eight now maria was in fact a member of the dutch underground and she had no illusions as to this man's intentions she had seen far too much cruelty for that seven six five four maria was a woman of great faith and she prayed and as she prayed a great clarity came to her she began to think lucidly about her situation she realized that if she told these men what they wanted to know they had no reason to keep her alive at least for now all they had were suspicions three-two-one well i don't know anything maria said i don't know what you're talking about i just took pity on a poor girl for a moment it seemed certain that the man would pull the trigger but abruptly he lowered his gun spit some invectives and with his companions walked out those hellish ten seconds in the life of maria therese were a classic countdown and what i want to argue to you today is that we as a society although we may live in the most countdown rich era in human history need to get a lot smarter about countdowns and to do that to deal with the sort of problems we've been describing today we need to start learning from people like maria devries this is your dictionary moment the word countdown didn't actually appear in the english language until 1952 and then it referred specifically to the backward counting that now celatum ate later made famous but over time and popular usage it came to refer to any marked counting of our progress toward a particular moment in time as in the countdown to war the countdown to summer the first countdown many of us encounter is this one at the hands of our parents and if you think by the way that this is a that's not fair it's a count up instead of a countdown think about it three is launch time this poor kid is totally doomed and and and what we know is that countdowns start happening in our head every time we start marking progress to a particular future time or event near as i can tell based on my research there are three ways we use countdowns in only three ways we use countdowns we use them to build tension as the dutch nazi did and as mom was doing we used them to control our anger you know take a breath and count to ten or count back from three and we use them to structure our response to deadlines that are approaching and measure our progress towards them now we tend to think that we're putting on in modern society and there were the only ones who have ever suffered deadline pressure but think about noah now noah was not given a deadline curiously to build the ark but to fill it with all the known species of the earth he had seven days and if you don't think he was counting down those days i don't know what you're thinking but today we have gotten exquisitely good at this whole process of counting down we count down everything we have countdowns to tell us how long it will take us to cross the street we have countdowns to tell us how long it will be before we get to talk to a live person we have countdowns to tell us how long till the next presidential election some people think this is good some bad we have we have countdowns to tell us how long how many shopping days left before christmas and by the way this is a real count and for those of you who are expecting gifts from me i need you to know this we we pretend to be put upon by these deadlines and we are we feel the pressure of them but we also love them they're an absolute staple of tv and film and books and entertainment of all types including the most emergent type digital games every almost every digit game has some element of a countdown in it this is a very one of the top most popular iphone apps now now think about that we actually load countdowns onto devices that we carry with us and willingly submit ourselves to so we arrive at this moment in human history where we are playing an ever-increasing game of beat the clock perpetually counting down the time on everything between where we are now and what we might want or need or fear or must do in the future and that makes a whole lot of sense when you're living in a complicated society because what science has shown us is that we're really bad at three things when it comes to complexity our minds can't fix complex tasks in time our minds are also really lousy at dealing with an overabundance of choice we're actually unhappy and become paralyzed in that situation and we're really bad at breaking difficult tasks into manageable chunks countdowns help us do all of those things overcoming those natural deficits but here here's a question i have for you because there's a problem here if that's why we're seeing such an explosion of countdowns why are we so lousy at the ones that really matter in terms of dealing with complexity be it what seemed like a pretty simple one on the debt crisis or dealing with some of the more complex tasks that we've been hearing about today like climate change like endemic poverty like world hunger like dealing with our dependence on foreign oil why are we so bad at even setting countdowns on those things i think one of the reasons is that we are training ourselves to view countdowns as this we are training ourselves to believe that if we miss one there'll always be another one and besides we can go out and celebrate by the way i endorsed this countdown i think it's a great one and we'll do it later but i believe that if we're gonna get serious about dealing with the issues we've been talking about in this room we need to adopt a philosophy of countdowns that takes us back more to this model the model of maria de reese or this is the late carnegie mellon professor randy pausch many of you in this room even worked with him many of us knew him and what was extraordinary about this man is he was given one of the worst countdowns imaginable and what he did with it transformed his ordeal into an international lesson that we all can admire maria and randy faced decidedly different countdowns but here's what they had in common they had five elements in common and based on what i've been able to determine these are the five elements of all truly consequential countdowns in our lives first of all they're imposed on us we don't choose them we don't load them on our phone they're being imposed on us by a by someone or something that is counting down time for us the stakes in them are extraordinarily high their life or death or feel like it they seem to offer us only really bad choices choices between bad and bad there's some level of uncertainty about them some level of agency on our part will affect them even if just at the margins and finally fifth there is a finality to them no matter what happens at the end of the countdown the world is never going to be the same when we get to the end of that countdown and having studied a lot of people like randy and maria what i can tell you is that they respond in five brilliant ways and these five brilliant ways are ones that we should all consider because consequential countdowns are a part of all of our lives even when we're not paying attention to them you all have them or you know people who do people who are counting down the time to an end of a life an end of a marriage an end of a relationship an end of a job an end of something dear to them and the first response that's that that you see in people like randy and maria is fierce acceptance now this is different from just passively accepting what's happening to you this is acknowledging that there is no reset button and that the only thing you should focus on in this moment is the countdown that is determining everything about your life in that time and what that allows them to do through that process of fierce acceptance is exercise fierce defiance sure the choices in these consequential countdowns are lousy but what then they step up to deliver is an idea that maybe they don't have to accept the deal as offered maybe they can come up with their own choices in the process what's remarkable too is that they they exercise in that moment an amazing ability to think clearly they tap into not pan not emotion not checking out but reason they think through what is happening to them and at the same time as they're thinking it through they're tapping into a deeper sense of purpose it may be religious faith it may be a sense of legacy for the world it may be just a commitment to country or nation or global population but there is a deeper sense of purpose that you see emerge in these people and finally through that process of putting those pieces together they demonstrate a capacity to transform the countdown's so that they end up being about something completely different than they started in they started being a choice between death and betrayal and they end up being a profile in courage they start being about how to die they end up being about how to live it is an extraordinary lesson what if in the discussions we had about problems like we were talking about today things like climate change we were actually setting treating these countdowns as consequential what if we started acknowledging that the countdowns are happening every day in our lives and being measured in roads not taken dreams lost or not realized time not spent with loved ones or at a societal level countdowns being measured in the melting of glaciers lives of soldiers being lost needlessly minds being wasted in schools that don't function what if we started acknowledging that those countdowns are real and started making choices on the fierce commitment to making better ones at the end of those countdowns one of my favorite quotes from randy pausch came not from his last lecture the famous one but from his last last lecture one on time management that he gave and he quoted disney employees and he said you know what they always say when asked when the park will close the park is open until 8:00 and i love that because what people like randy pausch a maria devries do in facing consequential countdowns is they transform the closed into the open they close they transform the negative into the positive they transformed the and into a new beginning this is a picture of me standing in front of maria theresa's apartment i made a pilgrimage there with my son a few years ago because you see maria is was my grandmother and and her little girl grew up to become my mom and young woman nell actually survived the war and came back years later to thank my grandmother for what she'd done and what what my grandmother taught me are teaches me now across the void of time is that acknowledging consequential countdowns is important there are countdowns that are consequential but it is how we react to them that makes them truly consequential i love this quote from mary oliver and i wonder how we might react if we realized if we if we if we rephrase this wonderful poem of hers tell me what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life and added tell me what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious world because in the end there is only one countdown that truly matters and that is shaped by the answer to the question that my grandmother's example poses and that is that the truly important countdown is the one that runs from one two done thank you you

How Do We Reduce Recidivism?,Scott Budnick,we get the house lights on for one second i need honesty raise your hand if you did dumb as a teenager all right now the difference between us is that we had parents that cared about us we had a positive adults in our lives that kind of gave us a path and we had some wealth and some resources but what if you're a child that has none of that what if you're in the foster care system and there isn't a person that you can call your parent what if there's not an adult showing you the right path what if you have no money in you're living in extreme poverty so i took this journey in 2003 we had just made a movie called road trip in a movie called old school and i do very mature movies um and this is about five years before the hangover kind of revolution my life revolutionized my life but the thing that really changed my life was in 2003 i went to sylmar juvenile hall in the san fernando valley right here and met some absolutely amazing kids here are some of them their little art is right here 14 years old facing a life sentence and i walked into a prison for my first time and these were 14 15 16 year olds that were facing life in prison or on one side of the table i met david negrete and david agretti two days before i showed up for my first time had been sentenced to 200 years in prison with no chance of parole ever he will die in prison for standing next to somebody that shot a rival gang member in the but 200 years across the table from him was prophet walker prophet walker had was still fighting his case and he ultimately got six years in adult prison for getting into a fistfight on a train and fracturing someone's jaw so we're gonna come back to them in a second let me tell you about the current state of the system so america now has the dubious distinction of leading the world's prison population we account for 25% of prisoners but only 5% of the global population we're the most jailing country in the world ahead of saudi arabia china and we are the largest prison system in the free world check out the stats here while we spend nine thousand a year to educate kids in the k through 12 system we spend two hundred thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them one child to incarcerate in a year two hundred thousand dollars five times what would cost to send him to harvard to put them in prison with virtually no treatment and services whatsoever our prison system has a fourteen billion dollar budget and a seventy four percent recidivism rate for the population i work with the teenagers and the young adults 18 to 25 years old which means if public safety is the ultimate goal we're actually making our communities less safe nobody in this room would spend 14 billion dollars at their company that fails seven out of ten times we would shut it down but unfortunately we don't have that luxury here but we know how to solve this problem so the data shows that if kids while they're incarcerated to get a high school diploma or ged it reduces recidivism which is reincarnation by five to ten percent more data shows if they go to college and they get their first two years of college and a a degree that's an additional ten percent introduction combine that with all the things you can do when they come home housing substance abuse therapy employment a different peer group if you combine all those things together you can reduce your citizen by 50% to take it to 34% and save billions of dollars in the taxes that all of us are paying and if you don't believe that fixing the criminal justice system is your issue please note that all kids not just kids that commit crimes but all kids are affected by these policies since 1980 while prison expenditures has risen by 436 percent our higher education funding has decreased by 13% that's a tragedy so what's stopping us number one pure politics liberals are scared of looking soft on crime conservatives want to look tough on crime in the 1990s the pendulum swung columbine happened experts at different universities said we have a new breed of kids they're super predators we need to lock them up not saying that kids have the capacity to change as we all know anyone that has kids we decided to treat them like adults fear them and lock them away forever before that richard nixon started on drugs we've spent a trillion dollars since president nixon on the war of drugs we spend 51 billion dollars a year in the ward of drug on the war of drugs what has this accomplished addiction rates are the same overdose deaths are an all-time high and drugs cost less than before a trillion dollars we failed completely here's the good news there's a movement growing during this last recession it's funny that it takes a recession to actually change a system this has become a bipartisan issue conservatives hate big government and what's worse big government that a bloated prison system that fails like it does they hate wasteful spending and you have a lot of christian conservatives that believe in redemption forgiveness and second chances so last year as jordan said i co-wrote a bill called sb 260 which was to look at all kids that committed crimes as children and were given life sentences and this was a bill that shouldn't have gotten any republican votes it really probably shouldn't have passed in the current climate but we ended up getting nine republicans newt gingrich came on board and supported it wrote an op-ed grover norquist came on board not only talking about the fiscal savings of the bill but also about the human value were saving when we believe in kids and give them second chances and david negrete who i taught you about at the beginning got 200 years in prison when i went to see him in prison and said sb 260 was passed david negrete now knew that after he served 20 years if he did major transformation he would be able to go home to his mom governor brown signed the bill on the second day was on his desk and it's now the law six thousand five hundred young kids are now going home thank you now let's go back to my other student prophet walker right here he's not the white guy and he's not the guy with the big ears prophet walker went to prison in prison he got his aaa degree unfortunately in prison you can only get to an aaa degree because there's no online classes we just changed that we have an online pilot we're at one prison kids can get on a computer and actually take online classes and now for the first time ever in the history of the prison system we can get them to their ba but profit got his first two years of college done while he's an inmate in prison he got accepted into the loyola marymount school of science and engineering he left prison right onto lmu's campus full scholarship within a week of getting there he calls me and says that he'll do anything he has a daughter he'll sweep floors just he needs a job he went to a fundraiser met someone that owned an engineering company within a two weeks of leaving prison he was making a hundred and ten dollars an hour not minimum wage $8.00 an hour a hundred and ten dollars an hour week a week from leaving prison working for this company went back to watts where he's from where he saw that all the problems where he left before he went to prison were still existing and he just found out that the assembly member that represents watts is leaving office so prophet walker is now running for state assembly and has now outraced his competition in the last three periods as the front-runner to win the assembly seat and i knew him behind a jail cell at 15 years old so so now is the time for the private sector for us for all the brains for the resources in this room to push government to do the right thing fiscally and morally which is why i want to pitch today an xprize around reducing recidivism these kids have grown up without adults loving them without role models without proper parenting guidance let's be those adults to these kids and show them that their worst act is not going to define their entire lives thank you very much
