okay today ism gon na talk something probably hands backpacks pockets carry time probably think much unless worried battery running right mobile phone want think billion mobile phones sold worldwide average user upgrades phone two years think mobile phones away well people like lot phones sitting drawer somewhere phones see behind example junk drawer kitchen two phones pod touch fraction mobile phones house pod touches house sitting junk drawer right good landfill must feel somehow phones kind value know sometimes move time clean junk drawer gon na phones dispose way environmentally responsible right two main options disposal options end life disposal mobile phone electronics okay obvious one recycle take phone crush extract valuable raw materials things like glass copper chromium materials go back industrial ecosystem make new stuff okay great option percent old phones recycled turns people projected old phones going end recycling stream okay clearly ism one phones drawer second option called refurbishing take phone business business cleans phone sell another consumer use mobile phone sounds like really great option would think every old phone gets refurbished means one less new mobile phone manufactured turns case experts believe refurbishing mobile phones decreases new phone production lot reasons one main reasons customer tends buy refurbished mobile phones usually first time mobile customer soon afford gon na upgrade phone latest greatest features phones go drawers phones go drawers dead right still turn working speakers microphones displays microprocessor runs software ask third option instead recycling refurbishing phone could purpose modify hardware modified software little bit could replace electronic device okay decrease amount manufacturing maybe beneficial environment even ask question first place spend time power consumption actually graduate students spend time worrying power consumption behind integrated circuit computer chip reason want decrease power consumption make know electronics smaller lighter make battery last longer kind important problems actually worked certainly one sort oh realizations right reduced power consumption chips much actually takes energy make chip chip uses typical operating life okay answer question graduate student work john liver colleagues thank touch area free thong poland geyser look several years ago results analysis turns type chip typically see mobile phone takes times energy make chip first place chip uses joining typical two three year operating life okay worried decreasing power consumption integrated circuits kind depressing result working tiny little sliver right takes big box make chip first place okay instead getting depressed sort realized really fair comparison right chip would exist first place first invest energy takes manufacture energy economist would call sunk cost get back people get lot utility decreasing power consumption chips right smaller electronics longer battery life students still work problem wanted figure way get return initial investment manufacturing energy okay phone think phone instead one chip usually six ten chips like investment energy much higher first looked know disassemble phone take chips use places turns may make lot economic sense time labor involved disassembly process instead reusing chips thought reusing entire phone tried think kind device could old mobile phone completely replace terms functionality okay parking tag one looked replacing one left little thing electronic parking tag really simple device take phone credit card charge minutes park car metered spot paying tag put dashboard starts little countdown timer display parking attendant comes look see time expired get ticket whatever yeah really simple functionality instead building new specific device student frank maker create prototype right using old noria phone wrote little ape basically functions electronic parking tag know notice also something extra got little solar panel attached side okay electronics prototyping board convert solar panel voltage something phone likes well ism sure know first thing go bad mobile phone battery want thinking purposing mobile phone something else may want think replacing battery different kind power supply okay picture prototype used electronic parking tag dashboard frank car inset see little screenshot ape works fine look pretty grant hand pretty obvious easily optimize hardware software packaging make look good make look like something would happy dashboard car question went trouble purposing old phone actually done anything benefit environment worked folks experts called industrial ecology lifecycle analysis see global impacts environment purposing tremor university californium manta barber helped us results study study turns example example looking global warming purpose electronic purpose phone electronic parking tag result net decrease global warming whereas simply refurbish phone use phone actually contributes increase global warming okay account different impacts components looked two options two bars top one corresponds using phone parking tag solar panel two using parking tag battery options better refurbishing would expect turns using battery actually better using solar panel reason account energy took make solar panel solar panel reclaimed another product another waste stream results analysis would flip would make sense use purposed phone solar panel battery kind really important point whenever thinking environmental impact industrial production like electronics context everything example size bars contribution global warming depend phone purposed phone depends charger plugged example phone running battery parking tag plug phone recharge californium lot grid electricity comes renewal sources contributes lot less global warming took parking tag plugged somewhere like china lot electricity comes coal fired power plants say fact may matter even phone purpose phone actually charger let us say got phone purposed parking tag gon na charge go campus put dashboard leave charger plugged take phone hmm go campus charger takes energy grid transfer battery phone okay takes little bit every time disconnect phone charger charger stop taking energy still going use energy grid leave charger plugged say time using purposed phone parking tag charger taking energy transferring phone context go looked purposing mobile phone tasks electronic devices looks like going help environment ways think making happen making easier well inspiration look mm hmm joke daughter big girl bed okay almost five might able tell kind likes hello kitty reason want show bed used crib baby crib see headboard footboard sides crib company designed manufactured crib way consumer could basically take crib apart fallen wrenches sold conversion kit let us take crib scale full size bed okay means one less bed manufactured terms impact environment would expect win folks designed mobile phones electronics ought thinking like folks design baby cribs building phones designing way makes easy either consumer maybe business convert phones another type use decreased environmental footprint electronics environment next time upgrade phone got put old phone drawers stop ask know old phone need phone anymore oh first go home unplug chargers thank,new life mobile phones,rajeevan amirtharajah

pediatrician researcher parent became things order reason sequencing important even though doctor took care children researcher studied ways keep healthy became parent got interested might even say obsessed early learning years ago son born took month paternity leave third month life retrospect pediatrician known better opted time colic crescendos spent month snuggle bouncing big blue ball watching daytime television life noticed actually interested much like believe two month old following closely obvious yet something experience important early experiences matter early experiences matter typical newborn brain grams first two years life actually triples size extraordinary period brain growth unparalleled life course see brain growth lifespan see steep rise early continues grow age let guys audience find right see hard time finding car keys morning actually born lifetime supply brain cells neurons actually grows connections brain cells call synapses account brain growth synapses form based early experiences mind fine tuned world babies inhabit give example relate child born anywhere world learn speak language fluently exposed certain sounds early first years life learn speak another language later never sound like native speaker baby born today mainland china amazing learn speak fluent mandarin hear english sounds early life learn speak english later know know people struggle making certain sounds born capacity early experience condition mind learn graphic actually shows see brain see neurons synapses connecting born synapses age three time connections actually pruned response uh external stimulation external world live give another example breathing pattern one day old infant listening music see listening moat stravinsky put moat show present kind infantile critique classical music audience classic music aficionados might hypothesis stravinsky breathing pattern point point even one day life discernible physiological reaction babies actually hearing pet scans know decades research little stimulation early bad brain development show two pet scans pet scans measures brain function brighter colors show brain activity left pet scan normal kindergartener right pet scan child raised horribly neglected environment actually pet scan child raised romania orphanage profoundly neglected early life notice areas brain show activity develop result little stimulation horrific example little stimulation untoward consequences question lab time much actually possible stimulate developing brain appropriately inappropriately stimulate developing brain ways actually beneficial harmful much important technologizing childhood today way unprecedented average age children began watch television regularly four years like cute little girl today based research done four months orally watch much watch typical child age five watching four half hours day represents much percent waking hours brings us baby einstein many probably seen baby einstein show random second clip baby einstein day farm next one second clip seven scene changes one every three seconds exhausting day farm since john steinbeck grapes wrath course nothing like real farm right adults watching find discombobulating mind trying make coherent narrative coherent narrative jumps place babies trying make coherent narrative capable screen change stimulation keeping actually engaged screen overstimulation hypothesis call overstimulation hypothesis prolonged exposure rapid image change critical window brain development would precondition mind expect high levels input would lead inattention later life watch enough baby einstein day farm baby go farm school aged child boring slow come sheep suddenly popping face come marionette going back forth walk general idea conditioning mind reality actually exist results tested uh years ago found television children watch age three likely actually attentional problems school age specifically hour watch age three chances attentional problems increased percent child watched two hours day age three would percent likely attention problems compared child watched none else find found cognitive stimulation children uh received measured cognitive stimulation terms often parents read child often took museum often sang found cognitive stimulation reduced chances attentional problems later life fact hour cognitive stimulation reduced percent two sides coin certain things early children lives enhance ability pay attention certain things early actually impede hypothesis right based pacing programs might imagine children watch actually important content would key give two examples content illustrate point first powerpuff girls movie right mix sugar spice satisfying rush know many seen scene okay see lot rapid sequencing fact first movie ever rated pig nonstop frenetic animated action making back box want contrast something sure familiar uh really needs introduction clip rogers watch hi oh hi fine good thanks brought television neighbor see restaurant like oh glad show table certainly awfully busy today one waitresses ill see sort double duty fine thank much sit right back right come restaurant usually somebody shows table supposed sit uh one first things put napkin either lap well way table set free rogers invented reality credited actually reality right even slower paced reality uh waitress says awfully busy seem least bit hurried see real differences pacing followed study subsequent experiment look children actually watch see educational programs like rogers pose increased risk attentional problems entertainment programs like powerpuff girls movie increased chances percent violent programming show increases even violent programs typically even rapidly sequenced mouse last year building actually mouse model television viewing lab watching mouse uh sounds cartoon network lights uh basically photorhythmically generated sounds looks like lounges mice live speakers lights

forage food point need go middle explore environment put mice test exploit fact white mouse black background computer actually track movement see left sort normal mouse spending time around perimeter look one right notice much time spends middle also notice much general activity mouse actually exhibiting hyperactive risk taking mouse look stimulated compared control mice find overstimulated might spend time center enter center regular mice next test called novel object recognition tests short term memory learning put mouse box two objects mouse explore get know take mouse hour later replaced one object novel object see much time mouse spends object mouse learning good short term memory spend time novel object see opposed one right spending amount time objects find well found control mice normal mice spent percent time novel object look viewing stimulated mice spent exact amount time could distinguish two objects care one way another learning acting like normal mice want us talk little bit study children building block study randomized trial low income clinic settle took children months age gave half blocks beginning study half blocks end parents got call blocktivities monthly ways play children blocks sort blocks stack blocks count blocks really simple things come naturally lot parents lot low income parents children regularly happened children got blocks percent played typical day opposed percent get blocks initially played minutes day one half episodes day percent time parent six months later assessed language see right kids got blocks late scored percentile average unfortunately uncommon low income populations settle matter around world kids got blocks actually scored percentile significantly better slightly average promoting kind interactive play actually promoted language development young children conclusion want conclude impressing early childhood important children mice critical development need mealtime play today less fast paced media

bitching biggest software applications used piracy actually powerpoints keynotes even blogs nobody actually cares care course certain irony story member parliament parliament actually among group people setting new copyright legislation finland copyright legislation made actually criminal copy images publicly perform commercial setting actually legislation setting could taken prison two years

licensed credit comes licenses licenses require attribution give credit author whatever want image crop build upon use publicly perform royalties paid give credit author give credit author well said legal license legal documents legal documents tend look like attribution clause long license many bumped licenses like feel pretty much like reading order get license order infringe license need actually follow steps describe documents let us take example ism creating presentation need find image kids first would leave pourpoint software use create presentations would find source images find perfect image jump found image yesterday kids licensed creative commons license use long tell author image first would actually get flick somewhat difficult nowadays presentation next would find name author something license requires copy presentation would go find name image case attach presentation well next thing requirement add license term people see presentation would know creative commons

case feeling anxious uncomfortable socially awkward versions hearts pounding palms sweating feel like crawling skin also nice often generic people around us ism social psychologist studying science uncomfortable social interactions years everything new roommate relationships negotiations upward feedback boss doctor patient interactions moments need break say yeah last minutes actually idea talking maybe rewind bit study things look three main outcomes first look people say things control friendly much complement one another much give gracious feedback second look things tougher us control nonverbal behaviors things like fidgeting avoiding eye contact playing hair doodling even even tone voice look things impossible us control skin responses physiology cardiovascular reactivity things like blood pressure heart rate types things often even really realize feeling way people come lab interact bunch different settings negotiate get acquainted often case interactions people required give form feedback partner tell honestly thinking feeling come offer negotiations tell could done better next time think kind know feels like one studies might know would really feel like one studies lot equipment involved plug people things measure skin responses videotape capture behaviors mentioned get us mindset like feel awkward maybe potentially little bit nice want think last awkward interaction oka keep thought mind think moments couple minutes ism actually going randomly call someone based seat come share story moment felt like want kind get sense typical pattern see people engaging interactions bring lab hook equipment within moments within first seconds start see stress responses mentioned heart rate goes blood pressure increases take much get people start feel anxious next see nonverbal behaviors start fidget avoid eye contact pull chair couple inches away person sitting next effort get little bit distance one favorite findings doctor patient interactions uncomfortable doctors look chart look computer screen instead making eye contact patients let us return awkward moment everyone awkward moment mind thinking one many increases heart rate maybe palms sweating start feel getting little tingly mere thought called upon today hey many people would actually excited opportunity oka people laughter many call would walk would grin gritted teeth like would even though secretly hated whole time worry ism going actually ruse teach lesson uncomfortable social interactions often social script instead telling people really think really feel nice thing makes us incredibly uncomfortable one favorite findings illustrating effect context negotiations went major firm brought people together used working one another engage negotiations end winner loser said winner know really study feedback would like give constructive feedback person lost things could better next time potential missteps many think actually really followed instructions oka nobody see going found even talking someone lost negotiation us tend bend backwards say things like way made really early offer even ask counter amazing great even ask anything side willing kind know change flexible people layered compliments someone beat negotiations telling great often kinds interactions take form ill call anxious niceness involve lot compliments telling people well general nonspecific way lot work actually looks like receiving end types interactions feel interact someone giving kinds brittle smiles typically kinds facial expressions actually see people kind sneering little bit side

receiver feedback giver people get bit dance give nice feedback kind know smile say thank know go way takes lot break interpersonal cycle think actually want frame feedback people instead asking people nice honest useful like ask people give feedback couple dimensions think feedback general versus specific another dimension would think things well keep versus things please stop get moment actually frame form negative feedback think lot us actually pretty decent positive general feedback right love timely mean could mean time meetings could mean turn work time could mean global way sure managed lot five years could mean something specific like helpful send reports really want comment kinds forms timely kind general feedback negative please stop need specific kind one common forms general negative feedback people get take enough initiative many ever told please take initiative think us point lives experienced mean mean speak meetings mean quicker email mean job without complaining job often actually means break specifics could include things like wait tom ask found errors say tomb found errors important piece people instead often get stage comfortable enough telling

days ago told students going giving ted talk two responses first super cool right would agree super cool right boohoo yeah went kind geeky professor still geeky professor able something really cool um second reaction um want voices heard um asked minute half take sheet paper said want write something know anything would change way parents communicated growing second question said want also thinking think something appreciate way communicated growing one response mean keep mind written minute half parents never got divorce always wish even cheating one another get back child services got involved friends family encouraged end still held ism scared believe anything lasts forever every relationship go constantly remind month year whatever lose wish parents ended back brothers little made feel like love hate relationship important us however always reminded us loved mattered forever always still stayed strong really mattered love imagine know anonymous collecting kind sifting class seeing know know kept sifting thinking know bunch really sad cases majority super positive let us keep mind know really made think professor know looking across students um kind dumbfounded know talked divorce conflict like class period half ever occur student feeling inside think lot parents face similar situation look child think child okay children inside might feeling something different talk parents know today want give children divorce voice like said fancy pourpoint slides voices research thrown um particular want see impact divorce eyes adolescents young adults experienced often get asked question impact divorce children answer always depends um depends upon host complex um circumstances situations children really vary terms respond divorce children actually fire lot better removed really conflicted turbulent environment children um fair really poorly children affected affected divorce children short term impact children divorce suffer lower self esteem anxiety depression less quality contact parents um standard living decreases lot times know short term effects actually linger adulthood long term effects know children continue um psychological difficulties um children divorce average um tend um less satisfied relationships parents later life difficulty romantic relationships much likely get divorced effect sizes point lecture children divorced families students want get walk like great ism screwed um hope yes research actually shows differences effect sizes children divorce children parents stay married small primarily lot variance people children respond divorce really interesting palate sociologist one mentors actually showed effect sizes actually differences might getting bigger smaller um met analysis looked hundreds studies children whose parents divorced um really high effect divorce children decreased increased kind perplexing divorce common less stigmatized would differences divorce children divorce non divorced families increasing know apart one reasons divorce know one suggestions well maybe reasons divorce different used people got divorced really bad marriage right know adultery things really needed get today people getting divorced personal happiness could really bother children right enough um people getting divorced easily ask students well think actually argue children closer parents ever think generation turned ism going admit web w turned right think generation older know talk parents like sundae night week good know good kid k say hi know good relationships college students many um talk parents day every day yeah vast majority whenever ask students know classes hundred talk parents least day text messaging phone whatever use talk parents lot feel extremely close times changing partially due technology things might mean divorce happens close parents hurts setting aside though effect sizes differences still small divorce matters want remember today point one variable determines well children function divorce parents conflict parents conflict would say profound finding divorce past four decades parents conflict important divorce per predicting well children function fact children whose parents lot conflict stay married children actually difficulty psychologically difficulty establishing satisfying relationships later life children necessarily whose parents divorce much divorce parents relate know people married years happily married thank goodness subgroup people married forever really like sarcastic know dark kind wish special section hallmark store know mean cut like h workers always like flowery beautiful like card says married years happy um dark know um subgroup people simply believe divorce ism saying go get divorce ism advocate divorce really painful people think people get divorced way easily um parents also need know way fight affects children bodies remember long time ago field research went family homes spending anywhere hours home interviewing surveying know kids parents everybody home remember sitting couch um child name years old sitting couch asking parents divorce remember saying know stomach hurt lot night stomach would hurt would go school stomach would still hurt hard time concentrating talking parents fought lot asked well talk parents fighting like said ever talk bring makes conflict worse um defining moment big impact research walked away interaction child thinking got something different self reports know surveys try show parents look way fighting affecting children bodies point forward began look physiology children physical physiological reactions parents conflict types communication patterns um things like um heart rates g galvanic skin response sweat arousal looking stress hormones know body stressed brain tells rest body emit hormones like cortisol take people spit stress hormones tell lot things person spit although sometimes people want give us spit little bit hesitant like cloning going uh ana um actually tell person ana um look stress hormones tell someone spit stressed body um example bring parents adolescence lab sit couch talk something stressful parents relationship parents kids divorced non divorced families um take spit interaction three four times interaction look body responding talking something stressful related parents um relationship found example parents really good communication skills much conflict supportive competent way communicate either affectionate um really stress kids right much type interaction know stress little bit get little bit anxious bodies able calm really quickly matter whether parents divorced kids difficulty ones whose parents lot conflict still married kids type interaction anxiety levels like bouncing super ball room bodies less able calm interaction like one interaction imagine parents chronically fighting know inside child body children divorce delayed reaction whose parents lot conflict also reacted delayed reaction able come group children tend really hard time parents divorce ones never see coming um let give kind extreme example um young woman came class one day really bothered actually lecture divorce tend bother people know hand hands sweaty get comment lot make people sweaty um comes class like know thought parents perfect marriage friends always told parents perfect marriage went college parents sprung divorce actually uncommon um said know mom best friend mom confided cheating dad dad know said continue see person break father imagine would person body said professor know like um know think ism nervous wow like like know actually said two things said one ism really sorry situation number two said know information said lot weight college student type information said know worried going wear fridge night worried getting good grades worried going friends type career might instead worried day day every minute day parents going mom really close relationship parents careful tip right child become confidant best friend another parent apply slope think generational difference well facing closeness good know good thing felt caught parents really bothers adolescence young adults feel caught torn parents children feel caught torn parents tugged different loyalties love parents right trying maintain relationships defend parents presence parent presence children feel torn par parents um make mediators give make messengers information ask relay information use inappropriate disclosures small thing example dad says um remind mom child feeling caught dentist appointment tuesday easy right child goes mom dad said dentist appointment tuesday mom like dad tell like father ever talk tell father needs talk simple task turns child feeling caught um unfortunately children feel caught tend creates dissonance anxiety brains right unfortunately way settle dissonance forming alliance one parent mean easier unfortunately might maintain really close relationship one parent lose connection know many quotes got students classes said one thing lost relationship mom dad three years never else children respond feel caught avoid want talk right avoid parents realize exists much keep talking vicious cycle right child keeps avoiding vicious cycle sometimes second reaction become aggressive right mimic parents conflict return third thing directly confront parents say look like need keep actually effective say numerous times comes age tell children talk back parents confrontation right going talk back parents usually age increase competence ability um gain efficacy think ability tell parents like look put middle wanted end positive note said would parents big question felt talk today really important want give parents efficacy feel like something children get put middle think parents feel frustrated feel like control actions control bad behavior parent um well first thing need cooperate try create um rules going communicate children try godparent together best alternative tried tried tried working parent continues badmouth engage let go focus behavior time time adolescence young adults tell respected could see going mom dad go know said two little girls one six one eight know squabble like sisters siblings like one come emotions know mom sister keeps picking say well would happen talk back know really would happen engage fight back gon na get bored right thing happens adults engage behavior actually affect behavior game anymore second thing figure emotions coming robot emery clinician researcher studies divorce said know sometimes parents former spouses really angry hate sometimes really angry still love figure angry um figure redefine relationship longer married godparents trying figure go spouses godparents um effectively last thing would recommend trying take away emotion conflict conclusion general people tend say worst things regret highly emotional highly angry highly sad try diffuse emotions something simple example email parent instead talking face face much via phone email issues tend diffuse emotion last final point wanted make parents important thing listen child voice may say anything try put child shoes think long term impact would listen inner voice thank,impact divorce children,tamarau alibi

hi right let us press play problem uh people think playing video games trivial waste time even parents made living selling video games back well also thought playing video games pretty much waste time though people disregard act playing video games fact virtual experiences feel real stir profound emotions behaviors think play video games live life different character like becoming italic plumber called maria okay lungi visit worlds defy imagination like dreamland final fantasy today would like talk three ways video games profoundly affect emotions behaviors first would like talk video games virtual environments cape makes superhero playing video games also lead virtual persuasion effects finally would like talk concrete applications knowledge like example get gamers exercise play video game tough laughter call people change depending external appearance psychologists use term unclothe cognition refer change based clothes wearing clothes make us feel cool uncool powerful control even depending wearing powerless even awkward kids seem much aware effect must leave room kid kid always wearing costumes day every day perhaps attempt live life different character superpowers researcher demonstrated effect better buck bunny elder fun uh anyone remember characters right um one episode truck full theatrical props tilts costumes come flying air elder chasing bugs bunny characters start switch roles depending clothes wearing like soldier helmet pilgrim hat gangster outfit hilarity ensues constant roll reversal hunted becomes hunter vice verse something like also happens games virtual environments example invited participants online discussions half wear avatars virtual self dressed black half participants using avatars dressed black white ism sorry uh interestingly enough participants using avatar dress black became little bit assertive little bit aggressive online discussions would ask participants know actually happening becoming assertive little bit aggressive colleagues also shown effect example people use avatars virtual persona virtual environment would taller really way boost confidence researchers nowadays also looking character choice popular games like example world warrant league legends associated specific endgame behaviors character choice associated behaviors people enact outside game researchers may necessarily agree call effects agree virtual environments cape makes superhero ways virtual experiences matter let give one example back also president mama bought ads put advertisements popular car racing games also games like example popular madden nil franchise begs question dual experiences affect way people shop online even vote political candidate design features virtual environments appear persuasive effects like example seeing avatar looks like virtual environment endorsing product also lead people prefer product also real life seeing avatar looks like virtual environment get older get people start saving money way prepare future president mama example well also know virtual context sometimes game going fast people may enough mental capacity remember ads regards president mama ads placed virtual environment fast paced people might persuaded let us go back previous example people becoming older virtual environment uh recent study young people like many today audience use older avatars young avatars interestingly enough participants using older avatar behaved like older people shopping online second delay people using older avatars walking around virtual store walk slowly interestingly young people using older avatars selected products marketed towards older people younger people using young avatars prefer products might expect marketed towards younger people addition persuasion context violent video games well turns violent video game context might best return investment may work uh violence distressful also distracting example participants go virtual environment see brands like kami intend et violent context remember fewer brands comparison people went similar virtual environment feature aggressive information appears violence depletes cognitive resources process ads overall might advertising violent games perhaps advisable strategy moral standpoint also return investment standpoint ways use knowledge ways use v virtual persuasive effects example get gamers exercise depending virtual experiences well recent studies shown something really interesting example seeing lose weight gain weight virtual environment get people exercise least temporarily perhaps attempt reach uh reach virtual weight loss ideal perhaps compensate seeing getting little bit chunkier virtual environment people assume gamers coup potatoes necessarily case another example dais tried following invited participants play tennis anybody ever played tennis okay would know would use motion controller racket would play win tennis less way play regular tennis hooked participants motion trackers would measure behaviors actually playing game attach motion tracker wrist another motion tracker participants waste gave participants type avatars half participants use thin avatar half participants used obese avatar playing game played ai would represented theme obese avatar expectation seeing avatar fit thin athlete would remind agility seeing avatar obese chunkier avatar may remind people sluggishness interestingly enough people move real life playing game thin avatar opposed obese avatar able replicate effect sample males female participants worked way virtual influence work males females one real self well surprised people body mass index mi affect results might people get immersed virtual environment least temporarily virtual self becomes important one real self playing game slim avatar slim opponent people move might social comparison effect see virtual environment fit avatar see opponent also fit avatar might people move real life increase odds winning overall design features virtual environments nothing trivial virtual experiences feel real temporarily affect thoughts emotions behaviors people play games harness knowledge make lives little bit fun entertaining also make virtual moments count something bigger would like give thanks tonight students working laboratory might tonight gave sushi lassie flexor poos ye drew cob thanks everyone great afternoon,cape makes superhero,forge pea

ariel next speaker talking uh honest truth dishonesty lie everyone especially names professor psychology behavioral economics duke university uh got two new york times bestseller predictably irrational honest truth dishonesty h coup never lied except said wait true please welcome want talk little bit dishonesty many people lied least year okay last lie lot week going ask last day last hour disturbing study take two people know put room say talk minute introduce person put separate room say lie person almost everybody say say well luckily take discussion let play back sentence sentence let get reaction sentence average people admit lie two three time minute think truth lie lot lie frequently lot um polite social grace way story bible god come saran say saran going saran li laugh said husband old god said worry go graham say graham going graham say tell saran god said yes graham said saran said god lie god said saran said could old religious scholars wondered could god lie came conclusion okay lie peace home human value realization course many human value honesty one human value compatible time sometimes human value fit something give honesty often give understand right understand right answer question honey look dress always perfect truth one hand realize tell lot lie kind social reason hand many people general think wonderful honest people right group uh question mechanisms lying one hand lie recognize hand feel good mechanism lying look honesty general come method could quantify honesty kind developed simple approach um experiment one many experiment run uh one method look like following would give sheet paper simple math problem math problem everybody could solve enough time would give enough time would pas sheet along would say wait said turn solve many five minute ill give dollar per question five minute go would start working fast end five minute would say please stop put pencil count many question got correctly take sheet paper go back room shred come front tell many question got correctly ill pay accordingly people shred come forward said solve six problem average paid go home people experiment know played shredder talking dishonesty um shredder shred side page main body page remains intact put feel vibration noise everything feel right way actually see many question people really solve correctly think find average people solve four problem report solving six shift average due people cheat lot due lot little cheater ill tell lot experiment today many would tell total run experiment people people found big cheater together stole u also found little cheater stole u want think sure big cheater little cheater hand lot little cheater could cheat little bit time actually tremendous economic impact okay method quantifying dishonesty let think theory dishonesty standard theory dishonesty cost benefit analysis say every time considering act say extend gain costbenefit analysis extend lose um think stealing something say probability ill caught much time get prison worth cost benefit analysis case need harsh punishment people would cost benefit analysis would say worth case first let think something like death penalty death penalty harsh penalty hard think something worse would think people cost benefit analysis state death penalty would crime least crime get death penalty statistical anal show difference crime rate state death penalty state suggesting people really cost benefit analysis also ask subjectively last time thought world way must gone friend dinner maybe went bathroom wash hand really new nice towel know nice towel backpack could taken gone home ever think think thing like like right suspect right crossed mind maybe tonight maybe well use lot experiment result cutlery dinner something general think thing like seem describe macro data seem describe subjective experience experiment experiment show thing play much money people stand gain see difference stand much probability caught seem difference economic rational model seems appealing people cost benefit analysis much evidence data data doe happen could say oh people angel people angel either right see lot dishonesty thought maybe going people try maximize two thing time one hand want look ourself mirror want feel good honest wonderful people like ego utility think ourself good way hand want benefit selfishly cheating little bit could say ca nt either look honest person benefit slightly dishonest ca nt well maybe maybe long cheat little bit still think good people right maybe barrier say cheat lot think thief cheat little bit sudden think still good eye example many illegally download material everybody computer okay everybody actually guess people know people uh information many would feel bad people knew almost right people knew think something else many would feel comfortable going meal restaurant living without pain would feel comfortable good know say would feel comfortable guessing actually last year living without paying every time go eat somewhere ask waiter red recommend way eat escape without paying usually say look going interested like would going uh sometimes ask credit card usually give really good advice say wait big group come alley bathroom suggestion say often doe happen say almost never say say sometimes people forget pay pay attention credit card start working without paying say almost never happens think two case illegal downloads eating without paying probability caught low illegal downloads music industry catch ca nt say oh think sorry pay attention could restaurant nevertheless feel consequence modulate cheating real world let go back little experiment say would modulate amount cheating happens experiment get people cheat get people cheat remember cost benefit analysis else would get people change tolerance around cheating think thinking ourself good people trying benefit dishonesty rationalization saying justify little bit cheating could justify little bit cheat could justify little bit would feel let rationalization think rationalization kind thing think change rationalization kind thing good input allow people rationalize raise hand give anonymousness suggestion unity anonymity anonymity usually multiple interpretation one ca nt caught another one think part think part crowd good everybody else doe everybody else doe let tell one experiment everybody else doe continue good let uh let tell experiment time well continue suggestion one suggestion everybody else imagine experiment pas sheet around two change first change give envelope money experiment advance solve problem asked end pay back money make change number two hire acting student acting student sits front row second experiment raise hand say excuse solved everything imagine experiment somebody raised hand solved everything know cheating question still problem number one experimenter said solved everything free go see person taking envelope walking leaving nothing behind would happen morality lot people cheat could couple interpretation one interpretation saying well experiment downside cheating look somebody cheated exaggerated way way nobody chased nobody said anything consequence possibility say society people like us seem behave like seems okay socially separate two explanation tried multiple thing one changed outfit acting student story ran experiment kind melon everybody melon student acting student kind melon student wearing cony melon outfit second version experiment wearing university pittsburgh sweat happens university big melon student see university pittsburgh student cheat cost benefit analysis still know experiment people get away perspective feeling okay people like work say oh people cheater want like cheating actually go okay everybody else people like rather everybody general people identify um said boson experiment deserve yeah restart char charging much go kind personalization might um

general organization classroom lesson students sitting disks blackboard teacher superficial differences much looks organization schools actually changed little time see picture set hidden rules govern lecture written rules make explicit everybody class shall roughly age shall thing independently learning development independently talents lose use learning tools traditional school prime tool texts textbooks follow curriculum set program teacher wants students go judged way examined way give answer questions come think funny mean school question answered supposed unique correct answer going reality almost never happens quiet sit still unless course teacher addresses concentrate particular teacher rules found curricula official descriptions call hidden built system teachers follow less order fit school expects teachers ask kids like rules say particular want thing everybody else reason want sit still youngest son starting first grade asked couple weeks main difference school preschool answered school makes bottom hurt ask want concentrate even understand question want concentrate concentration comes comes automatically absolutely research supports rule rules lessons nothing says best way achieving learning established less tradition extent motivated ideas industrialism want point two consequences rules first one everybody rules formulated perspective schools students problems instance problems reading texts problems fitting traditional lesson severe problems diagnosed dyslexic given special special treatment school sorted ordinary system ken robinson ted talk gave example girl absolutely could sit still later became one brain famous dancers choreographers concentrated moving mean sitting still totally going desire behave learn recommend school leaders change perspective focus individuals instead ask instead talking school says behave class ask school adapt make situation best particular individual think far situation second consequence important rules block motivation students go outside schools kids bored like young children motivated playing somehow division playing learning playing fun learning something serious definitely learn playing reminds old saying take medicine taste bad otherwise work analogy course teaching must boring otherwise work found difficult see logic argument teachers fault school blocks motivation mean rules built system matter fact teachers work rules mean good teacher still succeed generating motivation students good fail students still bored lose motivation teacher question restructure schools make students motivated wish general answer question think identified factors useful generating motivation students let us turn factors bored idea become burner psychologist educationalist identifies three factors first one quite natural build curiosity students human beings born strong natural current curiosity think could say along rats curious animals planet criterion quite natural second one maybe bit surprising says feeling control situation competent strong factor motivation mean solve problem struggled suddenly feel sense relief motivating come back point control strong source motivation third factor social animals would like things together collaborate among people like also increases cooperation read three criteria thinking trying find systems criteria well fulfilled found two examples first example video games video games built clearly curiosity player build virtual worlds interesting fascinating players want go around corner see happens next scene screens made curiosity course coming second factor player full control game would boring challenge mission fulfill computer games often built series levels first level quite easy solve attempts feel kind service satisfaction bounce go next level try succeed building sense getting control competence game even game one player game particular children often play game together somebody else one playing game somebody else sitting next looking going talk game interesting chat course motivating games play together somebody else particularly play team team motivating situation computer game industry successful catching motivation players see consequences lives children second system fulfills criteria quite well call called peeler look children outside school often engaged impaired learning meet friends go skateboarding go riding horses play tennis play garageband often driven interest topic curious whatever topic group peer group good good ones experts area get high status group feeling competence motivated often willing help children group good teach solve particular problem trick play chord guitar oh whatever going much based getting control area less definition peer learning cooperative game peer learning system works well motivating system think recommend teachers school leaders introduce aspects peer learning schools think would one way increasing motivation students next factor understanding get aha experience get kind feeling relief struggled problem seen solution stressed suddenly see solution feeling relief motivating motivating thing makes want go learn try understand question going well think one factor understand something feel able solve new problems see pattern know next gives feeling competence gives feeling control mechanism want point understanding generate control saw earlier control something motivating indirect link also important point direction understand become frustrated frustrated motivation goes quickly therefore schooling situation important

get best shape life went gym class found kept coming back gym really regular basis class called intensati developed amazing fitness instructor named patrician new york city intensity unique takes physical movements kickbox dance yoga martial arts unique part pairs physical movement positive spoken affirmation mean intensati punch say strong class says back happens get great aerobic exercise speaking actually get increase aerobic output makes feel great bottom line got great shape two amazing benefits noticed one amazing motivation felt like million bucks came class could wait go back thought gosh patrician amazing teacher instill kind motivation thought well wait second teacher wonder students feel way neuroanatomy class going come back second second amazing benefit went back work started intensity writing lot grants noticed got regular workouts writing got easier able make associations better able focus better thought amazing want look neuroscience literature understand going looked literature lot new studies coming well looking older studies led current understanding looked found familiar name name martian diamond undergraduate advisor real pioneer neuroscience research really one women working field back late discovered raise rats called enriched environment lots toys play rats play run around lot compared brains rats raised called impoverished environment toys couple rats small box measure brain measure actually thickness outer covering brain called cortex found rats raised enriched environments cortices actually thicker brain grew function enriched environment later studies showed exercise increased exercise rats getting running around lot big factor brain change thought okay area really want get know professor best way get know topic area teach class decided going teach class nu called exercise change brain decided got inspired exercise thought would great could bring exercise classroom teach students exercise brain also teach experience exercise felt like thought could decided go gym course loved intensati became certified intensity instructor certified fitness instructor could tell oh hard teaching classes writing grants truth much fun really fun got learn whole new way move whole new way motivate students stayed great shape nothing better class teaching going teach hour aerobic exercise trained six months able teach front class never done thought would fun teach hour aerobic exercise hour intensati followed hour half lecture effects exercise brain realized first study right students could subjects first study test cognitively beginning end semester compare performance class exercise ask whether fact exercise could improve cognitive performance exactly tell prediction results want take back moment september first day exercise change brain class seared memory mainly really scared nervous give many many lectures love giving lectures one nervous goal actually try inspire kids love exercise way patrician inspired also inspire love neurobiology brain plasticity way martian diamond inspired pretty high bar pretty scared step front classroom say think students bit scared would never come class instructor came workout clothes would never sweated front professor got lot nervous laughter told going say positive affirmations say yell positive affirmations class say memorable first class ever taught students really got okay nervous laughter lot giggling really got shouting affirmations really going workout best thing motivation inspiration oozed academic lecture part remained engaged asked lots questions fantastic first class fantastic semester find prediction goes back structure said important long term memory hippocampus goes back hippocampus hippocampus one two brain structures new brain cells new neurons born shiny new hippocampus cells born hippocampus cool thing experimental studies animals shown increased aerobic exercise actually enhance birth new hippocampus neurons make live even longer prediction increase aerobic exercise nu students would actually improve learning memory improve ability learn new pieces information improve ability retain new pieces information find well tested whole battery different cognitive tests found one significant improvement class improvement ability encode new long term memories task complicated task actually quite difficult task students given really complex geometrical image like etch sketch image delay would discriminate etch sketch image one looked similar students got significantly faster identifying correct image saw able separate things coming memory example meeting lots new people today might better exercise come class differentiating faces different people meet today useful thing able new new well new exciting say people lab lab interested effects exercise majority work done looking effects exercise elderly population cognitive decline major health issue elderly even mention alzheimer disease exciting news elderly population increased aerobic exercise clearly shown improve cognition great idea decline already little bit room see improvement healthy young smart nu neuroscience majors peak cognitive abilities could exercise actually help us studies suggest yes interested learning memory cognition really exciting link topic today conference creativity comes one newest directions study hippocampus known long time exercise improve sorry hippocampus important long term memory recent studies suggested hippocampus also important creativity imagination patients hippocampus damage significant impairments able imagine new situations ask patient hippocampus damage describe tropical beach scene never tropical beach barely say anything sand water whereas control subject would able tell white sand corona left hand umbrella different details idea hippocampus important putting new associations mind help remember events like past past also important putting new concepts together unique ways basis creativity imagination want done look effects exercise learning memory increased creativity well bottom line bottom line simple increased aerobic exercise improve learning memory possibly creativity know everybody wants magic pill get smarter well pills comes lot sweat pills help free helps every day goal next ten years trying figure exactly helping exactly changing brain one question wants go gym anybody okay great thank,exercise brain,windy suzuki
